The Family,"I'm in the process of leaving Mormonism. It's pretty believable given the geographic location, the time period, and Mormon culture.

You also have the fact that the parents were both fucking this guy and were accomplices to him abusing their daughter."
The Family,The real story is insane. >!Both parents offered their kid up like a lamb to slaughter‚Ä¶ BECAUSE THEY BOTH WERE FUCKING THE KIDNAPPER. Both. Parents. Had sexual relations. With the kidnapper.!<
The Family,Eyy it‚Äôs plop
The Family,Something about Jake Lacy's face terrifies the absolute shit out of me.
The Family,He was so loveable in Obvious Child but every other role I've seen him in he's so creepy. Even as Hannah's boyfriend on Girls.
The Family,I remember when the Netflix documentary came out and my coworkers were all talking about it and I straight up didn‚Äôt believe them. The story is absolutely insane. So I watched the show and just got more and more angry as it progressed because of how incompetent the parents were.
The Family,Once you learn this happened within the Mormon community it makes a lot more sense.
The Family,"> In Peacock‚Äôs A Friend of the Family, Jake Lacy plays Bob ‚ÄúB‚Äù Berchtold, a man who befriends a Midwestern Mormon family in the 1970s, only to kidnap their young daughter Jan not just once, but twice. It would be an unbelievable story if it weren‚Äôt true: Jan Broberg‚Äôs story was previously chronicled in the 2017 documentary Abducted in Plain Sight.


> For Lacy, playing a kidnapper and pedophile was an emotional challenge for the actor, particularly given the ages of his victim: Jan was 12 and 14 when she was kidnapped. Hendrix Yancey, now 11, and Mckenna Grace, 16, play Jan at the different ages, while the real Jan Broberg and her mother, Mary Ann, were often on set as they served as producers on the limited series. 


> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so selfless for them to say, ‚ÄòWe want this story told so that people understand what grooming and coercion and manipulation look like,‚Äô ‚Äù Lacy tells THR about getting the Brobergs‚Äô blessing. ‚ÄúAnd understand that we didn‚Äôt get to 1985 and this stopped. It‚Äôs still widely prevalent today, and it most often happens at the hands of someone you know and love and trust. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so incredibly difficult to talk about and to prosecute.‚Äù"
The Family,I remember this case. IIRC the kidnapper was sleeping with both  of the kidnapped girl‚Äôs parents.
The Family,Didn‚Äôt Netflix do a doc about this?
The Family,"Jake lacy is good. He just. Sweet nice guy in High Fidelity, absolute asshole rich dude in White Lotus‚Ä¶ really masters the white dude range"
The Family,"Mckenna Grace noted that, as someone who's developed a reputation for playing younger versions of main characters, she now has her own younger version.

She's been very good in the other stuff I've seen her in - how she is in this?"
The Family,That‚Äôs Plop
The Family,Funny story: I watched the movie 'Abducted in Plain Sight' on a date.
The Family,Mokuba has entered the chat
The Family,Good to see Plop having some good success out there.
The Family,Jake Lacy‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ssswwwwoooooonnn
The Family,"Does anyone know if the phone recordings on the Abducted in Plain Sight doc are real? The one were Jan calls from the boarding school telling her parents she's fine and she loves them while giggling at them nearly in tears freaked me the fuck out. And then the end of the call where the parents are like well ok bye, our daughter who has been kidnapped, call more often, 'Kay? üò¨"
The Family,"[Jan Broberg Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Broberg_Felt)

From Wikipedia 
Broberg was kidnapped when she was twelve,[3] and again when she was fourteen, both times by Robert Berchtold,[11][12][13] a friend of the family, who had sexual encounters with both parents.[3][14] On October 30, 2003, she and her mother Mary Ann published a heavily redacted book titled Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story which completely omitted her father's sexual involvement with the perpetrator.[15][16] Broberg's story was the feature of the true crime documentary Abducted in Plain Sight. Filmed and produced over a three-year period, it was released in January 2019.[17] Robert Berchtold died by suicide in 2005.[18][19]"
The Family,it really came down to both of her parents being complete idiots.
The Family,Is that Plop?
The Family,Is that Plop?
The Family,Ok but the use of quotation marks in tis headline confused the fuck out of me at first glance
The Family,Good ole Plop
The Family,"I started watching this show and ‚Ä¶ I just couldn‚Äôt finish because I couldn‚Äôt believe this would ever actually happen. I kept waiting for that ‚ÄúLifetime‚Äù moment where the parents go into attack mode and do everything they can to protect their kid, but nope‚Ä¶ episode 3, I think it was, this man was still in their house. Smdfh."
The Family,Gross that they‚Äôre using this for entertainment - I hope the girl agreed to let them do this.
The Family,He looks like twin brother of Mark Zuckenberg
The Family,The difference between a class system and a cast system is that a class system doesn‚Äôt discriminate.
The Family,Isn‚Äôt that Plop from The Office?
The Family,I wish they'd gone into the guilt of the Mormon church when it comes to this case.  They knew exactly who he was and what he was doing and allowed it to continue.  I think they're actually more at fault than the parents (who at least have the excuse that they were manipulated over a long period of time).  If you read up into what the church knew and ignored it's shocking.
The Family,"Omg I remember reading comments from former Mormons and they're like, ""I know it all sounds crazy and I can't explain it myself but their story sounds really typical Mormon - all their actions and behaviors are the most Mormon things I've ever heard."" And I'm like.... how many Mormons are sleeping with pedophiles and giving their children away to pedophiles to be sexually assaulted??????"
The Family,Glad to hear your shelf broke. Congratulations on starting your life on the outside.
The Family,"> the parents were both fucking this guy 

God, the trailer for this show creeped me out so, so bad that I knew I was going to give it a hard pass no matter how good it was but now this‚Ä¶? BOTH her parents were sleeping with him? What did that innocent girl do to be born into this evil hellscape of an environment?"
The Family,It‚Äôs fucking unbelievable. Her parents were literally some of the dumbest people I‚Äôve ever seen.
The Family,"Wasn‚Äôt this a Netflix or HBO doc?

I swear because dude asked the dad for a handjob(the husband knew dude was sleeping with his wife too at the time) or something and went through with doing it because reasons."
The Family,"Wasn't this the story gave the guy a handjob in a car because he ""needed a release""?"
The Family,"I‚Äôm confused because Jan is still talking & worked with her mother on this. Wouldn‚Äôt you not want to talk or be near the person who partook in your kidnapping?

The site is bugging out on me if it‚Äôs in the article"
The Family,"and for further clarification, the parents were fucking the kidnapper independently of each other.  it wasn't a threesome situation, he seduced them both separately, all whilst diddling the kid.  he somehow brainwashed nearly the entire family to fuck him."
The Family,Wow. That‚Äôs ‚ÄúNearly Unbelievable‚Äù!
The Family,"The miniseries made it appear as though the sexual relationship between the father and the stalker was a one-time, almost involuntary incident."
The Family,Anyone know if it's part of the show? I know the family are producers so I'm wondering how much they get into it.
The Family,The documentary was INSANE
The Family,Mormons.
The Family,Why was his name plop?
The Family,I‚Äôll never forgive him for taking Erin away from Andy!!
The Family,[deleted]
The Family,I liked him in the office but after seeing him in white lotus I feel like he will make a much better bad guy and now it‚Äôs all I can see. Something about him is just sinister lol.
The Family,He looks like he's going to go on to play a lot of bureaucrats and politicians in supporting roles.
The Family,he reminds me of Nicholas Hoult
The Family,He got Tom Cruise eyes.
The Family,He had the perfect look of a borderline personality disorder case.
The Family,Then you should check out Significant Other
The Family,And yet it's not nearly as disturbing as your face.
The Family,He was great in White Lotus partially because of this imo
The Family,"He‚Äôs not really creepy in The White Lotus, just an asshole"
The Family,"He was very charming as the love interest in High Fidelity, but I think I‚Äôm the only person in the world who watched that. xD"
The Family,He's not creepy on the Office.
The Family,Very surprised Jan is still even talking to her mom given everything.
The Family,crazy that they consider Idaho ‚Äúmidwestern‚Äù
The Family,Yes they did - Abducted in Plain Sight.
The Family,Peacock has a doc about it
The Family,"He was great in High Fidelity, but then again, most of the cast was. What a miss on not giving that show another season."
The Family,He‚Äôs also really good in the Showtime show ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Dying Up Here‚Äô
The Family,Phenomenal. She brought me to tears many times.
The Family,"Both of the young actors did a fantastic job.  Amazing, both of them."
The Family,"She's the best young actor working atm, in my opinion. Her performance in Gifted was stupidly good, as in a ""you can retire now"" level of good."
The Family,*That's* how I know him!!
The Family,I can't verify if the recordings were real or reenactments.  But we do know the FBI was tapping the phone calls so I'd have to assume the conversation in the documentary is accurate.  Those parerents are so fucked up I absolutely believe they would behave exactly as the recording played out.  Poor girl was completely brainwashed at that point as well...
The Family,Yes
The Family,"she and her mother are producers and were on set and involved in making this show

the whole article is about this. I know, I know"
The Family,Have you heard of the Boy Scouts of America by chance? I knew three boys molested by their scout leader (scout leaders were chosen by Mormon bishops as a calling) and molested in Mormon churches. The BSA scandal was also a Mormon scandal.
The Family,"I‚Äôd find it unbelievable until I learned they were Mormons, they will believe anything as long as your saying it‚Äôs in the name of god."
The Family,That documentary effed me up man. The sheer stupidity! It was too much
The Family,It was ‚ÄúAbducted in Plain Sight‚Äù on Netflix
The Family,There's no way he only gave up a hand job. That's the pg-13 version
The Family,I saw the documentary and her parents were so naive. I wanted to cry when they talked about their realization that they had failed their daughter and what they each had experienced. It was heartbreaking.
The Family,Yes it‚Äôs still on Netflix and it‚Äôs the craziest most aggravating thing I‚Äôve ever watched.
The Family,"I‚Äôm imagining she recognizes that her parent‚Äôs na√Øvet√© was taken advantage of by a master manipulator. She was failed by more than her parents, also her school, community leaders, the Mormon church especially was awfully complicit."
The Family,"Yes, they definitely cover this!"
The Family,"Yes, they go into that and the mothers affair.  Also a lot more on what Jan was doing when she was kidnapped the second time and the whole alien story.

There's also a documentary on Peacock which assumes you know the story."
The Family,Because he‚Äôs always taking huge dumps
The Family,It's a reference to some obscure TV show. I think it was called The Workplace or something like that?
The Family,r/dundermifflin
The Family,I'll never forgive Andy for giving us Andy
The Family,Andy deserved it
The Family,"No, Clark was New Dwight"
The Family,"Absolutely, his character was like anxiety inducing on that show"
The Family,My favorite Jake Lacy role is in How to be Single. ‚ÄúAs a kid I dressed up as a stay-at-home-dad for Halloween! This is my dream!‚Äù Or something along the lines of that‚Ä¶
The Family,He was so punchable in White Lotus.
The Family,You should check out the movie Significant Other with him and Maika Monroe. He killed it in that
The Family,"I haven‚Äôt finished season one, but from the few episodes I‚Äôve seen he absolutely captures that terrifying rich white guy entitlement psychosis. He‚Äôs so menacing."
The Family,"I actually thought that in the Office, fuck young Jim.

But I love Dwight Jr."
The Family,"I just finished the first season this evening - he was perfect for that role

Armond was probably my favourite though"
The Family,"It's crazy how quickly in The White Lotus you see him go from ""he's being a bit of a prick about it, but he is in the right here"" to ""oh fuck this guy"". I worked at Toys R Us for five years and have a father who I have seen verbally berate employees both on the phone and in person, including the one time I was allowed to go to Mexico with him. It was a pitch perfect representation of that, how someone so strongly refuses to accept an issue and admit defeat that they dig their heels in even more and convince themselves they are righ. Like I saw grown men make teenage girls cry because they weren't happy with the return policy corporate had said, my job there for the last bit was basically just putting out fires because these losers are a lot less likely to yell at 6'3 man then a 5 foot tall teenage woman. Even so, I had a woman scream at me ""I want my money now!"" because the 2 dollar final sale skipping rope she bought broke lol."
The Family,He‚Äôs not?
The Family,If they ever did a Dexter reboot. Just sayin'
The Family,"> just an asshole


""He may be an asshole, but he's *our* asshole!"""
The Family,Pretty creepy when he hit on the teenage daughter and her friend
The Family,You‚Äôre not! You and I are the only *people* who watched it!
The Family,"I had to read that part twice. Why would she be on speaking terms with her mother?! Must be more to the story, otherwise‚Ä¶ wtf"
The Naked Director,Most people probably aren't gonna watch or talk about a porn documentary with their family or friends
The Naked Director,"Of all the ways season two could have gone, I did not think it would be that depressing.

I've really enjoyed the show, it actually felt unique."
The Naked Director,I feel like they messed up a bit when introducing those American pornagraphers. There is nothing indicating their company hired Westerners IRL in the 80's.
The Naked Director,"I don't know about buzz, but the show was pretty successful. From a creative standpoint, I would have done a few things differently."
The Naked Director,"I watched season 1 and am halfway through season 2.

I think it's worth watching and I'd recommend it to people with enough patience to not be bothered by the English overdub being out of synch with the actors who are speaking Japanese.

The story does a decent job of touching on the themes of personal freedom, big business, the mafia, the government and changing societal norms while still remaining in context to the plot and the time it's set in."
The Naked Director,Don‚Äôt care for ‚Äúnaked ‚Äú or ‚Äúporno‚Äù
The Naked Director,It's been in my watchlist for a while now. You've just inspired me to finally getting around to watching it. Thanks.
The Naked Director,It's not a documentary. It's based on a real character but it's a comedy drama.
The Naked Director,Who watches dubbed instead of subtitled? Crazy.
The Naked Director,"Dubs huh, I suppose this could be part of the problem. I wasn't that keen on season 2 at first but they managed to tie it all in at the end. It's a surprisingly good show."
The Naked Director,"This is bemusing. I don't care about wrestling, doesn't mean I can enjoy glow"
The Naked Director,ha
The Naked Director,Is the first season worth watching?
The Naked Director,"Did not expect this, it's been a long time."
The Naked Director,"I thought it was pretty great

Maybe don't watch with family in the room"
The Naked Director,"Yes, it's a hidden gem, give a chance, this show needs more visibility."
The Naked Director,"Not sure if this is Netflix's intentional marketing, but I just got it recommended since it aired and decided to watch. 8 episodes in 24 hours later and I get the happy news season 2 is coming ü•≥"
The Naked Director,"Yup, it's so bonkers to the point that it jump the shark and its actually for the better"
The Naked Director,Woo! I love this show. Flat out entertainment.
The Naked Director,"I had no idea this was getting a second season.

The first season was fantastic and if you haven't seen it yet, give it a shot.

Toru Muranishi lived an insane life."
The Naked Director,"Came for the smut, stayed for the content.

That's how season 1 went for me."
The Naked Director,"yeah this was a wild ride, excited for season 2"
The Naked Director,I actually really enjoyed this and I'm a bit sad that there's barely any discussion about it. It's basically Wolf of Wall Street meets the Japanese porn industry and it's great.
The Naked Director,Loved it!
The Naked Director,"good show, and its still crazy japan has maintained censoring porn in their weird way. Season 2 might explore this more"
The Naked Director,"As a Japanese, I really appreciate this show and Netflix.
The naked director is literally a groundbreaking Japanese show.
And shame on you broadcasters in Japan."
The Naked Director,"I was really hesitant because I thought it would be too theatrical and slapstick but one night I was bored and ended up binging it.

It's actually a great little show, the lead was excellent, the story really fascinating and it's incredibly fun to watch. Wasn't sure if it wasn't a 1 series and over because I thought it ended perfectly but I am really looking forward to season 2 now. Give it a chance!"
The Naked Director,"The production quality was really good. A lot of Japanese television shows feel like the production was rushed or very simple. The acting was really good too. Netflix even paid for real music on the international release. They didn't convert it to a bunch of low cost music like they do with Terrace House.
 
My only real quibble was they downplayed why he got popped in Hawaii. You don't get indicted under the Mann Act for filming a porn with American actors."
The Naked Director,"Binged the whole season last night, great show."
The Naked Director,"The plot jumps around out of nowhere from time to time, but it's a decent new series. There's just this one episode that's clearly the worst due to the poor acting."
The Naked Director,"Judging from the other comments, i think i have an unpopular opinion: i think show gets kinda boring towards the end. There were maybe only 2 or 3 interesting characters, the rest were so boring. I'll elaborate, Toshi, the ex Yakuza guy, and the head of distribution guy (who helped raise 54M yen). They had solid and logical character progression, but more importantly they were actually really interesting characters.

 The main character is so emotionless it was actually annoying to see him any scene where he wasnt directing. He really reminded me of a less interesting version of Ashton Kutcher's Steve Jobs. He barely has any emotions. Also like what happened to his family? How did his rape impact him? 

Rugby, Anime guy, and Makeup girl, these 3 characters could have actually been so interesting! Instead i feel like they are just showed as loyal peons and nothing more. Why are they the way they are? They had such different and refreshing personalities at the start that just faded away, an example of a great scene was when they were all eating together and the makeup girl was conplaining about the food. Anime guy had such an interesting scene when he met Naoko. When she tells the team how they ruined her life, how did it impact him? Tell me! 

The chick who runs away, she was such an interesting character and the mystery around her unfolded well. But as soon as the MC came back from Hawaii, she kinda lost me, at least a little. I don't understand why she loves the MC, yes he accepts her for who she is, but idk, i wasnt about it. I have to admit tho, seeing the other things she was doing was pretty interesting.

Do take this with a grain of salt, i didnt finish the last ep, i got bored and decided to finish Mindhunter s2 first."
The Naked Director,"Its another netflix show with zero marketing. We are now in an age where good shows are just drowning in a sea of garbage because netflix wants to pretend they are above using promotion.    

Their crap algorithm is also not getting their new releases seen by a lot of people."
The Naked Director,I came across this the other day while browsing and thought it sounded interesting. Might have to give it a try now!
The Naked Director,">I actually really enjoyed this and I'm a bit sad that there's barely any discussion about it. It's basically Wolf of Wall Street meets the Japanese porn industry and it's great.

I'm In"
The Naked Director,Is netflix availabe and popular in Japan ? How known is the show there ?
The Naked Director,Explain why it's groundbreaking
The Naked Director," I just finished the series... What do you mean they downplayed what happened in Hawaii?? (What was the real reason?)  
 Do you know if the story is actually true, like was Toru really imprisioned in Hawaii??"
The Naked Director,[They're spending about 3 billion on marketing this year.](https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-content-spending-2019-15-billion-1203112090/)
The Naked Director,The Netflix bullshit meter is off the charts lately. They spend billions every year on marketing. They also dont cancel more shows than network TV.
The Naked Director,Every other billboard on Sunset is for a Netflix show. They spend a lot of money buying the Emmys and other award shows in Los Angeles.
The Naked Director,This is an old post I came across but they spent tons of $$ in Japan marketing this show. There were even ads covering Shibuya Station.
The Naked Director,Because no Japanese broadcaster would not allow a show with such sexual themes and that amount of sexual content to be made. Netflix is the only reason why the creator was able to make the series.
The Naked Director,"To add to what the other dude said - if you've seen Japanese live-action TV, the production standards are by and large absolute garbage. Shows look cheap and the actors use a very outsized and unrealistic kind of acting that basically means that producers either won't make any kind of serious subject matter, or when they do it's just cringeworthy."
The Naked Director,He was really imprisoned. But it was on Human trafficking violations. He was trying to film 30 movies in 30 days and had flow in a number of actresses from Japan.
The Naked Director,I'm sorry I'm a bit confused. Are you saying that what Netflix is doing is bullshit? Or are you saying that the stuff that people accuse Netflix of doing is bullshit.
The Naked Director,But how the creators nailed the sensitivity or humor to make it? I have a lot of stuff accumulated and I haven't caught it but it seems like a really fresh take like they say above like a Wolf of Wall Street blended with Coen sarcasm or some indie US comedy.
The Naked Director,Im defending Netflix.
The Naked Director,I'm guessing the latter.
The Naked Director,"the latter, and I kinda agree you might not see as much promotion but media sites get a lot of coverage (Vulture, HollywoodReporter, etc)"
The Naked Director,Then I agree.
The Naked Director,"I love Netflix for just SLAMMING shit like this on their main channel.

Most producers would be scared to do this story with an all Japanese cast in Japanese, but Netflix doesn't give a fuck.  Narcos, Kingdom, all their other international stuff...

It's great."
The Naked Director,"As Japanese, I hope this will be hit like Korea's Kingdom."
The Naked Director,"HAHA

>  You never made me cum before!

So fucking savage!

I will be checking this out."
The Naked Director,Binge watching it currently .. not the porn scenes but some japanese behaviours is fucking outlandish .. good fucking show ..
The Naked Director,"Wasn‚Äôt there supposed to be a show by Sion Sono?
Is this it?"
The Naked Director,Looks real good!
The Naked Director,"I mean, they often simply distribute international shows. Some are produced by them, but many aren't."
The Naked Director,Was it as Huge a Hit as I hoped it would be?
The Naked Director,total ego blow to hear one of those.
The Naked Director,"Lol, that was released two years ago. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo\_Vampire\_Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Vampire_Hotel)"
The Naked Director,"No, I looked it up and it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòThe forest of love‚Äô and is being released later this year.

https://www.netflix.com/title/81133621"
The Naked Director,"Oh, so he has a second series then. That's cool."
The Naked Director,"Seems it's a film now, not series."
The Naked Director,I love netflix so much.
The Naked Director,Story about how JAV was born? sign me up
The Naked Director,yo this kind of looks good. Solid 6/10. Which is the best you can hope for on netflix.
The Naked Director,"Toru Muranishi, the ""father of Bukkake"""
The Naked Director,"Stupid, Netflix has made some fantastic stuff."
The Naked Director,[deleted]
The Naked Director,"I'm watching this show. Tbh, it's a bit too fast paced, but it's a good show. It just feels like way too much happened between the the 2nd and 3rd episodes."
The Naked Director,"We have run out of time but want to thank everybody who has watched and enjoyed the show from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for your questions, sorry we couldn't answer them all and we sincerely hope we'll see you back at Portland Row before too long. 

Joe, Ruby, Cameron and Ali. x"
The Naked Director,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
The Naked Director,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
The Naked Director,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
The Naked Director,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It‚Äôs been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
The Naked Director,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you‚Äôve done trapeze! (I‚Äôm an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons üëÄ)"
The Naked Director,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
The Naked Director,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
The Naked Director,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
The Naked Director,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
The Naked Director,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
The Naked Director,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood‚Äôs usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
The Naked Director,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn‚Äôt be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
The Naked Director,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
The Naked Director,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
The Naked Director,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
The Naked Director,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
The Naked Director,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing üòÇ

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about üòÇ) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
The Naked Director,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
The Naked Director,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
The Naked Director,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
The Naked Director,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
The Naked Director,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
The Naked Director,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?

The Naked Director,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
The Naked Director,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? üòÇüëÄ"
The Naked Director,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
The Naked Director,[deleted]
The Naked Director,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Dollar,I think you're missing some important context here. During the time of his deal Warner Brothers has changed hands what three times technically? New bosses new owners. We have no idea what he has pitched that just died on the vine between staff changes. It's kind of telling that he got more shit made other places than at Warner Brothers because there's probably been so much turmoil.
Dollar,"It's so weird because he was so prolific. Is this like in sports? Where a guy is killing it for years and doing amazing, finally gets his big contract then suddenly it's like ""I got paid, I don't need to try hard anymore.""


I think the main thing actually though is he thought he'd have free reign to do what he wants. And turns out he was wrong. His projects have largely been things that would be less popular than the projects that got him this contract. He was trying to go full auteur and seems they just wanted popcorn movies and shows."
Dollar,JJ Adams primary skill is standing in front of boardrooms and telling them what they want to hear.
Dollar,"Little Voice (Apple) ‚Äì It was the first show that got cancelled on Apple TV+

Most recently, Apple passed on another J.J. Abrams TV series, ‚ÄòMy Glory Was I Had Such Friends‚Äô

‚ÄòBatman: The Caped Crusader‚Äô was cancelled by HBO Max, along other Abrams projects ‚ÄòConstantine‚Äô, ‚ÄòDemimonde‚Äô & 'Madame X'

Edit: Some details about the deal and lack of output.


[The Hollywood Reporter - May 25, 2022](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/demimonde-on-the-bubble-as-warner-bros-discovery-puts-pressure-on-j-j-abrams-1235153965/):

> J.J. Abrams‚Äô Demimonde, the first show the prolific producer has written since Fringe in 2008, is on the bubble at HBO as sources say Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav is frustrated by **the lack of output from Bad Robot‚Äôs $250 million overall deal.**


> Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the **budget for HBO‚Äôs Demimonde** ‚Äî which has been in the works since 2018 ‚Äî is a source of contention. **Abrams‚Äô Bad Robot is eyeing a spend that‚Äôs north of $200 million.** By comparison, the budget for HBO‚Äôs upcoming Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon is less than $200 million.

> **Abrams has multiple projects in the works under the company-wide deal**, with Demimonde joining an adult animated Batman series that reunites Abrams with his Felicity collaborator and friend Matt Reeves (who is behind feature film The Batman). Abrams and Bad Robot are also working on originals including HBO Max‚Äôs Subject to Change. Both of those dramas are based on original ideas from Abrams and have formal series orders. Abrams is directing the pilot for Demimonde, which has already changed showrunners. 

> Other projects include a U2 scripted series that the studio is producing for Netflix, Apple‚Äôs Presumed Innocent and crime drama Duster for HBO Max. The production company Abrams runs with partner (and wife) Katie McGrath is also behind HBO Max‚Äôs **DC Comics-based Justice League Dark franchise, which features shows including Constantine and Madame X.**


> Sources suggest there is some additional frustration within the halls of Warner Bros. Discovery that **Abrams has laid claim to a number of DC characters but has yet to get anything on the air.** Sources note Warners has seen scripts for Constantine and the pilot of Madame X.



> Furthermore, **the lack of delivery on content to HBO and HBO Max has created a pipeline issue for both the premium cable network and streamer**, making it challenging to plan for budgets for things like marketing. There‚Äôs currently no delivery plan for any of Bad Robot‚Äôs multiple projects for WBD platforms or for third-party buyers. **Abrams, it‚Äôs worth noting, is working on a new Star Trek movie for rival studio Paramount Global as the Warners pact did not include exclusivity.**


Since May,  several projects were axed by HBO and HBO Max, including ‚ÄòDemimonde‚Äô, ‚ÄòBatman: The Caped Crusader‚Äô , ‚ÄòConstantine‚Äô,  & 'Madame X'."
Dollar,*I liked Lovecraft Country*
Dollar,I wanted Lovecraft Country to keep going. It was so good!
Dollar,[deleted]
Dollar,"That Challenger documentary was great. It was comprehensive and interesting, (which is probably why I had no idea Abrams was involved with it.)"
Dollar,"Important context on these creator deals: JJ Abrams did not receive a personal check for $250mm. His production company was earmarked $250mm of project budget that is allocated out per project.

I think people get confused by the big numbers and assume largesse that doesn‚Äôt exist. Now having preapproval to go after multiple projects is great for a production company to not have to be distracted by fund raising for each project along the way. That is WB‚Äôs expressed frustration ‚Äî we cleared you up to make a bunch of stuff, where is it? But their dysfunction removes any real complaint they can lodge. And Abrams wanting a $200mm budget for Demimonde?!?! There is perhaps a perverse incentive in these creator deals to not be budget conscious, especially if you want to get it over with."
Dollar,WTF they cancelled Lovecraft Country?
Dollar,His production company has co-produced a lot of WB shows and movies in the last few years though.
Dollar,"i mean, the mission impossible movies are genuinely awesome. i didnt watch them for the longest time and my buddy was telling me i should, i gotta say that i honestly think they are some of the best action movies out there.   


say what you will about tom cruise, he makes dope ass action movies."
Dollar,I think a misconception is that the contract amount is his salary when in fact it's allotted budget for his projects. It's just an opportunity cost for WBD.
Dollar,LOVECRAFT COUNTRY WAS SOO SOO SOOOOO GOOD!
Dollar,Cancelling *Lovecraft Country* was a travesty
Dollar,A quarter of a billion is just $250 million.
Dollar,It‚Äôs a pity Lovecraft Country was canceled.
Dollar,"Jar Jar Abrams, the destroyer of franchises."
Dollar,Karma. All those stupid ass board members and lawyers idiot that confirmed the deal should be fired.
Dollar,Lovecraft Country was cancelled ??? ü•∫
Dollar,I'm guessing you don't know how much quality lens flares really cost.
Dollar,He also lost the black superman gig
Dollar,He can film a bag of shit if he wants because he gave us the underrated Joy Ride.
Dollar,"Wow, I havent watched any of these and I didnt know half of them were Jar Jar productions."
Dollar,Bro I liked Lovecraft country is was cool
Dollar,Each of the those MI movies will likely rake in nearly $1b so yeah money well spent.
Dollar,"Overall deals just mean they get first look at his projects doesn't it? He doesn't automatically just get 250 million, he has to make enough projects with WB to earn 250 million. At least thats how Andy Greenwald explained it on the watch when they were talking about JJ's science fiction show that didn't end up going forward at HBO."
Dollar,JJ Abrams is an overrated hack.
Dollar,"He spent a good deal of the last few years working on his TV series Demimonde, which was canned during the HBO shakeup recently."
Dollar,Lou was good
Dollar,What does a quarter of a bill dollar contract mean? Is he getting paid 250 mil or is he being given a budget of said amount?
Dollar,"The deal is worth **up to** a quarter billion dollars. He has to make things that pay out on that money. WB doesn‚Äôt just hand him a big check for $250,000,000 when he signs the deal."
Dollar,How could Batman be anything but Warner?
Dollar,"I don‚Äôt care what the haters say. Super 8 was amazing, Star Trek was great, and so was Lost for a while."
Dollar,"J.J. Abrams is trash and has always been trash. He‚Äôs the luckiest guy in Hollywood, he gets all the money and great projects thrown at him and he turns them into crap. Name one good thing he has done?"
Dollar,Dude is overrated as all hell ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Dollar,"It's a miracle anyone would hire him after what he did to Star Wars. Terrible writer, worse director."
Dollar,Love craft country was great
Dollar,I have no idea how he didn't ruin mission impossible in the same way he did star wars and star trek. I'm sure Tom cruise has a lot of creative control over his projects.
Dollar,"Abrams is awful, just awful"
Dollar,"What an utter, embarrassing failure for all parties involved."
Dollar,"> Spider-Man comic (Disney)

Oh yeah, *that...*"
Dollar,He‚Äôs been ‚Äúworking‚Äù with Valve for yearsssssss now supposedly developing a Half-Life or Portal movie
Dollar,"He‚Äôs been overhyped and has clearly had a rocky track record after his initial success in terms of quality, not necessarily box office or viewership performance."
Dollar,"Benioff and Weiss got $250 mil from Netflix in 2019 and haven‚Äôt done a single thing other than direct some Leslie Jones standup special.

Edit: LOL Okay one piece of development after 4 years. Got it. Definitely worth the 250 mil. For sure."
Dollar,"Good, then perhaps they‚Äôve managed to contain him for bit.  Maybe Warner Bros is fighting the good fight and just wanted to stop him from spoiling any other beloved things with his red balls, lens flares, and mystery box bullshit.

But no, I jest. Any company that still sees fit to give Zack Snyder work is not motivated by integrity or the public good."
Dollar,"Pretty sure Bad Robot logo is on Westworld. 

If this list is missing that huge show, what else are they forgetting?"
Dollar,"When you make a megahit in Hollywood (Star Trek 2007), you are going to be given a lot of opportunity and multiple chances to repeat that success. When you make another hit (The Force Awakens), you're a pretty valuable asset. 

Funding movies is ultimately gambling, but JJ Abrams is a pretty safe bet. I'm not a fan of his work personally, makes sense he got a big payday though."
Dollar,This is great.
Dollar,The less he does the better. This guy and his mystery box have been a plague on storytelling in film and TV
Dollar,"Lovecraft Country wasn‚Äôt part of the 5-year deal. It came before that, when Bad Robot was under an overall at WBTV."
Dollar,Lovecraft Country was a great show but it pretty much told the whole story from the book (or at least what it adapted) and I'm just not sure where you take that story after all that.
Dollar,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that Abrams has been largely silent and removed from the public eye since releasing Rise of Skywalker. That movie is so bad it should have single-handedly killed his career. The dude is a hack.
Dollar,So what? Who cares?
Dollar,Lovecraft Country is based off a book that was fully covered after season 1. I‚Äôm not sure it was ever meant to have a 2nd season.
Dollar,I forgot about lovecraft country. The sub for that show was such an awful circle jerk. Glad it got canceled.
Dollar,His mission impossible series will make back the roi
Dollar,J J Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy are Steven Spielberg‚Äôs sidekicks. It‚Äôs why they have so much power in Hollywood and part of the reason why Kathleen Kennedy hasn‚Äôt been fired as the President of Lucasfilm
Dollar,"People are beginning to realize there is a big difference between hiring someone for a job and hiring someone who has deliverables. Maybe JJ is just a pioneer in ""quiet quitting""."
Dollar,Welp. Also add that Lovecraft Country was pretty crap‚Ä¶ :/
Dollar,Overrated and talentless.
Dollar,Lovecraft country was dope though
Dollar,"Also 2 years of Corona so he probably got an extra 2 years to turn in what will most certainly be utter ‚ÄòBad Reboot‚Äô crap.

With the exception of MI."
Dollar,"Demimonde's cancellation must have been the end of the relationship. Well, in JJ's defense, half of those 4 years were a pandemic, which, according to the press, was when he and the team dedicated themselves to writing Demimonde.  

He'll end up heading to Apple, where he'll have more budget and creative freedom, although they've lost patience with one of the shows, they still have two in the works."
Dollar,Forgot about Duster (HBO). Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been canceled but my wife worked on it for some time.
Dollar,Was Lou any good?
Dollar,WB is probably getting paid by those other studios for everything he does.
Dollar,"Lovecraft Country was fucking good. 


‚Ä¶haven‚Äôt seen anything else on this list"
Dollar,Gosh I loved Lovecraft Country.
Dollar,Question - was is $250million to him personally or was it to also pay for pilots and stuff?
Dollar,"this guy peaked at Felicity

that's all i can say"
Dollar,The fact that they cancelled Lovecraft Country is a major fucking disappointment. That show was amazing and had so much more potential than most shows that've come out in the past few years
Dollar,That‚Äôs a lot of shit for four years.
Dollar,I think is more of a commentary on warners than JJ Abrams. Warners is a mess.
Dollar,Wait what!? It‚Äôs JJ abrams directing the last two mission impossible films!? Nooooooooo
Dollar,the Mission Impossibles will make a billion each though. Money well spent indeed
Dollar,"Not sure why you got the MI films on this list, OP. Abrams isn't involved with them, and stopped after Fallout came out in 2018. Probably because of this Warner deal, actually."
Dollar,Damn I forgot we still have MI movies coming out. Feels like it‚Äôs been forever since the story of Tom Cruise losing his shit about masks on the set.
Dollar,what does he have to do with MI? legit question
Dollar,I mean..not great but those Mission Impossible movies with both probably make close to a billion each I‚Äôm sure globally
Dollar,[deleted]
Dollar,"WTF, Lovecraft Country was cancelled :( .

I thought that was a really fun show."
Dollar,He directed 6 movies in 15 years what made you think he was gonna be cranking them out.
Dollar,"Survivorship Bias.

You can't see all the collabs or reviews he has done to find a decent project."
Dollar,Where did all this hate for JJ Abrams‚Äôs come from? Was it Star Wars? Or the Star Trek movies? I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs the best director and sure his WB/Apple deals may have flopped but he‚Äôs been apart of some great movies and TV shows over the years. Seems like he gets a weird amount of hate suddenly lol
Dollar,jj abrams is a hack
Dollar,"Little Voice was moving and full of excellent actors. I was sorry it only had the one season, although the story arc was completed."
Dollar,"Lovecraft Country was kind of a cool watch, although it's unclear how much of that was him versus everything else.

The Mission Impossible Movie(s) will be cash machines.  But again, that would probably have been the case with or without him."
Dollar,">Lovecraft Country (cancelled after a season)

they covered everything from the source material didnt they?"
Dollar,Also covid happened
Dollar,It‚Äôs also a Fucking crime that Lovecraft Country was cancelled after a season. That show was awesome and critically acclaimed.
Dollar,"He was also weeks away from shooting the pilot of a new show for HBO when it got shut down for costing too much. That was in the last couple of months. 

He's also exec producing a new 70s set crime show called Duster starring Josh Holloway for HBO. That's been shooting this year.

Wasn't he also working with some dude on a new Superman script? But WB can't decide if they wanted a new take or to stick with Cavill."
Dollar,Also his deal was cancelled
Dollar,"He was never really that prolific as a director. He had released three movies in the ten years prior to signing that deal.

And I think he would have been fine going the auteur route if he hadn't shit the bed so hard on Rise of Skywalker. Nobody's going to trust him with writing anything now that he's the ""Somehow, Palpatine returned"" guy."
Dollar,"Everything since the Rise of Skywalker has just had a really weird vibe, the production of that movie was a recipe for disaster already with the timeframe, but the decision to seemingly throw out the Colin Treverow treatment and write his own script that was super confrontational with *TLJ* was pretty transparently done in bad faith, and then after the release of that movie not only did he end up going from the 'savior' of Star Wars to the guy who did arguably the worst movie, *TROS* effectively gets erased from existence by Disney and they move on as if it didn't exist. It's hard not to read ill omens into that and his lack of work afterwards."
Dollar,The Russ Wilson effect
Dollar,Rise of Skywalker revealed that the emperor has no clothes. Such a pathetic result from a supposed Star Wars fan.
Dollar,"> Is this like in sports? Where a guy is killing it for years and doing amazing, finally gets his big contract then suddenly it's like ""I got paid, I don't need to try hard anymore.""

Depends on the players, but usually yeah (even if a football / soccer career is shorter than a filmmaker's one). 

Some players still play great at the highest level if they want too, but most just want the bag"
Dollar,He pulled an Aubameyang on WB
Dollar,"If it were me being honest, I would say it's that LOST was so perfect in it's first season and he was such a huge name that everyone forgot the possibility that this was his best idea. Also it was a weird taking off point for Marvel, Star Trek, and Star Wars to head into the massive moneymakers they are today (moreso than they were at the time) and everyone just assumed (because he said he was) that Abrams was this uber fanboy who was going to do incredible innovative things with whatever he touched.




I would argue that M:I 3 and FRINGE are the only truly innovative and memorable things he has done since LOST. His takes on STAR TREK and STAR WARS are incredibly bland and forgettable and the worst part is the studios are still clinging to that nonsense."
Wu Assassins,The action and fights are good but it looks like a student film. The acting is not good.
Wu Assassins,This is the Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior sequel right?
Wu Assassins,"Just finished the first episode. Overall really enjoyed it, but can't pinpoint how much of that stems from my love of Iko Uwais. But either way excited to watch all 10 episodes."
Wu Assassins,Story kinda sucks but I can watch him fight in anything haha. Idk why magic is involved they shoulda just made it a martial arts show.
Wu Assassins,This show is the perfect amount of cheese with good fight scenes and a charismatic actor in Iko. I'm enjoying this so far.
Wu Assassins,"Finished the first episode.

&#x200B;

This is not as bad as Another Life, but like a cheap remake of Iron Fist. Dialogues are terrible. The story and acting are cheesy as f\*ck. I literally laughed out loud when 1) Iko Uwais suddenly received the magic and that water dragon shows up and 2) when the antagonist making that fireball.

Ok I know this series is about actions and story is not as important. I can say the actions are on point, the first 5 mins are as promising as members here mentioned, not as great as The Raid of course. And there're not that many action scenes in the first episode so I'm not sure if I would continue to watch all 10 eps just to see the actions.

&#x200B;

BTW I watched another show after. The Naked Director is a Japanese drama-comedy about the Japan's porn industry (AV) in the 1980s. The pilot is surprising good! But it's a hard NSFW series. Think of Boogie Nights in Japan with more laughs."
Wu Assassins,What the fuck is with all the lens flares
Wu Assassins,"This is simply not a good show. The horrendous choice of music in the beginning and the shoddy acting... and man, this scene: running over a random chick in a food delivery truck, who then gets up and goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking for you. This is the monk piece. It holds the power of a thousand monks.‚Äù BAM, suddenly guys in ancient Chinese armor appear and summon a water dragon.

I kept laughing at how preposterous the whole thing was. The whole episode felt like it was written by a non-Chinese who knows absolutely nothing about Chinese culture; and big surprise, it is.

‚ÄúWu assassins‚Äù. Good god, what a terrible name."
Wu Assassins,"Terrible Actings, 90‚Äôs CGI, incoherent storyline, bad Kung Fu sound effects. Somehow I am still having a great time watching this show."
Wu Assassins,He‚Äôs just now learning to speak English so he can make movies and shows for Americans after being such a hit with the Raid movies. I‚Äôm all for it.
Wu Assassins,"So I‚Äôm sick right now and can‚Äôt type all my thoughts on this mess.

I just want to talk about the Wu Assassin.

They set him up to be this guy who has the power of 1000 monks inside of him, and so whenever he fights people his identity is protected by the face of one of the monks.

Awesome concept.

Completely abandoned after like episode 4?

Pissed me off."
Wu Assassins,"I‚Äôm three episodes in and I‚Äôm trying guys. I really am, but this show is just too frustrating. 

I could forgive all the nonsensical plot, the terrible music choices, the bizarre shifts in tone and even the awful CGI if there were more fight scenes. 

The action scenes are electrifying and clearly had a lot of love put into them, but we have to go through so much other crap to get to them that it doesn‚Äôt feel worth it. The action scenes are the only reason I say this show is better than Iron Fist season 1. 

There are times it‚Äôs so bad it‚Äôs funny, and if the show leaned into that more it could work. But it feels like there‚Äôs a producer who wants it to be serious and the series just comes off as boring. 

For example: I could not care less about Tommy‚Äôs struggle as a junkie or Lu Xin‚Äôs career as a car thief, but because all modern TV needs like seven side plots now a days we‚Äôre stuck watching them. 

And the show didn‚Äôt need these plot lines. I mean Iko Uwais as a martial artist who wants to be a chef (which is what I thought the show was going to focus on) could be a really funny series on its own. Build a complex world through a simple premise, don‚Äôt just fling everything to the wall and be done with it. 

But everything in the show‚Äôs real world is so boringly grimdark that I find myself switching over to something else and then forcing myself to come back. 

But then all the mystical stuff is so goofy and rushed, you‚Äôd swear the show is just as embarrassed presenting it as I was watching it. Like seriously, how was that scene where Kai first goes into their poorly defined version of the Avatar State ever acceptable for Netflix to stream? 

As far as saving graces, Katheryn Winnick and Byron Mann look like they‚Äôre having fun and it‚Äôs nice to see that there are more martial arts shows now. But most everything else is a chore. All the actors deserved a better script. 

I was looking forward to this one too I was expecting to have it all finished by now. I‚Äôm gonna stick with it, because I got a plane to catch and need something to watch, but so far this is a let down. 

I‚Äôll update my reaction when I finish the first season. I‚Äôve seen some people say that it gets better, so hopefully they‚Äôre right.

UPDATED

My opinion didn‚Äôt change at all. The show just got worse and worse to the point where it‚Äôs just plain boring. I know people hated Iron Fist season 1, but I think between the two I‚Äôd rather watch that. 

More power to you if you enjoy this, but I really can‚Äôt help but think it was a waste of great fight scenes and martial artists."
Wu Assassins,"Whoever did the sound track needs to get fired. What the fuck was that, none of the music fit any of the scenes."
Wu Assassins,"This show feels like the first 3-5 episodes were made first as a demo pitch, and then the rest was handled by a completely different studio.  Everything after the end of the Fire Wu episodes honestly feels like a completely different show.

The writing is... bad.  This is not how people speak.  The fights are interesting, but they're basically the only redeeming quality.  Which is a shame, because some of the actors are really good.

It's like someone took a c-grade children's show and then made it live action with blood."
Wu Assassins,This show is terribly written. I don't want to comment about the acting. Just the writing. It's extremely poorly written especially the finale. Holy crap I've never seen such badly written crap in my life!
Wu Assassins,Will probably get canceled after one season because no one knows about this. Not a single dime spent on promotion. I love martial arts shows but if it wouldn't be for this reddit post I would have totally missed it. It's not even listed on metacritic.
Wu Assassins,"Oh shit, its out already?"
Wu Assassins,"Oh man, why is the acting and CGI so bad? I'm going to watch it all anyway though, because the martial arts and cinematography are not that bad."
Wu Assassins,"The last episode was terrible, like, *really* awful. The pacing fell apart, the story made little sense, I had zero emotional interest in any of the characters. It's like everyone had to appear and say a few lines, even Mr. Young appears with a box of groceries to induce a pointless flashback. I was left asking ""but, why?"" after every set piece. 

Damn, I never thought a Netflix series could end so badly."
Wu Assassins,"I like the concept.  I like a large portion of the cast.  That's about it.

I expected to love the fight scenes if nothing else, but even those are disappointing.  They seem to lack impact.

Summer Glau kissing Katheryn Winnick is basically the highlight of the show..."
Wu Assassins,"Bald monk with elemental powers trying to take down a lord who can manipulate fire? Yeah it just made me want to rewatch Avatar the Last Airbender, as that show is perfection."
Wu Assassins,"Iko Uwais has been in some GREAT recent Netflix films. ""The Night Comes For Us"" was fucking amazing, good story, great action, amazing finale. Plus Iko playing the bad guy was neat as he's always the good guy.""Headshot"" was very good as well. ""Merantau""(may have misspelled it) isn't new but fuck it's good, and Very sad, that ending had me crying honestly. So needless to say when I see Iko Uwais starring in something, as a huge fan of him, I gotta check it out. I was very let down, not Iko's fault, it's the writers, as what kills this show is the cheesy ass writing that makes no sense especially when going into the mystical bullshit. I feel it would have been better if they removed the fantasy and just had it where Uwais' character used to be a very good martial artist but gave it up to be a chef, but now cause the triad shit he has to use his skills again. Cause fuck.. The writers have no clue how to properly write this story it seems.

Edit: Thanks for silver! It's my first one :D"
Wu Assassins,"They should have kept it solely as a crime show and about characters who just happen to know how to kick ass. No need to explain how, they just can. 

The magic element is just eating budget they don‚Äôt have.

Also it looks like it was shot cheaply. I‚Äôm not an expert on how movies/tv are made but it looks like a soap opera.

But I‚Äôm a sucker for good martial arts on my tv screen and I can follow the action that‚Äôs happening so I‚Äôm digging it so far."
Wu Assassins,Chefs do that.
Wu Assassins," I almost gave up during the pilot episode due to bad acting but I have run out of shows to watch on Netflix.  I am now on episode 5 and I am really enjoying this series. Besides the bad acting, I really wish they tone down the soundtracks. Some of them do not blend into the storylines and are really distracting."
Wu Assassins,"Dumb editing. Am only half way first episode, already sense the scenes and episodes have been scrambled!? Opening credits has lead already showing full monk powers? Trailer has triad leader in rural diner getting beat up by red necks! Duh. I don‚Äôt care why, it‚Äôs just crap story telling."
Wu Assassins,"I am writing this after seeing the first episode.  I was  hopeful for this show. Fuck yes Asian representation on Netflix! But yeah sure, let's take the Indonesian guy and call him Chinese, then reveal that he's half, THEN reveal later that he came from Jakarta for cleanup and throw in every other kung fu sterotype into a mixed bag of shit writing - most of whom are white men - and shit CG and oh, let's throw in some kpop too bc AZNS.  But let's soften the blow and throw an Asian director cuz he knows what he's doing, right? Sighs all around.  I agree with other here that Iko Uwais is so great in almost everything he's been in  which is one of the reasons why I am trying so hard to push through this show to begin with but man o man, this is all just too unfortunate. I'm just pushing through for the fight scenes now."
Wu Assassins,"Seen the first episode. Vibe script and acting wise, it compares to season 1 iron fist. Action is pretty good though. Not sure about the mystic side of things, but I'll see."
Wu Assassins,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this one of the first series Iko Uwais has done in english? If so, I guess he's still learning and that's what's affecting his performance. He is amazing in Raid, Raid 2 and those other movies with his native language. I'm gonna let it slip this one time since I know the action is amazing when it comes to Iko being the lead role.

Those other actors (for example the lady who gave him the powers) have no excuses, some of the performances are just hideous to look at. CGI is meh as well, but I think the scene where the bad guy burned the two dudes looked better than the water dragon straining Kai. In the end I'm only watching it for the martial arts so I don't care about the quality of the CGI. Although when something is Netflix Original, I do expect better quality than... whatever this is that they did.

It's enjoyable, so far. I'm having a good time with it."
Wu Assassins,"Overall I like the concept of the plot. I think they have the ability to stretch this out a few seasons if they have one of the element masters as the main villain per season. The problem I have is of course with some of the acting and CGI. I'm quite surprised about how much I enjoy the CGI though my complaint about it is that it's inconsistent. The weaker parts are the 'realms' but I found the fire to be pretty cool. Don't know why people are complaining about the martial arts. I think those are it's strong points so far, especially that one kitchen scene. I like how a majority of it  contains no cables.

Also, I had no idea,  Kathryn W. , was in it, nor did I know she's a real martial artist. I honestly don't know why she hasn't been in more action films. I'm really impressed by her. 

If they improve the writing and upgrade the special effects to be more modern (I know Netflix has other low-budget films on their platform, but with all the big names tied to this, you'd think they'd go all out) I think this could be a decent show. We'll see how it goes. Hopefully, Netflix keeps this show around, despite their increasing reputation."
Wu Assassins,"Everything about this was less than half-baked.  Honestly the whole thing comes off like someone was nakedly pandering for dat sweet, sweet, Sino production cash.

I did really enjoy watching Chinese Robert Quarles the first few times he was on screen though."
Wu Assassins,Post Script: I also wish they would of used asian hip hop artist like they did in the Cinemax TV series Warrior.
Wu Assassins,"Watched the first episode. Oh, not good. Take away the lead actor, maybe just give his role to the Chairman, and leave it as a chef vs Triad crime drama and I would have been hooked. Instead, we get shitty acting, '80s special effects, and a ridiculous mess of a plot. Too bad."
Wu Assassins,"Its not a great show and I wouldn't recommend it to people, but I still got hooked and I'm trying to think of why that is  - I think it was a mixture of procrastination, good fight scenes, and something new and interesting to watch, even though the story wasn't great. 

The development of Kai's character was so confusing, he started of gentle and became a killer because his father died, but then chose not to kill mccoloughs wife because he saw her son (representing kai early on? ) - its really hard to relate to him as a character as well alot of the times  


I thought it was interesting how they did the cut scene stuff, where they would show something then do a kind of ""2 days earlier"" type thing, but it started to get kind of old real quick.   


The music was so out of place at times, but the music itself was pretty fun, it didnt really fit in with the show as much tho?   


The concept was kind of just like Avatar the last Airbender in a way, but with a dark twist  


Also where did the romance between Lu Xin and CG come from? That was also pretty random   


The acting was pretty good overall tho (Kai aside) maybe that's why I got hooked"
Wu Assassins,"lets all pray they invest more money in the live action avatar the air bender than this...

But also bring iko on board avatar to choreograph some fights cause that bro can throw down"
Wu Assassins,Did Jenny and the brother not know who Kai was then? They seemed concerned about him
Wu Assassins,I fell asleep while watching... And it was during a fight scene.
Wu Assassins,I loved it all. Iko is the man. Fun show.
Wu Assassins,The music choice is just SO BAD. It turns good scenes into unbearable cringe-fests.
Wu Assassins,"Those that turned it off early on, give it a shot. The first episode the acting and CGI are horrid. Some of it gets better some doesn‚Äôt but one thing I can say is the fight choreography combined with camera angles is some of the better I‚Äôve seen"
Wu Assassins,"Iko Uwais, Mark Dacascos, Stephen Fung, Katheryn Winnick..... awesome! what could go wrong? EVERYTHING!

Fire Chicken?! wtf is that soupy shit they cooked?! 
I lost it at episode 3, so many scenes that don't make any sense at all! Why put a girl character in a male costume (Ying Ying)!? Is she a male or female character?! 

Man, I admired Stephen Fung.. he is not just a pretty face but this show made me rethink that. It's horrible, I hope it didn't destroy everyone career especially Mark Dacascos since he deserves the resurrection of his career from John Wick 3. I always think he is underrated

Rant over....."
Wu Assassins,"So the fight choreography and all that ranges from pretty good to 'why the fuck did the russian not step to one side?'

But whoever wrote the damn script needs a damn shot to the head, and the director/editor scrambled the shit out of each episode. Just an absolute mess of a show, how did this even get the green light from netflix?

Other points

-Why the hell was the parents plot line even included? and the junkie line? and jenny's fight club? 

-No character depth or arc to be found"
Wu Assassins,this mess may be worse than another life.
Wu Assassins,The main actor does not know how to speak. He never makes sentences. And his acting is so bad. All the others seem great compared to him. Pitty.
Wu Assassins,Why isn‚Äôt this pinned?
Wu Assassins,[deleted]
Wu Assassins,"Big fan of Iko and Kathrynn, but most of the acting is terrible along with the soundtrack.. music does not fit Haha..  I'll give it a shot though"
Wu Assassins,"Like every one in the comment section, I'm having a hard time with the show myself, I'm a big martial arts fan and when you put some CGI fantasy in them, im pretty much jelly. This show really has me looking away from it and not paying much attention to the plot of the story, I tend be a bit more interested in fight scenes than the imminent danger that the characters are in, the main thing I'm having a problem with is the jumping around scenes, which has me confused and is making it harder to watch."
Wu Assassins,"I'm not that deep but I think I'm just going to pretend this is Sleeping Dogs 2 lol

Edit: ....I wasnt expecting magic sooo I guess the DLC?"
Wu Assassins,Oh netflix and plot holes... interesting concept though
Wu Assassins,"The acting, not in general but of certain characters/actors is a bit bland sometimes, not really that much of an issue to me. And the dialogue and acting of Ying Ying is pretty cheesy, at least in this episode. Some of the lines are clich√© too. The CGI of the water dragon wasn't great, either. Honestly, it was kind of bad but not to the point of being egregious. I didn't base my feelings and rating of the episode on the fact that it was bad CGI or anything like that. But the premise is intriguing and the episode was surprisingly enjoyable."
Wu Assassins,"This show is bad. Like really bad. Only the actions are cool. 'You are a killer!' 'No, i'm a chef!' Good god, i'm okay with the cheap cgi, but the acting and the script.. i dropped after episode 5."
Wu Assassins,"Completely lost. First Uncle Six was supposed to be this baddie, turns out he has a soft spot. Then Alex was to rule the world by uniting all the Wu pieces, when all he wanted was to go back to his family. The most ruthless person seems to be Zan, but she has nothing to do with the wu xing. Hip hop music forced throughout. How do we make Asians more mainstream? Lets force hip hop and rap in their movies! 

I saw all 10 episodes, and I have no clue what I saw. LOL!"
Wu Assassins,"I don't get why a lot of people seem to not like this show.  Given that its a martial arts show and has Mark Dacascos, Iko Uwais, Byron Mann & Lewis Tan to name just a few its an excellently done over the top kind of show that completely does it for me.  Really bad CGI but I'm enjoying myself way too much to care about that."
Wu Assassins,This is the kind of bad martial arts stuff I can find just entertaining enough to keep watching. Sometimes mediocre is a good thing. I‚Äôve laughed my ass off three or four times and I‚Äôm only two episodes in. If only it was intentional on their part.
Wu Assassins,The trailer featuring Snoop Dog and not Wu Tang Clan is an abomination and makes this series completely unwatchable.
Wu Assassins,Never once in my life I have hated the soundtrack as I hate from this.
Wu Assassins,20 minutes in.Horrible and unwatchable.
Wu Assassins,Im already on board after the first 5 minutes.
Wu Assassins,Am I the only one who noticed the parallels with Avatar the last air bender?
Wu Assassins,[deleted]
Wu Assassins,The lens flares and out of focus shots pushed me away from the show and bad writing plus wooden cast hammers the final nail in the coffin. This show is unwatchable.
Wu Assassins,"I just made it 10 minutes in before my eyes bled and I had to turn it off. . do I win a prize? THIS WAS HORRIBLE. Netflix, please send me money. I'll film my cat sleeping and it will be of much higher quality."
Wu Assassins,"Even street fighter and Mortal Kombat amateur series on Youtube are better than this one. Bad acting, bad fighting choregraphies, ridiculous plot and the CGI was better in '80s movies."
Wu Assassins,Damn Netflix shows are just almost always bad plain and simple
Wu Assassins,Im happy the actor from Vikings is in it! Especially the other one from Into the Badlands! Man i still wish they Renew it!

Wu Assassins,"Good concept but poor execution.

So much plot armor.

It also feels so much like ATLA.

Haha but Zan (Juju Chan) is hot."
Wu Assassins," 

I really don't understand why kai became so HEARTLESS he killed mccoullough in the end ? making HIM the MONSTER in the end..

is it just me, or is this the way you should interprettend it ?

mccoullough  had given up he's Wu Xing to be with he's family in peace, he didn't  chose to be Wu Assassin the girl in white forced him to. He was no  longer a threat to anybody.

kai..  first the lonely shy goodhearted chef kid .. after feeling power he  becomes a monster, killing mccoullough when he finally found peace..if  you think about it, mccoullough was goodhearted in the beginning aswel  he only became 'evil' after coming in contact with the '1000 monnik  shell'.

Maybe the girl in white  dress in the 'twilight realm' is actually a divine creature balancing  the world between good and evil, ying and yang,

taking  a good soul making it evil, taking another good soul to defeat that  evil making the first soul evil in he's place, taking another good soul  and making them evil again and so on and on ..."
Wu Assassins,"First i was like oh, first serie with asian Americans cool. As I thought it was all silly with crazy kung fu panda with some really bad story but that's what I expected! Then, it turned out to be some cop series, then some fantasy legends of the seeker, then some horror cabin in the woods then back to my wife is leaving me cop drama.... They have all these story lines and fill the gap with kung fu panda.... I'm at e8 now and still watching but then writers seem to have total free hands to do an episode. Maybe I should write one.... hum"
Wu Assassins,The trailer doesn‚Äôt do it any favors IMO. Cancel Season 3 of OA but give us this instead. Yeah OK.
Wu Assassins,Soon as the giant water snake turned up I turned it off.
Wu Assassins,"Something is off with the cinematography, like it's too misty."
Wu Assassins,"A student film in what way?  The cinematography is all professional looking.  The sound is good, the set and wardrobe is fine.  The color grading is a little weird.  

The thing i can only think that looks amateur is the acting.  And thats not too bad. Student film acting is way worse than this.  I speak from experience as a young filmmaker.

Actors gotta get their practice and start somewhere."
Wu Assassins,"As long as its fun, thats all that matters."
Wu Assassins,literally just rewatched that last night. holds up well.
Wu Assassins,Man been wanting that forever ü§£
Wu Assassins,I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who thought of Wendy Wu while watching this lol
Wu Assassins,"If the story isnt to bad/weird, Iko Uwais + good fight choreo (first 5 min were promising) could be enough to carry the show.

Oh and katlyn(?) from vikings is a really nice suprise to!"
Wu Assassins,"If you want a better story and just martial arts watch ""Warrior"""
Wu Assassins,I thought the scene with the antagonist burning those dudes was done better than the water dragon one.
Wu Assassins,">This is not as bad as Another Life

Nothing is as bad as that. I think watching it really did lower my standards, as I enjoyed Wu Assassins.

It's got tons of problems for sure, but after that A.L. mess the writing seems like Hemingway in comparison."
Wu Assassins,"> ‚ÄúWu assassins‚Äù. Good god, what a terrible name.

Yeah, especially when you realize it‚Äôs translates literally as the ‚ÄúFive Assassin‚Äù, referring to the five elements.  Half-baked, lots of little things that don‚Äôt make sense, an overall weakly developed story and world, and could have had a lot of potential, and yet it‚Äôs still fun enough somehow."
Wu Assassins,Pretty well everything you described in your first paragraph is exactly why I loved it.
Wu Assassins,Cant wait for him to star in a big  budget movie so he becomes super famous
Wu Assassins,"Well, not only that. He takes hits and hits like he is a normal guy. I guess he got the power of a 1000 toddler/infant monks. I swear, this series reminds me of power rangers back in the day."
Wu Assassins,"Also for someone with the skills of a thousand monks, he's not that good. Unless he's fighting goons."
Wu Assassins,That bothered me too. The problem was you can't hire an awesome martial artist and never film him. They got away with IMO because they switched to only him after his identity was revealed as the wu assassin to everyone. No point hiding if everyone knows you are the wu assassin.
Wu Assassins,"Nice catch, seriously they stopped using the other monks faces. It made no sense since they kept saying the faces will protect him."
Wu Assassins,"Oddly I agree with you about Uwais being a chef. Based on the show synopsis and the promo poster, you'd think him being a chef would come into play in a realer sense. Like it would matter. He seemed like a badass fighter who happened to be a chef while he should have been a chef who turned into a badass fighter. No development."
Wu Assassins,It's because they didn't call the RZA!
Wu Assassins,Does that mean it gets better after ep 5 or worse? lol
Wu Assassins,"Yea the script was all over the place.

The finale was terrible. I kept expecting something to happen in the last ten minutes but it was just....talking. 

Like why do I give a crap about any of this right now? And then finally something interesting happens in the final ten seconds.

As for the show overall...it was just a poor script. So many scenes came out of nowhere and I‚Äôm like, wth? Where did this come from all of a sudden?

They really need to tighten up the writing."
Wu Assassins,"Yea the characters motivations were all over the place and had drastic mood swings for no real reason. 

!)""No I dont kill!"" then bam, started killing baddies like flies. 

2)CG and Lu had like 2 conversations, now they are in love.

3)) Alec time jumped, finds his family, doesn't run into his former self, then gets killed anti-climatically in a way that made Ying look like an A hole. 

4) Wu's are supposed to be super powerful, get killed pretty easily, without even seeing much of their abilities.

5) Lu: ""I want Six dead!"" ... Six dies.. Lu: "" I will avenge him!"" like wtf?

The list goes on... 

I kept watching hoping to see some Wu violence.. didn't even get that."
Wu Assassins,Not a single dime was spent on the order and the society promotion and they got renewed. Logged on Netflix a couple minutes ago and it's the top recommendation for me...
Wu Assassins,"I'm sticking with it even though the acting is just about as cringe and amateur as it gets, some are better than others though like Katheryn's character but she's pretty amazing overall. Some of it kind of feels like some cheap Asian films I've seen. I'd say most of the actors are pretty good but the script is just so bad minus the actual martial arts. They didn't need all that CGI, especially since it was poorly done. The story in itself I think is interesting and has potential to be a great series but the development is just not maturing well and things are kind of just happening without being tied together well."
Wu Assassins,It's not like it started well...
Wu Assassins,"I watched the whole thing too and the ending was just like... the fucking worst. The main character is all like, I don't want to kill, and then in the last episode he's all like, I gotta kill this guy because I hate him, but that dude had way more redemptive qualities then uncle six and I'm just left like... wtf? His wife and child are right there dude. 

Not to mention the whole time paradox issue. Or the dao being ruled by some dominatrix whom no one questions except for alec who tells her he's coming for her too... WHICH HE FUCKING DOESNT.  

I know I know... late to the party but holy shit"
Wu Assassins,It was completely unclear to me why the bad guys actions would end the world. So it seemed like Kai was just murdering a man whose crimes were in the past.
Basketball or Nothing,"My comment history in the past few days is filled with this show because I genuinely enjoyed it and discussing theories, jokes etc. brings me joy. Yet I still haven't devoted time to write so many words. 

Why are you wasting your time on things that do not bring you joy? The original trilogy was also a fanfiction. Arwen saving Frodo is 100% something only a fanfiction writer could come up with. Yet now it is a beloved part of an alternate retelling of the story. If the show could fill vast blanks of space of the Second Age with similar 'fanfictions' I am fine with it. In fact for like 90% of what I was seeing in the first episodes, I was fine with it as well. You should just let it go. Find things that makes you happy."
Basketball or Nothing,"I appreciate the sentiment. But the people enjoying the show, the general casual viewer, hasn‚Äôt taken a second thought why anyone else doesn‚Äôt enjoy it. Most people accept some people like things and others don‚Äôt. Most humans are too selfish to give pause to a differing opinion and in this case it‚Äôs so trivial who cares? It‚Äôs a tv show. Like it. Don‚Äôt like it. No one cares except for a those share the same viewpoint or are toxic and looking to argue over trivial matters."
Basketball or Nothing,This would all be valid criticism if we weren't 2 episodes into a 5 season story. But we're only 2 episodes in. This could all still go either way.
Basketball or Nothing,Reason being that some people *live* to use the internet to shit on new content.
Basketball or Nothing,"As someone who is enjoying the show, I actually really appreciate this explanation. And the argument is totally valid. To each their own üôÇ

PS: the hobbit movie genuinely angered me"
Basketball or Nothing,Lol so many words for a thing you don‚Äôt like - learn to value your time m8
Basketball or Nothing,"I think you really like complaining about the show, looking at your history. A little too much, actually, it's not healthy to spend so much time on something trivial and not enriching your life. That's not to say you don't have some valid points, I didn't love the first episode but I didn't hate it and I'll be hanging in there because I dig the genre."
Basketball or Nothing,I haven't even read your post and I don't really care about it either. Can't the mods just limit posts about this show? Most of them have extremely toxic comment sections and it's just the same shit over and over again. Like can't the mods make a thread to discuss this? For the last few days it's just been posts about this show.
Basketball or Nothing,"They most definitely could have made a decent LOTR show and they still might - but only if they change course for season 2.

You are right - Galadriel as the main character is not working.  She comes across as an arrogant brat at times, nothing at all what Tolkien wrote.  You have to have a likeable lead and atm she is far from likeable.  

There are also a few issues i have with characters appearing when they shouldn't, or where the casting is off - and i am not talking about race swapping.  Galadriel for example is Celebrimbor's aunt and is portrayed by a 25 yo while Celebrimbor looks 70.  Just small things that break immersion.

I still have hope for the show though."
Basketball or Nothing,Amazon decided they weren‚Äôt serious about quality story telling the moment they decided to hire show runners and head writers whose sole credit was part of the committee that wrote Star Trek: Beyond.
Basketball or Nothing,After reading most of this to me it just sounds like y'all needa get of Tolkien's dick. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Basketball or Nothing,"What made LotR movies good was that they threw out a lot of what Tolkien wrote and made a good movie.

What made the Hobbit bad was that they told the story Tolkien wrote and it is stupid.  It is a child's story with Bilbo taking the place of the child in the story.  The dwarves are near idiots and no one else is much smarter."
Basketball or Nothing,"My 2 oldest brothers lived on the books. I was much younger than they were & would always go & check out their ""library"" & try to read through these volumes.   Never made it through. Not to say I didn't love books, love them. And quite a many that my oldest brother & I share. Funny thing is, my two oldest brothers-one loved the movies(LoTR), the other thought they were crap. I loved them, never having made it through the books.  I think you're generalizing every other individual's likes or dislikes. If it were that easy, & it was accurate-don't you think there would be far more success in creating these movies/tv series?"
Basketball or Nothing,"Because I find it valuable to discuss art and how you feel about it, even art that you don't really like. 

Passionate criticism is not anathema to good art, in fact no passion at all is probably the worst possible outcome."
Basketball or Nothing,That's why my post is directed at people who say they can't understand why some people don't like it and to explain why.
Basketball or Nothing,"It's also written by someone who decided they didn't like it before one second of the show was aired.

> many of us were never going to like this show

That says it all right there. The whole post OP made sounds like someone trying to justify being on Team I Hate This."
Basketball or Nothing,What?
Basketball or Nothing,"Hey, I'm glad you are enjoying it. Don't let anyone take away from that."
Basketball or Nothing,[deleted]
Basketball or Nothing,"I have made [another reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/x52jeh/lotr_the_rings_of_power_forges_biggest_premiere/imyxlwb/?context=3) somewhere about the lore changes. Summary: there was nothing negatively surprising, the show marketed itself to fans with no misdirection and fans have received what they hoped or feared they'd receive.

So I do agree that if you had decided this was not for you before the show aired, the show wouldn't have provided a thing that would have changed your mind."
Basketball or Nothing,"No one is going to take you seriously because you're judging a book based on the first few pages. Reserve your judgment until you see where it's going.

> Seeing how they chose to introduce the world, its characters, and seeing the newly invented scenes and listening to the dialogue, I'm afraid they failed at the monumental task that was set for them.

This is ridiculously premature judgment."
Basketball or Nothing,I understand. Those people don‚Äôt care.
Basketball or Nothing,"I despite how much reddit criticism is based on this thinking.

Or people who claim they hate it fairly but you can see were intensely negative prior to release. 

It's like people don't understand hating something before it comes out invalidates your opinion on it"
Basketball or Nothing,"I hate fucking teams, man. It sucks you think that of me, someone you don't even know. Teams are the whole reason why everything on the internet gets polarized and people upvote/downvote based on if they agree or not, instead of if the post is attempting meaningful discussion and is not trolling or just flat out false information. Evidently you are only allowed to have an opinion of the show if it's a positive one.

I didn't say I decided I didn't like it before watching it. In fact, I really wanted to like it. I gave my reasons why I thought disliking it was almost inevitable, but also gave specific reasons why I thought many of the writing decisions were not good and how it could have been better.

I'm still going to keep watching it, and I hope I'm wrong. Because I want to like it."
Basketball or Nothing,"Well it‚Äôs only two episodes in, so I reserve the right to unleash my hatred as the season progresses. But seriously, I totally get your point. I‚Äôve seen plenty of book and manga adaptations. Filler is usually pretty garbage. Let‚Äôs hope this is one of the exceptions."
Basketball or Nothing,Especially in a race that lives for thousands of years.
Basketball or Nothing,Totally agree. That doesn't mean it's not worth discussing.
Basketball or Nothing,"You specifically said you were never going to like it.

I did not shut down dialogue, you did. I also never said you are only allowed to have an opinion if it's positive. You were clearly butthurt about this show before it ever aired, whereas I have no opinion because I have not yet watched it.

It's hilarious that you complain about polarization, and yet, this is you

> many of us were never going to like this show

> Tolkien fans agree on why these movies were vastly inferior to the original trilogy

> Tolkien, a literary giant and one of the undisputed masters of the fantasy genre

So, point 1, you pre-decided.

Point 2, I agree but your tone is implicit bias and more or less says if you like those movies, you aren't a fan. There is a big different between ""I thought the movies were poorly made and didn't hold up to the previous trilogy"" and ""fans agree this is garbage"".

Point 3. I dispute it whole heartedly. I found the LOTR books to be really boring. I think he had a fantastic imagination, he knew how to create compelling narratives, but his prose I found to be just boring and overblown and overstuffed. The fact that the movies excised a lot of material and much of it was not missed supports my point. Generally, when the story ends, you should stop the book and not continue for another 300 pages. 

YOU made biased implications. YOU inferred people aren't real fans if they liked it. YOU made this a team based discussion."
Basketball or Nothing,">I found the LOTR books to be really boring.

Well, there we go. That's all I needed to hear. The show is good for people who found LoTR boring. Pretty much the entire premise of my post. Really nothing else to say to each other past that point. Have a nice one."
Basketball or Nothing,"Right. I must not be a real fan, which is why I will like the show. 

Keep playing for that team.

Edit: Plus, you claimed you were interested in actual discussion, but when I dared go against the one true opinion, you don't want to talk. You don't want a conversation, you want an echo chamber."
Basketball or Nothing,So nothing then?
Basketball or Nothing,I'm just gonna skip to the episode where they miss out on Top 4 to Spurs.
Basketball or Nothing,the revamped Amazon search function will automatically load the show even 0

Basketball or Nothing,Could you make a ‚ÄúSort by‚Äù feature that‚Äôs by IMDB Popularity rating? Or some other way to better find the big names that got passed up?
Basketball or Nothing,"Interesting site. Keep it going and good luck. In some future version, you might make it searchable or displayable by last names and later by year of audition as you get more data.

Don't worry too much and don't be discouraged, the first version is always the roughest -  refining it and filling in the data gaps (e.g. the year of audition, etc) will help it improve."
Basketball or Nothing,Got a list because that website is heinous to navigate on a mobile
Basketball or Nothing,I didn't see Marc Maron on the list.
Basketball or Nothing,I need a supercut of Don Pardo saying every single name on that list. Because that's what I heard as I scrolled through it.
Basketball or Nothing,"Really neat idea, the execution needs work though. I'd really recommend rethinking the way you've designed the site. The actual list of people is the most important part and while it's fairly easy to reach through the top menu it should really be front and center imo, as it stands it feels like someone's trying to sell me something rather than present some interesting information. Secondly I would strongly consider dividing the list into successful and unsuccessful auditions and either sorting it chronologically or giving people the option to sort it chronologically or alphabetically or whatever.

Having said all that I really think getting all that data is by and far the hardest part of this endeavor so with some fairly rudimentary changes to the web design aspect I think it could be really great."
Basketball or Nothing,I don't see Nick Rutherford on the list.
Basketball or Nothing,They passed on Jordan Peele?! Whoever made that decision really fucked up.
Basketball or Nothing,Definitely interesting but noticed something you might want to fix on the website. When I was looking through the list of everyone who failed I got to the bottom pressed page 2 but it didn't bounce me back to the top of the page I had to manually scroll up.
Basketball or Nothing,You still have a template tile up at [https://www.saturdaynightproject.com/audition-profiles](https://www.saturdaynightproject.com/audition-profiles). Right after Aubrey Plaza. I can't believe Audionee Example wasn't cast! ;-)

Basketball or Nothing,"Yea the website is not great; first person I clicked on had no info other than age, where they‚Äôre from, and a dead YouTube link."
Basketball or Nothing,"The list is not correct. There are some glaring mistakes. Chris Kattan, Fred Armisen, and John Belushi were never cast members?"
Basketball or Nothing,"Great idea, kind of hard to navigate the names list though, having to click the arrows to see all the different page numbers, as well as the list sending you back to page 1 every time you go back. Also being able to filter the ones who did and didn't make it would be helpful. Also personally think the thumbnails of each auditionee is too large."

Basketball or Nothing,"He's already in Mad TV for about 5-6 years at that point and SNL needed someone to play Obama. SNL chose to use Fred Armisen instead.

If Jordan were in SNL in that year, that cast would be more stacked. That's the generation that had Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, Andy Samberg, Fred Armisen, Will Forte, Set Meyers and Amy Poehler."
Basketball or Nothing,"The guy who retired from acting because he was better and more comfortable writing and directing? That one makes perfect sense, these aren't auditions for writers. Love the guy enough to have listened to the director commentary on Get Out. Jordan himself agrees he is not an on screen talent."
Basketball or Nothing,hahah i loved their old stuff! thank you
Basketball or Nothing,It can eventually and give exposure to funny people that aren‚Äôt common names. Plus it shows any current funny people who didn‚Äôt get cast on Snl there are lots who became just as famous on their face own. Hopeful and positive for them.
Basketball or Nothing,"Also some people are more pure actors and others are more stand ups. Chris Rock is a great example, he was on SNL for a few seasons but really he is a stand up. 
To be good on SNL you have to be a flexible comedic actor."
Basketball or Nothing,"Or bounced after a year or two, Robert Downey Jr was a featured or cast member"
Basketball or Nothing,"I wonder what would happen if some people did not get the show and were able to be free on podcasts. If Pete and Che were not on the show would they be doing huge podcasts and stand up? 
I bring them up because they are friends with LOS but basically can‚Äôt do those podcasts for fear of being canceled."
Basketball or Nothing,Yeah we already have a Jordan peel. Isn‚Äôt Kenan Thompson just the best??
Basketball or Nothing,[removed]
Basketball or Nothing,"thanks for catching, adding that to the list of things to fix - i mentioned this elsewhere but there were 18,867 unique fields, i did my best to avoid mistakes but some got through and I""m correcting each one as they come up"
Basketball or Nothing,"so there's a filter that was created that was working 2 days ago, and now is not - working on getting that fixed as we speak - will keep updating/improving iteratively as I go"
Basketball or Nothing,Thank you but that's OK - keep doing what you are doing!
Basketball or Nothing,Oh good! I don't know if it's just my old iPhone but the search didn't work for me on mobile.
Basketball or Nothing,Hey sorry man totally forgot to respond. I'd love to help you out but sadly I'm no web designer.
Basketball or Nothing,"Okay then, to be quite frank, your website is extremely hard to actually navigate.

Also he auditioned in 2013, not 2003."
Basketball or Nothing,"He was also hilarious on MadTV. He actually was in competition with Key for a spot on that show. Apparently the showrunners only wanted/needed one Black cast member so they were going to let one of them go. But they ended up keeping both Key and Peele because they were both awesome, especially together."
Basketball or Nothing,Except when you watch him on Key and peel. The man was magnificent. Left his fans wanting so much more. So I respect the man and respectfully disagree. He is an amazingly nuanced actor.
Basketball or Nothing,"Okay... Look I think it's a nice idea and a useful resource for people that are interested. But they're also looking to sell tshirts, mugs, towels etc on the back of this with 'Saturday Night Project' branding. It just seems strange to me, and not something that's worth their while alongside what is essentially a database."
Basketball or Nothing,The best ? He always cracks a smile no matter the scene.
Basketball or Nothing,This is fodder for that ‚Äúcan we have McDonald‚Äôs‚Äù meme.
Basketball or Nothing,[deleted]
Basketball or Nothing,Ok you guys know Jordan Peeles range and ability better than he does lol. Dude said himself hes not an actor and glad to be done with it.
Basketball or Nothing,"Absolutely agree with you. I was able to appreciate Key more when I saw him in other roles, but next to Peele he looked like a hammy borscht belt vaudevillian. Peele is so riveting in the subtlety and deliberateness of his performances. I'm over the moon for his subsequent success but i sure miss his acting."
Basketball or Nothing,I agree. Seems like they had a good idea and decided to make a website. Then they found out that costs money and needed to monetize the website. Then the monetization methods kinda pushed away the original idea.
Basketball or Nothing,I hear ya. They‚Äôll probably make changes over time.
Basketball or Nothing,I was sarcastic
Basketball or Nothing,"Of course I know him. He‚Äôs me.

Can‚Äôt promise copious amounts of time to dedicate to this, but it‚Äôs an interesting project and I‚Äôd at least be willing to take a look at cleaning some stuff up if you want."
Basketball or Nothing,"I mean, by this point we‚Äôve seen hours on hours of his sketch-acting ability ourselves. We really can make an informed opinion that justifiably contradicts his.

And his Barack was really good. Definitely good enough for SNL."
Basketball or Nothing,"You're not wrong for having opinion, or for accurately reporting his own self-assessment; it's just that a lot of his fans would respectfully disagree with that assessment. I was blown away by his performances across a range of characters."
Basketball or Nothing,"both fair and valid points - i have no expectations of selling anything, i've never done anything like this before so i'm trying everything out - if those cause more harm than good, or just aren't of interest, i'll get rid of them

the remaining plan is to interview actual people on youtube about their auditons as little series, and have those videos be on their pages"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I would give anything for this.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Please god
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,yes please
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I would be all in
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Yes! Do it! :-)
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"You son of a bitch, I‚Äôm in"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I live for this show.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,And Billy Drago :(
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,You didn‚Äôt like it? I thought it was a blast
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Same
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Just don‚Äôt have it on Starz
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Same!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,You don't know Jack
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Sho Nuff!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,You love to hear it
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,What happened with them in the game??
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,To be honest. I half expected Bill to still be alive when Joel and Ellie came through. I thought he was making Frank think they were ending together as a way to comfort him while passing.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Frank has the strongest Gay-dar ever apparently.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"After watching the first season of the white lotus, I told my wife that I‚Äôd watch Murray Bartlett do a one man show in an empty room.

We almost got that, plus Nick Offerman knocking it out of the park.

Absolutely outstanding hour of TV."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,The way they completely rewrote their entire characters to the exact opposite of their original story while keeping the exact same meaning to Joel's arc within the overall story really impressed me.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Whenever I see an episode or chapter like this in a story, it makes me think of the ‚Äúturtle chapter‚Äù in the book Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. It‚Äôs a chapter that doesn‚Äôt follow the main family at all, but rather, a turtle struggling to cross a road. The entire chapter is just a statement of the theme, and a predictor of what‚Äôs to come for the family. I LOVE well-done turtle chapters, and this episode was a masterclass of it.

Edit: just went to check, and funnily enough, the turtle chapter is chapter 3 in Steinbeck‚Äôs classic"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"> Against two heavy episodes, however, Mazin wanted to shake things up with Bill and Frank in Episode 3. He explained:

>""Well, I had this instinct that, after the story of the first episode, which is almost movie length and very tense and very upsetting, where we see the world fall apart, and then we see Joel and Ellie meeting each other, and they don‚Äôt like each other, and they head out into an adventure, and then the second episode is in this destroyed open city, and there‚Äôs more danger and more action and tragedy, I needed a breath. I needed an episode to just take a breath. I started to think, naturally, about how what would happen next is that we would get to Bill. The way Neil had designed Bill‚Äôs character in the game, he becomes a partner to you, in gameplay. Some of what he was, was connected specifically to the needs of gameplay. But also, he was a dark omen of what Joel could become, if he didn‚Äôt open his heart back up to somebody else.""

> With Episode 3, Mazin dared to ask Druckmann if they could accomplish the same effect of the Bill and Frank storyline, but in a more positive manner. With gameplay no longer a factor, he decided instead to flesh out the relationship and be more open with their love for each other. The teaser already gave some idea as to how this could play out, showing the moment that Bill and Frank first meet and how they collaborate to survive. Instead of showing the downfalls of not opening up, Mazin explains that instead, with the right care, it can be a success story. He adds:

> I thought that maybe, since we could disconnect Bill from Joel and Ellie, in terms of gameplay, we could expand on this hint of a partnership with Bill and Frank, and maybe give it a slightly different, or actually a radically different, ending. That is when I pick up the phone and say, ‚ÄúNeil, I‚Äôve got a radical idea. Maybe it‚Äôs not a negative or dark omen, but actually a sign of hope. There is a chance that, in this world, as dangerous and terrible as it is, there can be positive love and a successful long-term relationship.‚Äù

> For Joel, that message would ring equally true. After the emotional devastation of losing his daughter Sarah and later the death of his smuggling partner Tess, he became more closed off than ever, as the plague had taken just about everything. To see Bill and Frank able to keep a strong relationship, or at the very least end on much better terms, would prove that love can survive and thrive through even a destroyed world and how that love can provide strength even as things are falling apart. Mazin explains how love of all kinds‚Äîfrom the caring, gentle kind to the vengeful, protective sort‚Äîis at the heart of The Last of Us and how he won over Druckmann with his overtures‚Ä¶.."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"At the end of Episode 2 I was so confused about why Tess would tell Joel to bring Ellie to Bill and Frank and that they would take care of her. It was a change that didn't make sense to me.  
But after watching this episode it makes perfect sense. Frank is loving and nurturing."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I loved it. As someone who recently played through both games the change was refreshing. I don't think a lot of people realize how much the downtime of looting/puzzle solving in the video game world breaks up the tension and emotion of a lot of the more poignant story moments. If the show followed the game to a T without having those ""video game"" moments of downtime you would basically be left with tragedy after tragedy after tragedy for 8+ hours with no breaks. This was a perfect example of how to make a change to a story so that the overarching impact to the plot remains the same while injecting a much needed dose of hope and happiness into the story.

If you're upset that they took their foot off the angst and agony gas pedal for one episode the next episode or two are some of the most intense and emotional parts of the entire game so you'll definitely get your fill of misery."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,It was just a great episode. In about 45 they managed to make me really care about two characters and their relationship. There are a lot of shows out there that fail to do that in an ark over 22 episodes.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,This episode will go down for me as one of Offermans most brilliant performances and the benefit of the doubt for this show and its path
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I really liked Bill's line ""this is not the tragic suicide at the end of the play"", as a subtle ribbing of the game's more tropey grimdark aspects."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"If you gonna change stuff, do it proper. 

And they did it proper. Beautiful episode. And practical. No need to bring up dead person in future episodes or seasons, while giving a desirable impact on character progression. 

And no I am not crying, I got spore in my eyes."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Honestly, Bill is the only happy ending in this whole story now."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"That little giggle-cry when he ate that strawberry, though. Masterful acting right there. With Frank just beaming at him. The whole damn thing was ridiculously romantic. I ugly cried."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Every actor in this series deserves a goddamn Emmy. Best performance I‚Äôve ever seen from Nick Offerman. Jesus Christ that man can act! Shout out to Murray Bartlett too!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"This episode absolutely blew me away.

The acting by these men was just astonishing.

What they accomplished in like 30 some minutes is probably the most moving tv I have ever seen."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,They are killing it with the series so far. So much love and attention to detail in every scene. Sunday can't come soon enough.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Probably the only viewer who DID NOT sob by the end of the show ONLY because I saw Bill and Franks story as the happiest outcome one can expect for surviving the apocalypse. A pure win in terms of the hellish reality they live in, having a home and warmth of a partner and to build something together and thrive for a while. 

They were incredibly fortunate and the writers did an amazing job presenting this beautifully."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"That episode was incredible. Within 1 episode, we meet characters and are crying in the end from what happens to them. Such incredible writing and acting.

As someone who hasn't played the game, can someone explain where we are in the game relative to the end? I'm trying to get an idea of the pacing and how many seasons we should expect from this show."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"This was a perfect way to add it to the series. With all the hopelessness of the series, we got one episode where despite how hopeless things were, we had two characters that prospered through the apocalypse. 

Nick Offerman deserves an award for that performance."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"That was the tightest one hour romance story I‚Äôve ever seen-  perfect notes hit- from the untrusting gruff man- to a trusting one guy gruff man- sometimes that‚Äôs all the needle moves- Ron Swanson- was excellent- he didn‚Äôt radically change- he just changed from a man who protected himself- to a man that protected someone else- and as he said that gave him purpose.  I believe many men feel in there heart that they want to protect those around them- and that means not being vulnerable and being pragmatic stoic- and he pulled that off while showing a tremendous amount of appreciation to his partner albeit in a way only his partner would understand.  

I think the strawberry scene where his partner does something ron can‚Äôt do- really drives the nail home- through communication and trust with Tess his partner got him something he couldn‚Äôt build- a strawberry in a dying world. 

Often times gruff individualists end up with a social partner forcing relationships with others- and the other person came to see the value in his partners way of building relationships for them.  When Joel shows up- he tries to convey that about Tess- who Joel couldn‚Äôt protect- and now he sees the ghost of Tess and his daughter in Ellie.  Will Joel learn to see the value in his new friend?  We will see."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Not today, you new world order jackboot fucks!"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Great episode of television but man, but Bill standing in the middle of the open street at night shooting the raiders pissed me off though."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Loved everything about it but as a gay man who loves horror Sci fi, gay films and hairy older men, this episode was literal Crack for me. 

It was so heart wrenching I was ugly crying. They always get me with the progressive string music a la Six Feet Under. 

Amazing episode, I can't wait for more of the last of us. And these two super daddies were hot as hell and utterly captivating. 

10 10 10s across"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Someone make an essay on how to properly adapt material to TV and where to/how to make good changes to the story while still keeping the fundamental character growth of the source material based on this episode and send it to Lauren Hissrich.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"It was a very good episode.

I still think if they spun how the story went in the game slightly differently  it would have been as good.

Theres tragedy in both stories, I dont suppose it really matters which one they went with."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I'll just note for the record that this episode-- and the reactions it's getting from people who may have, for the first time, seen a depiction of two men in a committed romantic relationship-- is a great example of what representation can do.

Tell me that there aren't people who watched this who were brought to tears by the two characters (and the actors portraying them) and who had, in the past, either never thought about a non-heterosexual relationship or were actively anti- such things.

So you show this beautiful episode of TV. This is the kind of thing that people are talking about when they talk about how representation is so important."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"It's really great how they evolved the source material, and I'm fine with it because it's so well fucking executed in understanding the games message and paying it respect. Not just deviating for the sake or ease of it. 

I think I'm easier on the show for deviating than I am for other adaptions because the game is already incredibly cinematic. So I can shrug off missing good game moments like Joel getting caught in Bill's trap for example. Because I've essentially already seen it cinematically, it's not like its adapting it from a book where all I had to go off was description and my own imagination.

Bill knew how to survive, but Frank knew how to live, and tying that into Joel's arc was so wonderfully done. And if this depressing but ultimately wholesome episode is one of the happy ones. Henry and Sam will break me lol"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Such a great episode. I was waiting for something horrible to happen to one of them the whole time. The ending was beautiful. I bawled my eyes out.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"Literally the only thing I disliked in this episode is when the raiders attacked... Like c'mon man, standing out in the middle of the street, in the open, on a dark, rainy night? You could have been in cover and iced everyone without them ever seeing you."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,It's going to get crazy in the next episode!
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,It was extremely well done and he makes a great point about being able to expand on the story because the gameplay and mechanic tutorials don't require Bill to assist Joel while the player is still learning how to properly position ladders or use items opened up by the tool bench.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"I thought it was a really sweet episode. The world of The Last of Us is fucking brutal and unforgiving at the best of times. Seeing Bill and Frank have a somewhat happy ending was a rare change of pace for that world. 

I would have liked to see Bill help Joel fight through the school like in the game, but that would have only been like 10-15 minutes of an 80 minutes episode. This way we still got to see Bill do what he does best, and get to see him happy too.

If anything I think it will get people's hopes up for the rest of the series. People who don't know the games are probably thinking that there can be a happier ending now. But those who have played know full well the gut punches that are coming...

Plus any amount of Nick Offerman is aces in my book"
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I‚Äôm straight as an arrow and this was a beautifully told piece of TV. I would‚Äôve like to see him chat or interact with Joel a little bit more. But maybe in flashbacks. That was honestly some of the best TV I‚Äôve watched in a very long time.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,Nice let's just openly post spoilers.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,I think it was a good change. I really enjoyed episode 3.
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,"What a beautiful episode with stellar writing. With that being said, I have a very very small nitpick about this episode. I think many of the complaints about it being a ‚Äúfiller‚Äù episode or too much of a sidetrack could have been mitigated by interjecting a few scenes of Joel and Ellie making their way there in between the Bill and Frank scenes to make it seem as if they were still alive when they arrive only to find their bodies as a voice over of Ellie reading the note played over their final scene. Does that make sense? But I‚Äôm still loving the show so far and not hating on it at all."
The Wild Adventures of Blinky Bill,i loved their first argument. nazis run the government!! also anyone catch movie details in the shots inside his bunker? wondering if there were any cooking books next to guns and ammo lol
Teachers,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
Teachers,The visual of Joel‚Äôs wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.
Teachers,"I like how Troy Baker is listed as Video Game ""Joel"" in the BTS after the episode"
Teachers,there is 100% a very bad reason why david was a teacher before the outbreak
Teachers,"I do like how at first it seemed like they only ate the one guy who died, but then joel finds the whole room full of bodies. so they been at this a while"
Teachers,[removed]
Teachers,Always wondered how a video game actor as good as Troy Baker would do as a live action actor. The answer is good
Teachers,So was the implication that they were eating the girl‚Äôs father in the dining hall? (Among many other people evidently)
Teachers,"""It's okay, I believe him."" 

So badass and so chilling at the same time."
Teachers,That grown man just slapped a little orphan girl in the face and then fed her her father. Eric Cartman would be proud.
Teachers,[removed]
Teachers,the meat from the soup isn't venison is it...
Teachers,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
Teachers,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
Teachers,‚ÄúI made you eat your parents‚Äù
Teachers,the actor for david did a great job
Teachers,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
Teachers,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
Teachers,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
Teachers,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
Teachers,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‚Äòown‚Äô her as his pet at his side. I‚Äôd recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
Teachers,"I‚Äôm seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
Teachers,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
Teachers,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
Teachers,"""Baby girl"" ü•∫ 

Gonna go weep brb"
Teachers,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
Teachers,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
Teachers,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
Teachers,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
Teachers,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
Teachers,"Indicative of David‚Äôs character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else‚Äôs

Edit - 4x‚Äôs the cannibalism"
Teachers,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
Teachers,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
Teachers,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
Teachers,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
Teachers,[removed]
Teachers,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
Teachers,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, ‚Äúbaby girl.‚Äù"
Teachers,I‚Äôd nit pick Joel‚Äôs recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn‚Äôt so fucking awesome
Teachers,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I‚Äôd expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
Teachers,"""I believe  him"""
Teachers,100% that kid‚Äôs dad was the ear
Teachers,Oh yeah. That‚Äôs that shit I like right there
Teachers,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
Teachers,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
Teachers,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
Teachers,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
Teachers,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
Teachers,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season üò¨"
Teachers,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
Teachers,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn‚Äôt others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
Teachers,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay baby girl‚Äù was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, ‚ÄúIn an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.‚Äù And damn if Joel and Ellie aren‚Äôt stainless steel survivors."
Teachers,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
Teachers,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
Teachers,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I‚Äôd just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
Teachers,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
Teachers,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
Teachers,I counted 22 stabs‚Ä¶damn Ellie
Teachers,Great episode overall. I wish they could‚Äôve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
Teachers,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
Teachers,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
Teachers,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn‚Äôt still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind üò≥
Teachers,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
Teachers,If you‚Äôre gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
Teachers,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
Teachers,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
Teachers,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
Teachers,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
Teachers,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
Teachers,"I‚Äôm curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
Teachers,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
Teachers,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
Teachers,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
Teachers,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
Teachers,[removed]
Teachers,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
Teachers,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
Teachers,Ellie‚Äôs screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
Teachers,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
Teachers,"As someone who‚Äôs never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It‚Äôs hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I‚Äôve seen in ages, and am loving it."
Teachers,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
Teachers,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
Teachers,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
Teachers,That went by so fast
Teachers,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
Teachers,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
Teachers,Pretty faithful to the game. Wish that David would have said the line of how is he supposed to explain his broken finger to everyone else. Then Ellie introduces herself.
Teachers,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
Teachers,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
Teachers,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
Teachers,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
Teachers,"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay baby girl, I got you‚Äù I AM NOT OK"
Teachers,"Holy fuck that episode was intense. There were so many incredible lines of dialogue in this episode too.

The final scene with Ellie in the dining hall literally had my jaw dropped. The emotion Bella showed as she killed the cannibal rapist preacher was next level. What an incredible actress.

I love how this show doesn't linger on side characters. They introduce them, somehow make us invested in just a few minutes and then move on. They don't spend half a season stuck in one QZ. They don't draw out things like Joel coming back from the stabbing. I absolutely love that about this show."
Teachers,"the biggest twist from david for me its not that he is cannibal or creep r-----. But that he actually worship cordyceps all along, its his God, find god after apocalypse, etc."
Teachers,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
Teachers,Fuck.
Teachers,"Jesus, that was intense"
Teachers,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
Teachers,"I thought it was weird that the fire did absolutely nothing the entire last scene.  Neither of the characters acted like there was a fire and they had a lot of fire cutaways like it was building to something.  After she got out I expected the fire to attract colonists, but they just walked away.  If everything was on fire just for the vibes I think it was done badly."
Teachers,"I love that they focus on the more human element of these situations, it‚Äôs really a character driven program and you can‚Äôt have as much action as the game since it wouldn‚Äôt be realistic.

But damn after Joel dropped that ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I believe him‚Äù line and just murdered the other dude, I‚Äôm not going to deny that I‚Äôd love to see more of Joel just being a badass out here."

Havent You Heard? Im Sakamoto,"So, I really love Doctor Who. The show has definitely had its ups and downs, natural for any franchise approaching 60 years old, but even at its worst I've always found it fun to watch.

This applies to Classic Who as well, where let us say ""The spirit was willing but the budget was weak"". The sets may have been cardboard, and the monsters may have been bubble wrap ([literally on one occasion](https://imgur.com/a/WTnPvxH)) but the show usually made up for it with a witty script and good performances.

That's the point of this lengthy preamble: Classic Who was cheap and silly, but usually well written and performed. I need to establish that, because I know a lot of youngsters only know Modern Who, and what I'm about to do is the equivalent of delivering someone's eulogy and talking only about the time they crapped themselves in public.

Havent You Heard? Im Sakamoto,"I quit watching Eureka on SyFy halfway through the 3rd season because the product placement expanded from laptops and coke bottles in the background to major plot devices that would have several minutes of dialogue devoted to it. 

The two most egregious examples that come to mind were the time that all the major characters left the diner and one of them starts oohing and aahing over the cop's new car. The show then grinds to a halt for two minutes so that they can all stand in a semicircle around the car complimenting it's aggressive lines and superb aerodynamics while the cop launches into a full fledged commercial, ""oh yeah, that's my all new 2009 Subaru Outback! 250 horsepower with all-wheel drive standard! Most backseat legroom in its class!"" (*this is a fictional town full of comic-book-level super geniuses with flying cars and personal teleporters*)

A Sisters All You Need,THANK YOU. I hate him SO MUCH.
A Sisters All You Need,"This guy is my most hated fictional character and it's not even close. I've never had to actually pause anything out of visceral anger until I watched Bad Sisters.

I think it helps that he's so... mundane? He's obviously evil, but he's not an outright maniac. He feels like a real person you want to punch in the face."
A Sisters All You Need,Absolutely love the bad guy. Such a great performance.
A Sisters All You Need,I enjoyed it.  Not sure what they're going to do for season two.
A Sisters All You Need,It was renewed for a reason.
A Sisters All You Need,JP is literally one of the most sadistic fictional characters of all time. Like he's up there with Nurse Ratched or Joffrey.
A Sisters All You Need,r/BadSistersAppleTVplus
A Sisters All You Need,"Simply a great show, too. I thoroughly enjoyed it while it was airing and have been surprised how many random things from it have popped into my head here and there ‚Äî really has some memorable elements to it."
A Sisters All You Need,I loved season 1.
A Sisters All You Need,">But now I must say I have never despised a villain more than Claes Bang.

I've never made it past episode 3 because of him. At that point, for me, the thought of being confronted with that character again was met with heavy psychological resistance. I want to try again soon, though."
A Sisters All You Need,No
A Sisters All You Need,"What?? I had no idea they renewed it for a second season! It was planned as a limited series and I recall one of the actors saying that in an interview. But yes I agree, I think the ending was perfect and doesn‚Äôt really need a second season."

A Sisters All You Need,"I absolutely loved the 1st season, and the 2nd was fantastic too. Might be because I was binging it over a few days while sick, but by the end of the 3rd I was so over it. Relentless ""something's gone wrong"" and race to fix it every episode, becoming more and more outlandish, just really numbed me to all the characters. 

I checked the IMDB scores to see if it was just me, and actually it looks like it is. If anything the scores were maybe a bit higher in S3. 

Interested to know if it is just me being a grump or if anyone else ended the series feeling that way?"
A Sisters All You Need,Michael Dorman absolutely kills in this.
A Sisters All You Need,"It was good for a season, but then it just turned into a very average tv drama‚Ä¶but in space."
A Sisters All You Need,"More people shouldn't. 

It was a really great show in the first season. But even by the end of the first season the show started going off the rail, for no discernable reason, with Karen's affair plotline. Later seasons the Karen drama kept going on and on it just overshadowed every thing. 

The worst part of the show is how petty they made the space race out to be. Aside from the magnificent space shots and the typical star-trek-esqe score, they have never once made a case of why the space race needs to continue aside from a petty US vs. USSR rivalry for propaganda reason. It was the opposite of For All Mankind."
A Sisters All You Need,The latest season with the kid going thru some kind of psychotic episode was unbearable.
A Sisters All You Need,"The drama got to be unbearably cringe for me. I finished the second season, but I'm done with it."

A Sisters All You Need,"No.  More people do not need to watch every ""underrated"" show or movie because some self-annointed critic thinks so.

If the producers wanted a bigger audience, they'd produce better content, be more inclusive, create more episodes, & advertise more fiercely.  The producers have chosen not to do so.  

I've watched the show, and while it's entertaining, it's no ""gem""."
A Sisters All You Need,Most underrated?? That's like the most popular sci-fi of the last few years after The Expanse got cancelled
A Sisters All You Need,No thanks
A Sisters All You Need,If reddit calls it a Gem then it probably isn't one
A Sisters All You Need,You can probably save yourself the trouble as watch the first season only. Imo it's not very good after. Season 3 especially
A Sisters All You Need,I trying but the first season is so damn boring
A Sisters All You Need,It‚Äôs awful
A Sisters All You Need,"It‚Äôs well done, but the pacing is too slow for my taste. But I‚Äôm only early in Season 2, so the jury is still out."
A Sisters All You Need,"Anytime I see "" everyone needs to watch this or blah blah"" it screams viral marketing. Apple needs to do real marketing and understand that a lot of what they are putting out. Is an uppity slow burn and most people don't like that. Critics may, uppity trust fund babies will slobber over it. The rest of us will go that s neat but not actually sub. If you are wondering why you will mpre of these articles. Its because Apple TV is bleeding money at a rate they didnt even expect. Investors are not happy and the vast majority of subs. Come from the free ones."

A Sisters All You Need,Good lord. No show has dropped off as bad as this did in season 3.

A Sisters All You Need,I watched two episodes and I couldn‚Äôt get into it. And while I‚Äôm waiting for Servant and yellow jackets
A Sisters All You Need,No one ‚Äúneeds‚Äù to watch it.
A Sisters All You Need,I would say it's probably a tad over rated. The end of season 2 was claimed to be best TV of recent few years but in reality it was far from that and I didn't find S2 that enjoyable as I wished. Haven't even started season 3 but heard quality takes a dip.
A Sisters All You Need,I'm not interested in paying for another goddamn streaming service and device just for one show.

A Sisters All You Need,"I tried watching this show with my wife. It's an intriguing concept. But it got so bogged down in boring human drama that we never got past three episodes.

It felt like a very boring version of Mad Men with some NASA stuff in the mix."
A Sisters All You Need,"The corporate-style chanting, and the weird plot holes, at the beginning of the second season had me quit."
A Sisters All You Need,It started well in season one/two. Season four was pretty garbage.
A Sisters All You Need,Yeah I don't know about that. It is a HIGHLY melodramatic and soapy show that is mainly focused on various forms of human drama that have nothing to do with space exploration. The writing is simply not that good. It's an interesting premise but I think the execution is rather middling. Only watch if you have a tremendous amount of patience for soapyness.
A Sisters All You Need,Love it
A Sisters All You Need,Except that ‚Äúone storyline.‚Äù
A Sisters All You Need,This show is actually pretty bad. I stopped watching at some point in season 2.
A Sisters All You Need,Love the show. But I think we‚Äôve got some timeline issues going on - if Ed was a 20 YO pilot in the Korean War (1950 - very young ) wouldn‚Äôt he 60+ on the Mars mission? Same with most of the other characters.
A Sisters All You Need,It‚Äôs on Apple+‚Ä¶ not for me!
A Sisters All You Need,"I tried watching this show, and everyone's motivation was just American chest thumping, ""Har-Har, For Murica"". I just felt it was 50s American propaganda with how the characters behave and couldn't get into it at all."
A Sisters All You Need,It's the most overrated show.  It's just a soap with adults act like 15 year olds with a space theme. Also they made it look that Van Braun was the only Nazi at NASA. There where way more.
A Sisters All You Need,"The first season was really good, but oh my god was this last one bad. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the actors or the writers but everything felt so shallow and forced."
A Sisters All You Need,"It gets real soapy at times, but the space stuff has some of the most thrilling heroics this side og The Expanse (with which it shares a certain kinship)."
A Sisters All You Need,If I could have an edit of just the space stuff it would be perfect for me. I tolerate the junk for the amazing alternative history dream.
A Sisters All You Need,I started it and stopped it . Was really boring.
A Sisters All You Need,"I strongly disliked it. Stupid as hell premise which I really couldn't buy, and the show became stupider as it went on. No thanks"
A Sisters All You Need,"The show just isn't good, the whole Space is good fucked up by sub par melodrama that shouldn't be in the show"
A Sisters All You Need,"No they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs really dull."
A Sisters All You Need,This show sucks ass. Straight up no character development at all. This is the gay astronaut. This one‚Äôs black. This one is strong guy. This one is emotional. They‚Äôre all the same exact characters as when you first see them.
A Sisters All You Need,"Eh, it‚Äôs pretty boring IMO"

The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true.

Definitely members would manipulate to ‚Äúevangelize‚Äù people. It‚Äôs flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a ‚Äúdevil‚Äù to bring down the ‚Äúwill of God‚Äù. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."

Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn‚Äôt want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn‚Äôt true - it‚Äôs disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn‚Äôt see anyone else mention it."

Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.

Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,Reminds me of ‚Äúsilenced‚Äù about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
Exposed: The Case Of Keli Lane,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."

KENGAN ASHURA,Animation looks like shit but I'll probably give it a try anyway since I liked the manga. Maybe if its successful they will decide to adapt Yabako Sandrovich's other work like Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru.
KENGAN ASHURA,Why does Netflix make such shitty animation
KENGAN ASHURA,If they want to adapt a fighting manga why not holyland? I have yet to come across a better one.
KENGAN ASHURA,"Looks terrible to me, but maybe the target demographic likes it."
KENGAN ASHURA,"Man, I'm probably alone here, but I do not understand everyone's automatic aversion to anything that is CGI. I thought it actually looked kinda cool- like a video game almost. To me, the dialogue and sound design are what made this whole thing kind of off-putting."
KENGAN ASHURA,"Sorry but this looks absolutely atrocious.  


All of the impact the original artstyle conveyed is totally lost in this cheap CGI rendition."
KENGAN ASHURA,Seems to be that I‚Äôm paying ¬£8 a month for Netflix and all they are bringing out is fucking god awful anime
KENGAN ASHURA,Right? Cgi is almost never a good idea
KENGAN ASHURA,The (I think) main character even looks like Baki.

KENGAN ASHURA,Awesome. Time to celebrate by hitting the gym.
KENGAN ASHURA,"Well that‚Äôs only because of the way Japanese animation companies work. Netflix wouldn‚Äôt need deadlines like that. They could take their time. Look at castlevania (yea yea I know, technically not an anime). Wouldn‚Äôt need slave labor either. Get a good team and let them work just like any animated show. Unless you are being sarcastic then I‚Äôll accept me being dumb haha."
KENGAN ASHURA,"Hell even in the recent Dragon Ball movies, the shift from the 2D animation to CGI randomly throughout the movies is so fucking jarring it takes me right out of the scene as it‚Äôs literally all I can think about whenever it happens."

The former, what's that about?"
KENGAN ASHURA,Castlevania took a long long time for barely any episodes
KENGAN ASHURA,"This synopsis is from Wikipedia:

‚ÄòLand of the Lustrous is set in the far future, in a land inhabited by an immortal life form called the Lustrous, who are the embodiment of gemstones. The twenty-eight Lustrous are led by their teacher, Kongo, and fight to defend themselves against the Lunarians, who appear every few days, seeking to harvest the Lustrous' bodies for decorations. 

Phosphophyllite, nicknamed Phos, currently 300 years old, is the youngest of the Lustrous, and is because of their brittleness unable to fight. They feel useless, but are given the task to assemble a natural history by Kongo. While looking for information to include in the book, Phos meets the nightwatch, Cinnabar, who is poisonous and thus dangerous even to other Lustrous, and therefore lives in isolation. Finding this sad, Phos decides to find Cinnabar a better job.‚Äô

Also, here‚Äôs a trailer so you can see what the show looks like:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nZF4fJrPMC8"
KENGAN ASHURA,Yes. As in no slave labor or crunch deadlines haha. Then a a year later they released a new season with double the episodes. Case in point they can do actual animation but they are choosing to do shitty CGI anime. I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt wanna sound like a dickhead but what are you arguing?
KENGAN ASHURA,"3D CGI ,no thank you."
KENGAN ASHURA,"On one hand, it 3D CGI having same issue rest of such shows suffer from: 12 fps stuttering animation. 

On the other hand though, the movements look a lot less robotic, aka, doesn't look as if I am moving a stickman toy. And the facial expressions are on point. So, I am looking forward to it.

Hopefully they take some cues from Land of the Lustrous and use the CGI to its advantage, like creative camera angles,etc."
KENGAN ASHURA,NETFLIX IS DOING KENGAN? Oooooooooo boy 
KENGAN ASHURA,"The manga that this series is based on is amazing, it's a real shame that it got stuck with shitty CGI for the anime"
KENGAN ASHURA,"The 3D will make this bad and the manga for this is decent.

I guess thats why they didn't want to give this thing any budget."
KENGAN ASHURA,Seeing this in CG is making me cry because I had heard a lot of good things about the manga. Fingers crossed that the CG will be good
KENGAN ASHURA,"CGI animation just takes the emotion out of it.  Everything becomes all rigid and predictable.  There's no artistry about it.  I can see why Miyazaki is upset with the state of animation nowadays.


Netflix should be looking at Castlevania and trying to recreate what made that popular; good writing, excellent animation, and great music."
KENGAN ASHURA,"> the facial expressions are on point.

Were we watching the same thing? I thought they looked utterly ridiculous."
KENGAN ASHURA,"While I understand the notion against the CGI anime, as I suggested above, watch Land of the Lustrous. It was beautiful **because** of CGI, not despite of CGI. It proves you wrong in the elements you mentioned, the emotions, fluidity and unpredictable.

Twelve Forever,Says it doesn't exist.
Twelve Forever,"That's more than some people have. You actually have a good starting point. I would suggest creating a show Bible. That just means it consists of mostly written information including: character biographies, plot outline, possible episode outlines, and a script of at least the pilot episode. Show Bibles usually don't include any drawings. Then once you feel comfortable about the amount of information you've put together, get a quick copywrite on it (only $25) then start submitting it to cartoon production studios that welcome unsolicited work such as Frederator studios. If you're having trouble about what to put in the show Bible, do a quick Google search. Most of the time there are at least a good 10 websites that have outlines or examples to follow. Hope that helps if you really are inspired to give your show a go."

Twelve Forever,"Steven Universe is an interesting case because the show itself has reached IDGAF levels of queerness, but CN actively downplays this in the marketing. 

Hell, the network's official line is the gems are ""genderless"" (implication: so it's not gay!) despite the fact they all present as female, use feminine pronouns, and are played by female voice actors.

Twelve Forever,"Yea, I'm keeping an eye on that subreddit every now and then. Really hope he's there for that specific show. "
Twelve Forever,"There are a number of other factors leading us to think this to be the case actually. But the creator seemingly being back at Cartoon Network is actually pretty good evidence, considering he initially left with the crew that did Regular Show to work on the new show Close Enough, which looks to be basically what RS would've been without CN's limitations. He confirmed that he left this project fairly early, and his recent posts imply he's been a CN since then. "
Twelve Forever,"I mean, they ARE genderless. They come from a species with no concept of gender. Rebecca Sugar said so herself."
Twelve Forever,"the regular show crew didn't really leave CN. Close Enough, despite being a TBS show, is produced by Cartoon Network Studios."
Twelve Forever,"Exactly what I'm talking about. Rebecca Sugar's interviews are part of the marketing, and this talking point directly contradicts what's portrayed in the show.

We don't see gems voiced by male actors. We don't see them drawn with beards, male-pattern baldness, or Adam's apples. There is a conscious choice to represent them using femme visual cues like ""ballerina"" and ""Blaxploitation heroine.""  They're even explicitly referred to as [women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT13ijUfSts) on multiple occasions.

So while they are from a mono-gender race, calling them genderless is a real stretch. And while they may not grasp a lot of our cultural baggage related to gender, they understand the concept enough to correctly use pronouns and other gendered words (like ""mother"").

[This comic](https://images7.memedroid.com/images/UPLOADED195/55adc166f3619.jpeg) pretty much sums it up."

I'm always ready to listen, I'm trying to refine my concepts so they are more understandable... I think you can help, especially if you think that only *most* of it doesn't make any sense

I also can try to clear up some of my intentions, if it helps

> I genuinely think you need to talk to a professional,

Are you rushing to some judge contest? There's no rush to judge

I don't like when the dialogue is based on spouting judgements instead of asking questions and getting information ‚Äî I think it's ineffective and harmful for both speakers

I think asking before judging is actually a lot easier and kinder when you get used to it

You want to go the easier road (jump to judgement immediately) but often end up on the harder road (because you couldn't stop yourself from unnecessary judgement)

And you don't have to end every thought in a judgement

You didn't ask, but here's some constructive info related to your judgement: not all of my posts are like this, not all of my posts are (were?) received like this, I'm not a lonely person... and currently I'm more worried about my physical health, especially vision

[Visual snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow), [Photopsia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsia)

And it's always pleasure for me to talk to anybody if it's a ""real"" dialogue

Yes, the posts like this are messy... I fear if this post is more confusing than my previous posts about speech, I fear if the key idea (about different ""levels"") is unclear and stops understanding completely... if it is so I probably won't be able make those posts understandable whatever I do (otherwise I can make posts shorter, explain more, define more or write for a different fandom and etc.)

If the core idea fails to be understood it would mean this is the ""end"" (fail) of such posts

But somebody still likes it I see so there's hope for me

The other thing I fear if I'm sacrificing my health for this (working too much and being called a madman ) -- it gets on my nerves a bit and affects my eyes too

Not just that, but the thought that I might fail (I want to make this idea about ""patterns"" known)

You or anybody are always welcome if you want to talk or something"

Twelve Forever,"Okay, asking questions instead of rushing to judgement then: 

Why? Why did you do a long and detailed analysis of certain lines from Gravity Falls characters? I've read it multiple times and while I understand it, I'm not sure what useful information it's conveying. 

Many of your connectors, like 'in a broader context' or 'logically connected', are just so broad they can be used for almost any character.   You're describing certain sentences characters say, but I'm not getting anything meaningful from this about speech patterns, the show, or anything else."
Twelve Forever,"Thank you for answering like this and giving information (feedback)!

> Why? Why did you do a long and detailed analysis of certain lines from Gravity Falls characters? I've read it multiple times and while I understand it, I'm not sure what useful information it's conveying. 

I think those patterns are universal. So while I'm writing for Gravity Falls I'm preparing something for other fiction...

I do those posts because I want to create & popularize concepts that could be applied to speech, maybe to speech of real people too...

Also those ""patterns"" for me are only crude descriptions of some simpler things... I see those things not as patterns, but as simple [""shapes""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOjFcx3GJHg) or even simple objects of experience (that's why I believe in them)

an analogy: (2,6)(7,6)(7,1)(2,1) - is it immediately clear what this jumble of numbers is? But that's just a simple shape of a square when you're used to the idea of notation coordinates

Thank you very much for letting me know that what I wrote isn't completely unclear

> Many of your connectors, like 'in a broader context' or 'logically connected', are just so broad they can be used for almost any character. You're describing certain sentences characters say, but I'm not getting anything meaningful from this about speech patterns, the show, or anything else.

Twelve Forever,Interestingly I had never heard of those and they were by the same woman that's no longer with us: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jacobson
Twelve Forever,"Especially now that Filmstruck is gone, I'm glad that TCM is still occasionally running stuff like this."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"John Marsden is legend. 

Shame my brother made me read ""The Great Gatenby"" first."
Tomorrow When the War Began,I'd prefer a sequel to the movie 
Tomorrow When the War Began,Think it should've been on normal ABC TV rather than ABC 3. Hopefully it gets better though.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Never even heard of this thanks.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I saw this movie. It was very good, and I highly recommend it. I hope I get a chance to see this series."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Loved the books as a kid but now just praying they don't mess it up like the super hard to find movie. 
Tomorrow When the War Began,Will this air in the US? I've seen the movie and loved it. 
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I didn't mind the movie, apart from one or two performances, it was generally an okay cast. I'd always presumed they;d combine the second and third books into a single movie though as not too much happens which would be good for film in the second book.

"
Tomorrow When the War Began,This has started? Will have to go onto iView tomorrow. 
Tomorrow When the War Began,Reposted to /r/discovertv 
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I'll be honest - just watched the ep on iview and wanted to love it but it's fucking awful. Why even bother, they've obviously spent some money but fuck knows why. Terrible script, it looks good by why are they running around for 10 minutes with shots of Homer wearing a fedora and messenger satchel going from calm-panic-calm-panic again over and over?"
Tomorrow When the War Began,Have watched two episodes of the series so far. Really does benefit from having more time to develop the characters. The parents of the main characters have screen time as does the commander of the local enemy forces. I keep thinking about continuity issues in regards to where they are moving plots points in from future books so it is not the best way to watch it. 
Tomorrow When the War Began,Not sure about the show but I like the music choices.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I was OBSESSED with that series of books! I used to think about what I should do ""if the russians comes""  :D"
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Lol as a bored teenage boy I loved ""The Great Gatenby"" probably one of the first of Marsden's books I read.

In saying that at that time I had no idea about ""The Great Gatsby"""
Tomorrow When the War Began,I wouldn't. I personally found the movie horrible.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Agreed. The Producer has said this created ""challenges"" for how to depict the danger the kids were in. If they had it on ABC it could've been rated for adults or older teens and clearly been a better representation of the books.

Only one episode out so far, of course. It was passable but I hope it gets better."
Tomorrow When the War Began,the movie was only the first book right?
Tomorrow When the War Began,"It is on multiple netflix regions.
https://flixsearch.io/movie/tomorrow-when-the-war-began-2011
(drop down list with all countries a bit further down the page from the flags)"
Tomorrow When the War Began,Really? I feel the exact opposite. Just finished and loved it. The scene with Lee's mother and Ellis's mum screaming at her to run had me in tears. The filler stuff at the start wasn't the best but they had to set it up somehow 
Tomorrow When the War Began,The show is about 100x worse. It's a kick in the guts.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I didn't even know this was based on a book series. I don't think it was released in the U.S.  I happened to catch the movie on Netflix, because it got a good rating. AFAIK, the movie never got released in U.S. theaters."
Tomorrow When the War Began,I dont have Netflix.
Tomorrow When the War Began,That issue can be easily resolved.
Tomorrow When the War Began,They have a free trial.
Tomorrow When the War Began,#I'M BUENOS ARIES AND I SAY KILL 'EM ALL
Tomorrow When the War Began,I started reading the books and am on the second now. I can't wait to see it translated on the screen
Tomorrow When the War Began,\#erinwrightwasright
Tomorrow When the War Began,[deleted]
Tomorrow When the War Began,One thing I don't like about the show vs the books is that they cut down just how big space is to make things more exciting. This scene is a good example of this. In the books it can take minutes or even hours for ship to ship weapons to each their targets. But in this scene you've got railguns shooting projectiles across the solar system faster than the speed of light.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Oh jeez, another Expanse thread."
Tomorrow When the War Began,[deleted]
Tomorrow When the War Began,Starship troopers!
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Hi Buenos Aries, I'm dad."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Having read the first three in my opinion they do a very a good job. Especially with the end of the first book.  I was pretty nervous how well they would do with that but don't see how it could be done better.  Of course they do make changes here and there but I feel it works for the most part.  My biggest gripe is over something relatively small
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Your comment reads like someone who hasn't watched the show because they do do those things, throughout the entire series, including in regards to the nuke hitting South America.  Hell, you don't even seem to grasp that the nuke was only fired because the UN preemptively attacked the Mars first strike system since you're talking like it was an unprovoked Martian attack that is never taken seriously by Earth, which is objectively wrong on all counts."
Tomorrow When the War Began,[deleted]
Tomorrow When the War Began,"The two million civilians got killed because earth launched a first strike, when you piss into the wind you don't get to complain about getting soaked."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Why are you even talking about a show that's obvious you've never seen?
Tomorrow When the War Began,Nothing is breaking the speed of light or shooting across the solar system here. The rail guns are shooting at Martian stealth ships/missile platforms stationed near Earth for first strike capability. Think of it like a nuclear sub running silent in an enemy nation's home waters.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Is this sub really that full of clips from it? Not that I've seen.

Anyway, if you wanna talk about getting flooded with clip posts from the same shows, you should subscribe to r/anime lul"
Tomorrow When the War Began,Battle star galactica disagrees with you
Tomorrow When the War Began,"That's an overstatement. If you'd said ""last 20 years"", you'd have a much better case."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Hmmm yeah... exactly what I thought... this season will surprise a lot of people I think...
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Are you telling me that the glowing orange ball in the middle of the map is not the sun? It takes ~8 minutes for light to travel from the sun and at least one of those railgun shots seems to do double that in less than 8 minutes. Even if the orange orb in the middle was Mars that's still a 3 minute journey at the speed of light. There's no way a rail gun gets up to even 0.5C without protomolecule tech.

This isn't the first time the show has been careless with how big space is. Alex's slingshot manoeuvre is the other big one. The real shame is they could have made the scene so much cooler if they had used realistic flight speeds. You split the scene into 3 parts at the start, middle and end of the episode, each part being the initial launch, the destruction of the ships and the impact on Earth. You then have the Secretary General be calm and collected in the first seen, in the second he's looking a little worse for wear after hours of stress and in the final scene you see him really not put together after so long worrying about the return missile."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Just pretending BSG doesn't exist? Last 10 years.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"The map is very obviously not to scale. The missile platforms look bigger than Earth.

Anyways, if it bothers you just pretend every cut is a timeskip."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Dark?  Travelers? Discovery? Stranger Things? Fringe? The Mandalorian? Clone Wars? The Orville? Love, Death + Robots? Orphan Black? Dark Matter? 12 Monkeys?   
  
Is The Expanse the *best* sci-fi show of the last 10 years?  Debatable, it's definitely in contention.  Is it the *only* good sci-fi show of the last 10 years?  Hell no."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Scale doesn't matter in this case. It still takes 8 minutes for light to travel one  AU.
Tomorrow When the War Began,I meant that he had an argument if he said in the last 10 years.
Tomorrow When the War Began,I'm saying there is still no argument that it is the only good sci-fi show of the last 10 years.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Until recently, this past decade has been pretty weak for sci-fi TV and there is certainly a case for it being one of the better shows."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Neither of those things were the original statement or your statement.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Neeson:

>‚ÄùNo, I‚Äôm not,‚Äù Neeson said when asked if he‚Äôs interested in returning. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many spinoffs of ‚ÄòStar Wars.‚Äô It‚Äôs diluting it to me, and it‚Äôs taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.‚Äù

>""It was nice to do that little bit with Ewan, after 25 years, 24 years. I appeared in the last episode. I had 2 lines to say, and it was cool and I loved it. But that's it."""
Tomorrow When the War Began,Star Wars is being hurt by lack of direction and mediocrity.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"The only Star Wars spinoff I've liked is Rogue One and Andor. 

Andor was one of those where I couldn't *believe* anyone was able to get the script approved."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I just don't understand why they insist only doing stuff from the start of the clone wars to just after the fall of the empire. Give me some Old Republic stuff like Mandalorian wars, the ancient sith lords, or the creation of the jedi order."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Or maybe it's that the ratio of good to shitty movies/shows is like 1 out of 5 being generous.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Number of spin-offs isn't the problem. Terrible scripts are.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Liam Neesons though‚Ä¶.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Honestly, the last movies were hideous in comparison with the spin offs."
Tomorrow When the War Began,There's different camps of Star Wars fans. Original trilogy vs original 6 vs disney Star Wars
Tomorrow When the War Began,"ITT: Lots of misdirected anger.

The guy is right, and there's nothing wrong with him saying so.

Edit: FYI, if you're writing me a five paragraph essay of fan drivel, I'm not going to read it."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I can see where he's coming from, but when your spinoffs (Mando, Andor) are considered better than the trilogy that recently came out, you gotta get behind what's still making you bank."
Tomorrow When the War Began,They are being hurt from shit stories and terrible writers
Tomorrow When the War Began,"He then closed out the interview by promoting his next film.

#Tooken 8: The Tookening"
Tomorrow When the War Began,"He's not wrong.

It's why DC Comics tried to streamline things for new readers with The New 52, and then Marvel later tried the same thing with Marvel NOW!; when there's too much of something, people get fatigued trying to keep up with everything.

You could always say ""don't watch everything"" but that's not how the brain works."
Tomorrow When the War Began,The ‚Äúmystery‚Äù was taken away with ‚Äúmidiclorians ‚Äú
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Agreed. And he isn't saying all ""spinoffs"" are bad, which would be unsupportable (see: Andor). An overabundance of varying quality, definitely."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I mean I kinda agree 

Mainly if your content isn‚Äôt AAA maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be made 

Like bad batch is great but some episodes are kinda filler and think obi wan and boba Fett shows don‚Äôt need to exist"
Tomorrow When the War Began,He should know. He was a part of the beginning of the end.
Tomorrow When the War Began,He's right.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Andor
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Andor was ten times better than the last 6 movies.

I think it's the opposite.  The terrible movies are ruining the franchise.

Even bobba fett was better than the last few movies."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Wasn't he in the midichlorians Star Wars episode that literally removed the mystery of the force?

And didn't he have that bullshit story line about Anakin?  Ok, just checking."
Tomorrow When the War Began,I agree with him for the most part. Andor was out of this world.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Hes right, but also....

Do another movie where your a grizzled old veteran that has to begrudgingly do one last job or save someone that's in trouble, and in the process you redeem yourself."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Says the guy who did ‚ÄúTaken‚Äù and dozen other  of the same formulaic films of a guy seeking revenge.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"I hate to break it to him, but the prequels diminished the value of the franchise."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Says the guy from: Men in Black International, Daddy‚Äôs Home 2, The Huntsman, Ted 2, Taken 1-2-3, Anchorman 2, Wrath of the Titans, The Chronicles of Narnia, The A-Team, Les Mis, Arthur the King, Excalibur, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a few spinoffs, remakes and sequels. He is well versed in running stories into the ground."
Tomorrow When the War Began,Says the man in the first spinoff.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Bro there‚Äôs too many Liam Neeson movies if anything. Three of them came out last year alone and I bet they were all basically the same
Tomorrow When the War Began,"He's right. I used to really enjoy the movies occasionally. Even saw the prequels in theaters. Then they kept coming, one after the other and every dumb mother fucker in the world is out here trying to act like they are the biggest fan in the world. It got so annoying that I can't enjoy any of that shit anymore"
Tomorrow When the War Began,It‚Äôs become the Empire
Tomorrow When the War Began,I don‚Äôt mind the expanded universe of movies so long as they are not shit and lately the complaint is that the movies and spinoffs have been nothing but social justice shit.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Totally agree
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Yeah, sorry Liam, but nah. Projects like Rogue One, Mandalorian, Bad Batch, and Andor show that there is plenty of time for great stories in this universe. It's not an issue of to much content, but an issue of flying space Mary Poppins cameos of Princess Leia's reanimated corpse and Jar Jar Bigalow ""Mee-sa Senator now"" being regurgitated into the screen. The issue isn't volume, it's quality."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"""Being hurt""?  


No, the damage was done a very long time ago. Now its more like kicking the pulverized remains of a long dead horse"
Tomorrow When the War Began,"people here complaining about diluting star wars, sayin disney is at fault.

meanwhile i was reading these same stories in the 90s, in comic and/or novel form, because the star wars EU existed.

the only difference is now they are turning the stories into live action. hell episode 9, which i greatly dislike, is still very much Dark Empire from the 90s.

Fuck if they dont need to go ahead and make Shadows of the Empire into a live action series.

crime lords vs sith lords. lets go!"
Tomorrow When the War Began,I happen to agree with Mr Neeson on this...
Tomorrow When the War Began,Whatever made Andor happen - keep doing that.  Best Star Wars material out there.
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Stars Wars succumbed to the Marvel-ization effect a while ago. I feel the same way about a new star wars IP as I do a new superhero movie: oh, ok."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù always struck me as a story about Anakin Skywalker and how he turned away from good and then was redeemed by the love of his son. 

That story has been told."
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Well Star Wars fans have proven that they'll watch and like any old crap, so it doesn't really matter."
Tomorrow When the War Began,I agree and also like the some of the spin offs.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Space Jesus isn't wrong
Tomorrow When the War Began,"Think the sequel trilogy did that, mate."
Tomorrow When the War Began,When does Taken 6 come out?
Tomorrow When the War Began,I think it‚Äôs diluting for me that Neeson has made multiple films with the same plot for the last 15 years.
Tomorrow When the War Began,Clearly not a fan of Andor being better than his entire role.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,And then Dexter comes back and does the other kind of ending and people still complain.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,The best way to enjoy a show is to not go to Reddit. So many ‚Äúwriters‚Äù and ‚Äúunderstanders of good writing‚Äù that dwell here. Let a show be a show. I showed dexter to a friend and he had a really good experience with the whole show as a whole. I was surprise. Turns out being in. A sub Reddit with these ‚ÄúI know good writing cause I like good movies‚Äù ruin entertainment.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Game of thrones ending or route to the end came to mind with your opinion above. Once money takeover then perhaps its the end. Series hardly maintain 
quality throughout sometimes the quality dipped but i suppose a reasonable ending is the minimum expectation"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"New Blood series finale was decent imo. It was predictable, but it was not bad. I liked how it ended.

But Dexter's original series finale is the worst episode I've ever watched."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,That finale was so bad. I can objectively describe how it's bad and the people who like it are wrong
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Yeah because the new ending was atrocious and unearned.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"New Blood's ending was 1 of 2 acceptable ending's IMO. Dexter either had to die for his crimes, or get caught and end up in jail. 

The people who complain about New Blood are people that are upset that Dexter was caught because they somehow convinced themselves that Dexter is actually a good person, and not a monster."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,">The people who complain about New Blood are people that are upset that Dexter was caught because they somehow convinced themselves that Dexter is actually a good person, and not a monster.

I just wanna see Michael C. Hall continue to be Dexter haha. I know he's a monster."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Nope. People have written tons about this and that's not why they hate it. The show did not earn the ending it went for whatsoever.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Well that I can understand. But you're in the minority lol- the Dexter sub was filled with straight up delusion at the time of the finale.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Walton Goggins is a national treasure 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"The finale was great, and I loved the show so much I wish it didn't have to end. But that was such a great send off."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I just want to shout out Edi Patterson who stole this season as Gamby's batshit girlfriend. Walton Goggins deserves all the Emmys for this performance.

EDIT: Danny McBride needs to do more directing. The way he framed the fight last week was comic genius."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,That fucking tiger 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,*Just* finished the finale. So damn good. And I really like that Lee didn‚Äôt turn out to be the villain after all and the two rivals truly forged a friendship through all of this.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Man that was a beautiful, great, satisfying, well-rounded finale. In a year of great TV, this show stands above all of them. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,One of my favorite series finales ever for sure.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Great show and an awesome finale. Sad to see that it's over, but excited that McBride has a new project at HBO, and I can't wait to see what's next."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Hopefully Walton and Danny team up again!
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I can see some people not liking the show but that was a great finale. I'm glad they were able to keep their two season vision and not be pressured to keep it going. 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,The level of awesome this show was gives me more hope for McBride's involvement in the new Halloween movie.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"So with Vice Principals, Walton Goggins has been in or involved with  3 of my absolute favorite series finales: This, The Shield(almost), and Justified. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,It was downright fantastic. I'm sad it is over but happy it was here to begin with.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Got into this show thinking, o cool new comedy on HBO

came out with, HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING. Definitely recommend. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"The first season was pretty uneven, but I liked it enough that I wanted to keep watching. When they announced the second season would be the final one, I had a feeling it might be something special. And boy, did they deliver.
Pretty much every issue I had was addressed, the main one being Gamby. Sure, he's always going to be a jerk, but give him some redeeming qualities. McBride found the perfect level of loveable asshole that he knows so well, and it made everything else click into place. Also his relationship with Lee felt way more compelling, glad they were (mostly) not in direct competition for the principal job.

I am also all for these 2-3 season shows. Keeps things fresh and the creative team has no reason to hold back. Looking forward to whatever comes next."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Great show, sad to see it end. Last week's fight scene was hilarious. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"> This isn‚Äôt a simple story of Gamby and Russell learning to trust each other, with Abbott as the eventual villain and Snodgrass as the typical romantic pursuit.

Yes, it absolutely was, and the beauty of the show was that simplicity, which served as a foundation for all the fucked-up, dark-as-hell shit that went down. It was *because* that simple story was always at the core that we could suspend our disbelief that there weren't more dire consequences after all that crazy-ass shit went down."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Honestly I thought there would be more deaths. I liked the series and that they knew they only wanted the 2 seasons, but the ""Dark Knight Rises"" ending was odd. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I can't come up with a reason not to keep this show going. It was wonderful and you can keep the formula similar and it still works. Ash vs evil dead was able to pull it off.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I upvoted every comment in this thread without realizing I was doing it. I love this show. 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Glad the two kept their friendship in the end. 

The new vice principal had me smiling from ear to ear. That whole scene. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Great ending
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I love what Danny and Jody are doing for television and comedy in general. They bring this weird, dark, almost esoteric southern comedy charm that most people don‚Äôt know exists. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Best. Sendoff. Ever. 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Got it in my list ;)
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I totally forgot this show came back a couple months ago, just watched all the episodes in like 4 hours. That was fucking incredible. It was such a batshit crazy finale and I love it."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Great show! Love Walton Goggins!
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"This show completely exceeded all expectations. 

I fucking loved it. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I dropped off during the first couple of episodes, deciding that I'd watch it all when it finished. I slammed through the whole thing this weekend ending with the finale last night like an 18-hour feud movie. It was incredible. Loved the whole thing. Mcbride, Green, and Hill are ridiculously underrated at what they do."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,i need to watch this
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Good points, well made"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Can‚Äôt wait to see what show McBride will do next. Eastbound and Down and Vice Principals we‚Äôre both amazing.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I was hoping we would see the shooting from last season from the shooter's perspective, see what they were going through when they did it. (trying to keep it vague so I don't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.)"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,loved that fucking ending.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Just watched the first season and god daaamn it‚Äôs hilarious. Was a random find, but damn if this isn‚Äôt one of the funniest shows I‚Äôve seen- I laugh hard at almost everything Danny McBride and Goggins say"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,season 1 dragged a little but season 2 was expertly written.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Started off as a rather generic comedy imo but then it became something hilarious, crazy and interesting."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"The finale was great and satisfying, if somewhat predictable.  But the previous episode was the true gem. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,https://media.giphy.com/media/qmMHsOYvARiVO/giphy.gif
The Quintessential Quintuplets,He is the best character/supporting actor working right now.   
The Quintessential Quintuplets,How he didn‚Äôt get an Emmy for being Shane Vandrell on The Shield will forever be a mystery to me. Especially in those final episodes.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Watch my shit, watch my shit."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,No way! Just as they bring stevie back? I was unaware the series was over until after. I thought season 3 would bring that iconic duo of Stevie and McBride back together!
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"perfect ending though. when it ends early and just right, we wish there was more. then some shows stretch it and it sucks."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"damn. i thought the ending was too easy and walton would make a comeback somehow but i guess there's no way to write it. it's so weird that his character wasnt gay, based on how he acted at the strip club. 

edit: it turns out that was only episode 8, episode 9 is the finale. i was watching it on torrent and i thought the show already ended but the final episode only aired this sunday."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I think Danny McBride is the most underrated comedian of our time.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I feel like Nash is super underrated
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Completely agree, it reeked of the pineapple express fight at Reds house. Comedy mixed with genuine pain. Plus it doesn't look staged when they do fights like that, beause they just fight like 2 men in their 40s who dont really know how to fight with a slight injection of silliness for comedic effect. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"""I got eaten by a fucking tiger...how stupid is that"" was hilarious."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Going from The Walking Dead to Vice Principals was quite the turn tables turning. 

And some GoT deja vu. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,it's also only a young tiger too. way too small and skinny.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I was drunk as shit watching this episode so I'm like what the fuck is happening right now
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"[spoiler](#s ""Not a villain. Just an arsonist"")"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Totally agree! I just finished watching it and, wow...how completely beautifully written and acted. The scene at the end when Neil and Lee spot each other and you can feel the emotion between them....ahhhh... What a great series this was."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I know, right? I really went into this episode not expecting much, I wasn't expecting a great ending to the story."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"It had everything you could ask for in a television show - melodrama, drama, suspense, action, and comedy. All showcased beautifully in the finale "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I hope he continues to do short run projects like this, the limited run sitcom is something we should be seeing a lot more of."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Whats the new project? Are you talking a literal next week?

Because with vice principals and John oliver seasons being finished kinda bums me out. Sunday is usually the best day for tv."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Alright, you seem to be the only person in this thread that isn't 100% blowing this show under the bleachers. As someone who gave up after the first 6 or so episodes of season 1 because it was the same setup every episode (do something terrible that ends up making the target stronger at the end), does it change? I'm not a big fan of shitty people doing shitty things that are justified for the sake of comedy. I find the characters unrelatable because of it. 

I feel like my downvotes kinda prove what I was saying at the beginning. It's cool though, y'all dig the show. My bad."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Man, the return of remorseless murdering psychopath Boyd was fucking amazing."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Agreed.  Season 1 was enjoyable but a little rough around the edges.  Some of the heartfelt moments felt out of place and some of the mean dark humor seemed unnecessary.   

Season 2 however had the show's vision and tone down to a tee.  It mixed the dark comedy, character attributes and plotlines really well.  I was a lot more invested in Vice Principal's season 2 plotline than Stranger Thing's season 2 ..."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I'd love to so Goggins and Steven Ogg do something, they seem like brothers from another mother. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I was so psyched when they revealed who it was. He and McBride together are fucking magic.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Yea first time I saw this show, I just knew someone was getting eaten by a tiger."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Who's the girl?

Edit: I am the dumbest person alive :/"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Forgot he was on SoA
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Omg. Had no idea. That's so cool 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Dontchu disrespek my boi Shea Whigham!

The man is in goddamn E V E R Y T H I N G"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"I would submit David Constible as at least equal to Goggins- The Wire, Breaking Bad, Suits, Billions "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Didn't get shit for Justified either AFAIK, criminal."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"""Family meeting!"""
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Agreed, i always thought it was a travesty that he never got recognized for his role on the Shield. "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,it's bad that I haven't watched EastBound and Down right.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,They filmed it all at the same time 2 years ago. It was written and produced completely with the knowledge it would only be 2 seasons and then finish.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,The Eastbound&Down season in mexico is one of the greatest things ever on tv
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Basically every line from a side character was gold in its own way. 
The Quintessential Quintuplets,At least she ain't dangerous...
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Her first scenes when shes trying to learn the ropes from Gamby are hilarious.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I honestly watched both episodes back to back. Felt weird.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,I watched Vice Principals before Walking Dead.  Bad night for tigers.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,they made it pretty obvious who the stuffed the package in the van.
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Is it just me or did he really die and that was just Mcbride imagining him alive?
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Even before reading this article, I couldn't help but think of Raylan and Boyd at the end of Justified.  "
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"The 2nd season was extremely well made imo.   The 1st season was good but a little rough around the edges.  The 2nd season had the show down to a tee.  It mixed comedy, plot, and the darkness really well.  It's a shame it's already over."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Not starting for a while probably, Danny just said in an interview tonight that he was working on a new project with HBO."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,still have curb your enthusiasm
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"Horrible title, but SMILF on showtime is promising, and Search Party comes back to TBS next week. So while Sundays will deff be much lighter, at least there's a few things to carry it to the end of the year"
The Quintessential Quintuplets,None of the main characters are particularly relatable but the story does advance beyond those first couple of episodes into something strange and amazing.  
The Quintessential Quintuplets,"So my pitch would be that compared to Eastbound and Down, VP was always envisioned as one limited story. It was originally going to be a movie, and when they realized it was too much story, it extended into an 18-episode limited series. What you saw in the first 6 or so episodes was like the first half hour of a movie, and a lot of set-up. The plot really goes some fun places after that, and I think ends up being tighter and more rewatchable than Eastbound and Down, and just as funny."
The Quintessential Quintuplets,Yes it does change. 
Another Life,"Wow thanks. I already gave up on the show, but it seems the stupidity from s1 kept continuing."
Another Life,"Lol I admit it's not great TV. I only watch it because of Katee Sackoff because of BSG. She literally carries the show lol. Most everyone else was pretty üôÑüôÑüôÑ.

I like Justin Chatwin too from Shameless but he as ""Husband"" Erik Wallace is a bit over-the-top too. Like, I totally understand they hadn't cast Ellen Tigh as Niko's mom in Season 1, but seriously, they should've sent the daughter to either side's grandparents and just leave her out of the show as much as possible. She was/is an annoying little brat too. I don't want to be an asshole and say she had it coming for running out to the ALIEN artifact and getting herself irradiated and getting cancer, but she sorta did. You don't know what effects the Alien artifact could do, so you should send you daughter far away somewhere to be as safe as possible, and not bring her into the freaking tent right beside the artifact. Husband was not a good father.

The only redeeming part of the show IMHO is that they kill off most of the annoying AF early-20s Team 1 crew from Season 1. Even Superman (Tyler Hoechlin) couldn't last 1 EP lol. I also wished they killed Bernie instead of Beauchamp. Bernie was an idiot that got the crew infected, which then got the biochemist woken from Soma and sucked out the airlock, and got the Crew irradiated with Gamma radiation, sterilizing the crew. And then his leg got infected. He should've lost his leg and then the infection continued and he died. Something on those lines. Beauchamp was smart Alec but I liked him at least, and he was more together than Cas.

Aside from the üôÑüôÑüôÑ of Seth that OP ranted on about (which I wholeheartedly agree with as I thought similiar thoughts as I was watching), Season 2 was better than season 1, in that they woke Richard and the 1-legged guy and things seriously got done, no fking early-20s unprofessional whining BS we got in Season 1. If Richard's Dream Team had been woken in Season 1, it probably wouldn't have been (as big of) a üóëÔ∏èüî•."
Another Life,I'm surprised you kept watching after the first episode. What a fucking cringe fest that was
Another Life,"Holy jesus, they made a second season of this? Did those kids ever get back to earth in time for spring break or whatever they were in such a hurry to risk their lives? I was hoping Starbuck would tell them there was a hot new club in the airlock then eject them all and wake up the apparently perfectly qualified but presumably way less hot backup crew."
Another Life,"I was more annoyed by  the girl that decided to shoot a local on that habitable planet and then throwing a fit (and mutiny) because she want to start colonizing the planet which she had no right to bdw since it already has intelligent life.Atleast the bitch and the rest of her idiot friends get it in the end.

Season 1 had the same issue.Ppl ignoring orders and doing everything they want.It's like I was watching impulsive teenagers  and not the best humanity has to offer."
Another Life,It seems this sub doesn't allow people to share opinions  if it's not praising the shit out of it. Weird
Another Life,Season 2 was definitely horrendous lol but I had to see it through to the end just to see what kind of bullshit they had conjured up
Another Life,"This show is a glorious train wreck. It basically can't seem to figure out what show it wants to be so it uses a bunch if sci fi buzz words and hashes together some of the most cliche plots that it is just off putting. Not to mention the writing is awful and the acting is subpar at best.  And, while I get it is a show, the science is just unbelievable on every front. Not to mention they keep killing off people and then having this endless supply of replacement crew that are in cyro sleep. They rotated through so many red shirts that I just didn't care about any of the crew dying because it was just needless drama they had to do like every episode.


The show is awful and I seriously couldn't stop looking away from how bad it was.  It is basically a comedy at this point."
Another Life,"After that episode where a guy space walking fucking HEARD the enemy spaceship approaching and the ""sonic booms"" heard on the surface of the planet by Salvere's FTL jumps I couldn't watch any more."
Another Life,"If you decided to watch season 2 after seeing season 1, you really have no one to blame for this but yourself."
Another Life,"That ball scene where none of them are wearing hazmats in a random tent and it's just like 5 people observing...


That would've been an army sized team with cameras and a ton of scientists and equipment. Not 5 guys in the desert"
Another Life,How the hell did this show not get canceled after season 1?
Another Life,I actually loved how dumb this show was. Perfect dumb but enjoyable tv. More like a did they really/ what crazy will they do next watch than a pure hate watch.
Another Life,"You had me at the very first sentence. Clearly you know a thing or two about bad TV.

I've never actually watched this one, but I was curious if it would improve, since some shows do figure things out after a rocky first season. Seems that is not the case.

Thank you for your sacrifice.

P.S. Have you checked out ""La Brea"", by any chance?"
Another Life,"I used season one as a perfect storm of never-ever-do-this writing examples, incomprehensible character development/dialog/behavior, and complete lack of envisioned plot -- let alone casting and acting issues which were just painful to endure. I couldn't finish writing up one example before another came up and I was pausing every few minutes. 

This show, hands down, provoked the most uncontrolled expostulations 'what the *fuck*!?!' of any show I've ever watched, and that includes the original *Dune* movie, may it live in infamy. I'm pretty sure if you played *Another Life* in a prisoner-of-war camp, it'd be a war crime.

I didn't think I'd have the stomach to consider writing up season 2 but I'd been vaguely considering it recently. **Thank you for saving me from myself.**"
Another Life,I think season 2 is better then season 1. Some people need to get over the silly fun i did i like for what its was. if wanted to watch a amazing space show i would watch the expanse
Another Life,"I have no idea how this got renewed, I just know the first season left me on the floor rolling with laughter, it was that bad. Such a fun watch, I'll have to check out the second season soon."
Another Life,"I think history would like a word with you. Members of a government being wowed by and siding with an invader is not a possibility it's a historical fact. Historically those in charge and the wealthy have gladly sided with stronger invaders even when their intentions were less than honorable and would destroy the majority of the population. 

The plot of season 2 wasn't dumb so much as it was rushed to a happy resolution because the show was going to end after 2 instead of 3 seasons. 

If you believe that in the face of a non aggressive alien invasion our leaders would resist instead of collaborating then I'd call you blissfully na√Øve."
Another Life,Maybe stop watching.
Another Life,">AND THEN, the human space ship returns to earth, and it reports that the Achaia have a track record of brainwashing and genociding every planet they come across. And their strategy that led to all this brainwashing and genociding on other planets is being implemented in an identical manner on earth.  
  
You'd think at this point the government would arrest Seth... but nah. Even though the government hears all these reports, and even though the reports get leaked to the media so everyone on earth knows the Achaia are genocidal... Seth keeps his job. Seriously. He only loses it when the Achaia explode his head as part of a stupid diplomatic message.

oh you sweet summer child, you know so little about the world

and the pandemic has shown us that our species is nonsensical and doomed"
Another Life,I could by some guy getting enamored with alien tech. I thought this isn't that bad but then It got so much worse.
Another Life,"I've always been curious about this show.  I'm both glad I haven't bothered to watch it and thankful you did lol.    Sounds like an utter shitshow.

Reminds me of a book I just bailed on a few chapters in.  Giant humanity-saving spaceship setting off to colonize the stars.  Immediately the head of the civilians threatens the life of the ship captain... and absolutely nothing is done.  But! Someone else threatens the head of security and the whole mission and is sentenced to death by the captain.  The captain then single-handedly takes the traitor to an airlock but instead of spacing him he tries to surreptitiously return him to the civilian side... and is busted and threatened again by the same guy who threatened him the first time.

It's at this point I wish I were reading a literal book I could have burnt, but it was just my kindle so I deleted it as hard as I could.   Just asinine beyond juvenile writing"
Another Life,At least they killed off all the vapid 20 somethings in the first like ten minutes.
Another Life,"Gotta say. When you really think about it.. human history is just as ridiculously stupid as the season 2 plot. Like literally it's not that far fetched that we wouldn't allow something like that. If you ever listen to the dollop podcast you'd understand. Tge writing is only stupid from the standpoint that the actions are stupid not from the angle of ""no one would let this happen"".. because history has shown we most definitely would let these things happen."
Another Life,"I just started ep. 1 of the show and already don't want to continue ...

Seriously, why are these people crew of a starship?"
Another Life,"I couldn't get past the first few episodes of season 2. The plotline must have been crafted by kindergarteners.  It's so juvenile...we want to be your friends, we want to kill you, no wait... Save us and we'll leave you alone... we're so trustworthy."
Another Life,"I'm persisting with S2, probably unwisely. I attributed the culling of crew in ep 1 as actors not wanting to renew or they got too expensive."
Another Life,That is the ending scene I would have liked to have seen.
Another Life,well if you actually watched the second season instead of whining you'd have known because they explained why the crew was crap
Another Life,"Lol pretty sure the ""micro-wormholes"" were their version of the rings in The Expanse"
Another Life,I actually liked that this show wasn't afraid to kill off cast members. Made the show more believable/ unique in a sense.
Another Life,at least they watched everything first and then made their own opinion unlike you
Another Life,"why didnt they drop it on mars was my thinking, they got a base there."
Another Life,"> P.S. Have you checked out ""La Brea"", by any chance?

Literally the first thing that came to mind reading the opening lines of the original post was ""but how does it compare to La Brea in terms of badness?"""
Another Life,">I've never actually watched this one

then why are you even commenting?"
Another Life,I think you just answered your own question
Another Life,I appreciate being warned about garbage
Another Life,"I attributed it to ""hopefully they read all the negative criticism about their absurd characters and so killed them ASAP so they can get new better actors for a better team""

That's my wishful thinking anyways. Since none of those 20-somethings are well-known actors to begin with.... At least I didn't recognize any of them"
Another Life,"Lazy writing? Budget? Idk. It turned into TNG when she's kidnapped by some 3rd alien species... Season 2 was better than 1 imo.


Having said that the finale was all pantomime... What happened to the budget?"
Another Life,"oh so you're one of those internet people who call everything that's not perfect ""garbage"". Everything is either a masterpiece for you or total trash, never anything in between right

I have shocking news for you, it's totally fine watching guilty pleasure, mediocre media"
Another Life,"I was thinking why they didn't do it on Mars too... Only answer my head canon could conjure would be it works for a finite area, on Mars it could work but then the trees would die immediately because of the atmosphere.

And they totally needed Hazmat suits, they went to the artifact with them, I was +$;+'($)$(!#? Why they so blindly trusted the ball wasn't harmful to them"
Another Life,"Do you work for the show or something,  your comments in this thread LOL"
Another Life,"The first season of this made less sense than under the Dome, I can't wait"
Another Life,How did this get a season 2.
Another Life,wait i thought this was cancelled? what the ffff
Another Life,I only watched the first episode but it was legitimately one of the worst shows I have ever watched.
Another Life,Love this show.
Another Life,Are you f-ing kidding me? This was like an advanced course of everything you **should not ever do** in writing. Let alone film it.
Another Life,I love space sf but try as I might to like it I couldn't. This show sucked.
Another Life,"I couldn't even finish the first episode.

The most important mission in human history, and they send a bunch of catty instagrammers, with a screaming toddler as a second in command?"
Another Life,Who actually liked this? And what about it did you enjoy?
Another Life,Is it just me or is there a lot more screaming on this show than other shows?
Another Life,wait...this got another season? I thought it was universally agreed that it was dreadful
Another Life,"Yay for the return of Another Life. I love it! Reminds me of the space set nonsense sci-fi that we got a lot of from SyFy in years gone by. It has a few logic flaws for sure and is no Emmy contender but I thought the first season was a ton of fun and very engaging. 

Hopefully it pulls in the viewers to make it to a third season. The fact that Netflix are dropping it a day before You s3 is not exactly a sign they have a lot of faith in it!"
Another Life,This got a new season and Lost in Space didn't.  Ok.  I'm going to go ride my dog out to the ranch and walk my horses.
Another Life,Was there like a bet to see how many times you could fit a line with 'Achaia' in it into the trailer?
Another Life,Can‚Äôt wait it. I hate watched the whole show just like I would have had sex with my worst crazy ex girlfriend and then deeply regret it later.
Another Life,"This show was terrible..... But I'll still watch it.

There's no possibility of it getting a season 3, so I hope they actually end it, instead of leaving it on a cliffhanger or something."
Another Life,At this point I'm pretty sure Netflix uses its own platform to launder money.
Another Life,Finally.
Another Life,"I know a lot of people hated this show but it was just different enough to keep my interest. I hate the internet star character, but I'm fine with the rest of it."
Another Life,Honestly thought this was cancelled. Still salty about Society and Teenage Bounty Hunters
Another Life,I'm amazed. final space is cancelled and this trash fire is renewed
Another Life,"I was going to give it a try but then I read ""worst-reviewed show of 2019 on metacritic"" for season 1.

https://www.metacritic.com/tv/another-life"
Another Life,"First season is boring and disappointing. A total loss of time. They should have deleted first season and make a prologue episode. S2 is way better. Still can‚Äôt believe they canceled dark Crystal, etc instead of this."
Another Life,Why is the main character so skinny? She looks sickly and unhealthy.
Another Life,A show so breathtakingly stupid that if it were a person it would have to be institutionalized. Whoever greenlit another season of this show needs to get kicked in the dick.
Another Life,Under the dome was actually good for a bit.
Another Life,I'm convinced its part of some kind of experiment by Netflix to work out the effect of quality on viewership. Gotta get that baseline reading of how many viewers absolute 0 gets.
Another Life,Guess they had a bit more viewers than 'Away' or 'The I-Land'
Another Life,High ratings
Another Life,There's actually[ an answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGhiKNRoxZU&ab_channel=ScreenRant) for that...
Another Life,"I was so stunned by how bad the first half of the first episode was I started making ""never do this"" notes for my writing group. I couldn't finish writing up one thing before another came up and I had to pause.

It managed to get worse episode after episode. I still don't know how."
Another Life,"I only watched this show for Tyler Hoechlin and I was so relieved when he died in the first episode. 

I would have watched the whole thing for him."
Another Life,Who knew their were so many assholes in space?
Another Life,I watched the first ~20 minutes and dipped out when an entire crew started panicking that the mission might change a little.
Another Life,I wouldn't say I liked it. I would say it made me laugh. A lot. And unintentionally.
Another Life,"I liked it because it felt like a bad B movie made a baby with a decent gritty scifi reboot and there were some really great intense moments, some really awesome emotional moments, and then some ""Really that's bullshit oh my god"" laugh out loud moments that made you throw popcorn at the screen.  So it's a fun little mix of a bit of everything that really makes you question just how any of them are going to survive at all while setting up a massive bigger picture plot that feels akin to the Culture series by Iain M Banks.  So I guess I'm kind of hoping that they touch on that stuff because it really does feel like Earth and the crew of this ship is just a tiny little ant accidentally stumbling upon a nest of Replicators from Stargate."
Another Life,"Well, I didn't like it at all, but I am looking forward to watching season 2. I've never been a person to hate watch things, but  this is the one thing I hated so much I can't wait to see where it goes."
Another Life,"Reminds me of Stargate Universe, which I really enjoyed."
Another Life,"> This got a new season and Lost in Space didn't.


There is a third season of 'Lost in Space' that will be out in Christmas."
Another Life,"> But I'll still watch it.

This is how terrible shows get greenlit over other, better shows that would otherwise have been."
Another Life,"Thank you for supporting inferior Netflix shows. With your help, we can ruin their entire line-up."
Another Life,It's not their fault enough people watched it. People who watched it? kick them in the dicks if you must.
Another Life,"I know there was lots of stupid stuff but the thing that sticks with me the most...the stupid thing that made me laugh so hard I can't forget it...was they were like ""to kill this space microorganism we stupidly picked up we're going to go into a star that will only sterilize us instead of killing us...because reasons"" and then they weren't even sterilized."
Another Life,"This got more viewers than Hillary Swank Goes To Mars with Mark ""I Play All The Cosmonauts"" Ivanir?

Good thing we still have For All Mankind."
Another Life,"> The I-Land

I remember watching that in the background. Started out intriguing and even seemed like it had a plan for where it was going but then things got stupid and characters got annoying."
Another Life,"Oh God, why did you have to remind me of Away? It could have been legitimately great and it just ended up being a clusterfuck."
Another Life,Absolutely. I was also one of the few fans of Stargate Universe. Such a pity it got cancelled when it did as it was a fun Stargate that leaned more into space-sci-fi than the usual Stargate shows did!
Another Life,Well you have made my day.  Thank you.
Another Life,"Actually, I'm a third of the way through the 2nd season, and it's actually not terrible.

A lot of scifi shows have garbage first seasons. Who doesn't skip ""Emancipation"" on an SG1 rewatch? This show actually picked up an interesting story towards the end of its first season, and we'll see how it goes.

I could be wrong, though. This could degrade back into trash quickly. We'll see."
Another Life,... did you watch it? ...
Another Life,"> Good thing we still have For All Mankind.

Indeed. And in just a week we will have 'Foundation' as well."
Another Life,I turned it off within 3 minutes. Worst dialogue I've ever heard in a TV show. Looked like it was made by students.
Another Life,Any time.
Another Life,"Lost in Space. Otherwise known as the show where anything that can go wrong does indeed go wrong. 

I love it but jesus nothing ever goes right in that show."
Another Life,No :)
Another Life,Oh wow this year has been moving to quick can't believe that's already here.  Here's hoping they don't mess it up.
Another Life,"Yeah it was pretty laughably bad, and I tend to be forgiving."
Another Life,This show got renewed? Wtf? Where‚Äôs the new season of Lost in Space?

Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Super stoked on most of this. I‚Äôm especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down ‚Äî> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,that's a lot of content
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I‚Äôm sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,[deleted]
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Any specific dates to go with this?
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,[deleted]
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,*holds up lighter*
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Thanks man you're awesome
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Not enough üöÄüöÄüöÄ
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they‚Äôve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,It‚Äôs pretty genius
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Super into the Acolyte as I‚Äôd really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"There‚Äôs like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"This didn‚Äôt mention any of the Marvel movies since it‚Äôs still not certain whether they‚Äôll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that‚Äôs released.

If you haven‚Äôt watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you‚Äôre right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn‚Äôt it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,That‚Äôs pathetic
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,[deleted]
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo. 

&nbsp;

Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,[deleted]
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Disney doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren‚Äôt matched.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don‚Äôt HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I‚Äôm betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We‚Äôll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn‚Äôt call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That‚Äôs not the only genre.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"American Dad is on TBS

I think we'll get the same nominees as last year (The Simpsons, Bob's Burgers, South Park, and Big Mouth) with What If... or Rick and Morty filling in for Primal."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"Animation in the US award shows is sadly always the most overlooked content. So many still find its only for ""kids"" and cant be serious drama for adults. (Filthy comedy yes)


I imagine What if and Arcane will be the non basic comedy amimated series to get nominated. 


Love death and robots should win the short section"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,it is a crime that bojack horseman never won this.
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,where tf is invincible?
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Huh. I'm surprised Nightmare of the Wolf is eligible; it stands out among everything here as being the only movie. And FXX was able to submit Poorly Drawn Lines and Swan Boy as single entries even though Poorly Drawn Lines was effectively a whole season of episodes and Swan Boy was a series of shorts?
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,Arcane nominated for animation and Jibaro for the short form? Thats all I could ask for
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"I don't see What if...? nominated, mainly because it would be too much of a Disney domain, Arcane will probably be nominated due to his sweep of the Annie Awards and the aggressive campaign that Netflix and Riot have done, the rest I agree"
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"

After primal won the emmy last year, it gave me some hope that the awards can improve, although they still have a way to go. That's why I strongly see an Arcane nomination.

Love death and robots is clearly the favorite to win the emmy in short section, the only one that can compete with it is Star Wars Vision, but having Alberto Mielgo, who just won the oscar for best animated short, gives it a plus."
Transformers Rescue Bots Academy,"> I imagine What if and Arcane will be the non basic comedy amimated series to get nominated. 

You forgot Undone. It is a critically acclaimed animation from Amazon. Season 2 was released in April."
Beecham House,"It's Mrs. Patmore, who is not the person in the thumbnail. "
Beecham House,"That is correct. The thumbnail pic is of the person named in the title, creator Gurinder Chadha."
Beecham House,This could be fun. I wonder when it is going to air.
Beecham House,Looking forward to the hot steamy scenes from the series! 
Beecham House,No premiere date even for ITV that I could find.
Beecham House,"I watch a lot of PBS, but the video.pbs.org interface is horrible. I wish it was more like netflix... even though I donate to PBS every month, I still find myself watching more PBS shows on Netflix than PBS itself."
Beecham House,"Does it have Globe Trekker? 

Sadly PBS doesn't seem to broadcast it anymore"
Beecham House,Does it have masterpiece?
Beecham House,[deleted]
Beecham House,All of the Ken Burns docs as well.
Beecham House,You forgot Downton Abbey.
Beecham House,Does it it have new content as it airs and does it have Nova and Frontline
Beecham House,"I have a similar subscription, for what's basically the Dutch version of PBS. There are so many great series on there. A boat load of Scandinavian detectives, British detectives, and *all* the good Dutch content."
Beecham House,"i watched all Beecham House yesterday, i really liked it until the last episode. It was really strong, but i really dislike that they use contemporary paper for these shows, really takes me out of it. I liked Vienna Blood (c.1900s Vienna) which is on passport. Plus the PBS digital studios have some interesting shows, like 'Say it Loud'. And PBS news hour has a lot more content on their youtube page throughout the day."
Beecham House,"Oh, I agree.  The fact that they don't hold the spot you stopped watching and just recently automatically started playing the next episode (rather than having you search for it) is pretty bad, but the content is worth it, I think.  They'll get there as more people sign up."
Beecham House,"Do you mean the website? I never use it... but man, they have one of the best streaming apps out there so your comment seems crazy to me."
Beecham House,"Yeah, lot of them.  Not all historically, but a good selection."
Beecham House,You recorded 30 years of content?  Wow.
Beecham House,Where?  It seems like only the most current one is available.
Beecham House,"Most of the Burns docs are (or were, I haven't checked lately) already on Netflix."
Beecham House,"Well, all of DA is on Prime too."
Beecham House,"The Masterpiece series will let you watch the entire thing usually once the first episode airs on regular TV.  I've already finished Beecham House.  With Ken Burns Vietnam, it gave you access to the first 5 once the first one aired and then the rest once episode 6 aired.  And yes, Nova and Frontline are usually on there but I don't watch them on TV so I don't know how soon they're posted."
Beecham House,I‚Äôve never had that happen. The app is so great. I only use it on Apple TV tho. Maybe it sucks on other platforms...
Beecham House,Most of the recent stuff from a quick look is there.
Beecham House,[deleted]
Beecham House,"Sounds pretty good, thank you!"
Beecham House,Lol. Wow. So you have 30 years of pbs recorded on your dvr?! THATS AMAZING.
Beecham House,[deleted]
Beecham House,That‚Äôs a super good reason to suggest people not support PBS and subscribe. Thanks for your valuable input friend!
My Hotter Half,It only got clearer in the last 39 minutes
My Hotter Half,"It's not a new ""these days"" technique. It's day-for-night. Been around for probably the majority of film history at this point. As with many things, you only hate it when it's done badly. When it's done well it just looks like night.

But yeah the bad use of it in this episode was very noticeable."
My Hotter Half,This technique only works well if it's overcast when they shoot. This gives soft diffused shadows. You can't plan for weather in a filming schedule.  I believe in mad max recently they used giant cranes to block the sunlight so they could do day for night more effectively but I reckon hotd doesn't have the budget or the scale is to big.
My Hotter Half,"Don‚Äôt hate the technique, hate the execution imo. Because a lot of times, it‚Äôs the only way to shoot visually readable scenes that take place at night without lots of lights. For example, all of the nighttime stuff in *Nope* looks immaculate, and because it takes place in an empty field with no lights, the *only* way for it to look good is to shoot day-for-night. The alternative is using digital cameras and cranking up the grain to the point where it looks like the *Miami Vice* movie, which I personally like the look of, but it would not be appropriate for a fantasy show about dragons."
My Hotter Half,Miguel yet again not knowing how to properly execute a night scene.
My Hotter Half,"It's been done like that for ages, but often more artful. I'm currently re-watching old 90s series and noticed it done nicely a few times.

One of the problem is that current shows are made for a specific, current setup. Basically, sit in a relatively dark room with a well calibrated HDR TV. And hope that your media source did not mess up the encoding.   
Not my thing either but trends come and go."
My Hotter Half,"People keep trying to blame the TVs. Like ok, I am sure it looks good on the newest technology, but when more than half of the viewers are likely on older sets, maybe you shouldn't film in a way that only shows up well for a minority of viewers."
My Hotter Half,"This thread was made for me. Finally after not being able to see shit the entire season I threw a temper and said fuck it! Paused the episode at night time scene and spent 10 minutes tinkering with every custom setting my TV had and now I can see. 

It happened when Aemon was walking up on Vhagar in the night. I literally couldn‚Äôt tell it if it was Vhagar or a dark sand dune and I lost my shit."
My Hotter Half,"The only point of contention I have is with the ""Worst"" part.

I invite you to check the Were panther episode of MST3K.

Now that's some REALLY bad day with a filter for night scenes."
My Hotter Half,I was wondering wtf they did it. Maybe its cos you aren't supposed to work child actors at night?  A lot of kids in that episode..
My Hotter Half,"It's tough to film proper night time scenes especially if there are budgetary concerns. The Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema has apparently been working on a solution to this on Ad Astra and more recently Nope, both of which had excellent night scenes (the former space scenes technically). I'm not smart enough to understand it but apparently she shoots in daylight with two cameras, one in infrared and one regular and then layers them on top of one another. Hopefully whatever he's doing becomes the standard because the night scenes in Nope looked great, at least on a movie screen."
My Hotter Half,"For as long as I can remember people have complained about night shots in film. 

Before HDR, they would light night scenes in such a way that it was clear they were unnaturally lit. 

Then HDR came and people with improperly calibrated TVs sitting in bright rooms complained they couldn‚Äôt see anything. 

Now they‚Äôre doing this day for night thing and people continue to complain. 

One day they‚Äôll figure it out, I‚Äôm sure."
My Hotter Half,There are some technical issues with this show. Why is a creaky door ten times as loud as any of the dialogue?
My Hotter Half,"Mine too.  I have a $2000 Samsung QLED TV and I swear I went through every picture setting possible during those scenes and it all looked dark, blurry and washed out.  It was torturous to watch.  I'm glad I didn't have to see the incest play out, tbh"
My Hotter Half,I assumed the scene was fake disk so it didn‚Äôt concern me too much. It didn‚Äôt distract me from the dialogue.
My Hotter Half,"I tried watching the show on a different device and the picture was fine. So something is wrong with the picture settings on my TV. I tried adjusting but it was still too dark, so I guess I'll be watching on my pc instead."
My Hotter Half,"I had this problem on the first view but I knew I had a decent TV that had dolbyvision, HDR, good brightness range (I don‚Äôt know the technical term for it). It was supposed to show dark scenes well.

I ran through these simple settings from [this](https://youtu.be/CDCfyQ4PU-Q) video and went back and watched it and it made a huge difference. The night scenes were absolutely beautiful and I could definitely tell it was much closer to what the creators intended.

It‚Äôs a tough issue to address because the real problem, in my opinion, is the average TV (and the average person configuring it) isn‚Äôt going to show these scenes well. But the director knew what he was going for and, now that I‚Äôve seen it properly, I love how it looks. I don‚Äôt think the director should compromise his vision because the viewer may not be able to view it properly, but I also think they‚Äôre naturally going to open themselves up to criticism."
My Hotter Half,"I have a Dolby Vision TV and I thought it looked gorgeous. When it‚Äôs just a full moon in the backyard, last night‚Äôs episode mimicked it perfectly I felt"
My Hotter Half,Lol that isn't new dude. That's how most TV shows film night time scenes.
My Hotter Half,"there is no nighttime, there is only yellow sun and blue sun"
My Hotter Half,I assumed they did it to make the CGI easier to do.
My Hotter Half,They just increased the darkness one degree too far. It would've been fine if it was a little bit lighter. The extra darkness could've been used only for the shots that showed the sky.
My Hotter Half,Nope
My Hotter Half,"I do think the amount of the episode that was set during the ""night"" outside definitely made it a worse experience. Like one short scene of it may have looked just as bad, but hardly as annoying. Having so much of the episode set in that weird non-twilight color just made it all the more apparent and a greater annoyance. In the end I don't think it was enough to ruin the episode or anything, but I definitely agree it didn't look great."
My Hotter Half,"I remember watching the directors commentary in Life and Brian and Terry Jones was explaining ""The first rule of day-for-night that competent filmmakers follow is, never show the sky. So of course here you can see us trying day-for-night with the sky taking up most of the shot"""
My Hotter Half,">When it's done well it just looks like night.

It doesn't. But when done well, at least it's not a distraction.  

The issue here is that it was not done well.  In fact this might literally be the worst day for night I've ever seen, no exaggeration.  They were on some serious crack when they shot this.  It was awful."
My Hotter Half,[deleted]
My Hotter Half,Yeah there were episodes of The Andy Griffith Show where they used this method.
My Hotter Half,"The cranes freak out the dragons, learned that one the hard way and the crane operators union won't come near the production anymore"
My Hotter Half,"If Mad Max did try to block the sunlight, they were inconsistent with it. There were definitely hard shadows. Doesn't really matter, since long exposure photography under moonlight looks pretty similar to day-for-night, shadows and all."
My Hotter Half,"I seem to remember reading that Nope used a new filming technique that used two cameras, one was infrared, the other was a camera with a prism attachment.

yeah heres an article about it.

https://amplify.nabshow.com/articles/create-what-did-i-just-see-the-cinematography-of-nope/ 

>Van Hoytema was to build a camera rig that combined an infrared 65mm camera and a film camera through a prism. It was new technology that went through a lot of evolutions, but in the end, they figured out technically how to do it. ‚ÄúWe then mixed those images to create something that felt so similar to that feeling of seeing through the darkness.‚Äù"
My Hotter Half,With a show that has had so many dark scenes you think they would‚Äôve figured it out by now
My Hotter Half,"To be fair, ***Nope*** was also shot using two different cameras‚Äîone 35mm and the other an infrared camera‚Äîwhere shots from the latter were overlayed with the 35mm in post to manage lighting in a way that‚Äôs similar to the type of light we‚Äôd experience on the moon. Still a day-for-night shot, but the technology produced a much different outcome than what we‚Äôre seeing in HoTD.

From [this article](https://ymcinema.com/2022/08/03/nope-was-shot-on-a-unique-day-for-night-rig-of-alexa-65-infrared-and-panavision-system-65/)

> Hoyte explains: ‚ÄúThe infrared camera is only sensitive to very specific wavelengths of light and the images are monochromatic (as shown in the examples above). When you shoot in natural sunlight, with a slight contrast boost, it results in images that are brightly lit, however, the skies are dark. However, the 35mm camera contains all of the vital color and texture information. In the perfect composite of the two images in post-production, the desert resembled the lunar surface. That meant we got close to the lighting character on the real moon. So for Nope, I had the idea of scaling up that same kind of rig and using it to shoot our day-for-night scenes in broad daylight ‚Äì but this time using an ARRI ALEXA 65, pointing upwards vertically and shooting in infrared mode, in perfect alignment with a Panavision System 65mm film camera, which was on the horizontal axis. However, it‚Äôs vitally important that the different gates and lenses are identical, that you have exactly the same depths-of-field, that your focus pulls translate in exactly the same way, and that the two images are completely in-sync.‚Äù"
My Hotter Half,"I like the Miami Vice look too.  I think they could pull it off if they tried to do a one episode ""thing"".  Kind of like the tracking shot in True Detective or 'Rony/Lily' from Barry.  But that is a big risk and honestly you have to have the idea and execute it flawlessly for it to work."
My Hotter Half,">Nope looks immaculate

They did it so well I didn't even know it was day for night until I read this comment"
My Hotter Half,"If it's that dark, though, shouldn't the characters just have lights? That seems like it would solve the problem. I hate it when they do fake darkness, everyone knows what night looks like."
My Hotter Half,"What do I know but if you ask me just film at night with some dim lights, even if it‚Äôs not the most strictly realistic thing. 

Like the Battle of Helm‚Äôs Deep was shot at night with lights and nobody complains about that. 

I just can‚Äôt ignore the uncanny shadows etc with this technique."
My Hotter Half,Daemon could totally rock a leisure suit.
My Hotter Half,"> I am sure it looks good on the newest technology

Means fuck all, I've got a top of the line Sony 4K TV with perfect adjusted settings based on recommended specs from trusted TV channels and in Dolby Vision this episode looked awful on the night scenes. 

Everything else I watched has been completely fine. It is literally just this episode. End of the day it's just poorly executed visuals across the episode and across devices, some people are just either less bothered about it or have their TV settings altered to the point colours and brightness isn't balanced properly in the first place."
My Hotter Half,"it doesn't look good on newest technology. i have a 65"" OLED and couldn't understand anything, it was waaaay too dark"
My Hotter Half,So people that have older tvs or watch on their phones or laptops probably don't care so much about picture quality.  Why should people that pay more to get higher quality video be punished with shitty quality?
My Hotter Half,Aemond
My Hotter Half,This is just excuses. The Battle of Blackwater looked amazing at night and that came out years ago
My Hotter Half,"Nope literally had a giant light suspended over the set of the entire house that the siblings live in, crazy to think of the levels filmmakers go to for making their art. That's some dedication"
My Hotter Half,I don't think there's really a budget problem with this show
My Hotter Half,"Let's be honest, it was extremely noticeable during Nope too. Someone needs to tell the dude that his 'revolutionary' technique isn't very good."
My Hotter Half,I still couldn't see anything for parts of the episode
My Hotter Half,"They‚Äôve been doing this day for night thing for over 100 years, to be fair. So hardly surprising that people continue to complain, this has been what most of the complaints have always been about. Almost every single Alfred Hitchcock movie has long day for night sequences for example and getting the illusion to work without looking totally ridiculous was one of the challenges of moving to color film."
My Hotter Half,People are not wrong for not knowing HDR won't work unless you have an expensive TV.
My Hotter Half,I‚Äôve had no audio issues and saw everything in last night‚Äôs episode completely fine. And I‚Äôm on a TV that‚Äôs older than ten years old. I think this sort of thing really varies between TVs/devices.
My Hotter Half,I think it‚Äôs a HBO Max thing. I have the same issue in any of their 4K HDR movies or shows.
My Hotter Half,I don‚Äôt normally like using subtitles but I‚Äôm having a hard time with the dialogue too.
My Hotter Half,looked fine on my LG C1 OLED but I grabbed a HDR rip which might've been a better source.
My Hotter Half,Everything looked great and easy to see on my 10+ year old TV.
My Hotter Half,"I watched it on my phone and it looked stunning to me tbh, but I have a Sony phone with a 4k OLED panel so that might be why. The dark scenes really show the limit of your TV. I remember watching the Long Night episode and hating every minute of it on my TV."
My Hotter Half,"I have a 6 year old Sony Bravia. Looked fine for me. I watched on hbo max and started about 10 minutes late. I think it was the same director who did ""the (not so) long night"" so it doesn't surprise me people had issues. Although I couldn't see a damn thing in that episode."
My Hotter Half,This is helpful but it's ridiculous that we have to adjust our settings just to watch one show that films a particular way. I don't have this issue with any other shows I watch.
My Hotter Half,">I don‚Äôt think the director should compromise his vision because the viewer may not be able to view it properly

Firmly disagree.  Could you imagine if Nolan demanded Warner Bros release the Dark Knight Blu Ray with half of some of the scenes cropped out because they were shot for IMAX? Like you can't see The Joker's head during the bank heist or can't see half of the action during Batman's extradition mission in Hong Kong just because Nolan envisioned those scenes in a different ratio? 

Or imagine if Tarantino only released his movies as 70mm film reels and couldn't understand 99.999% of his fanbase can't watch a movie in that format at home?"
My Hotter Half,"I think it was a good idea to have the episode slowly change from afternoon to dusk to night, but it would have been a great time to use a massive light controlled volume like Mandolorian uses."
My Hotter Half,Nope sure as hell looked like real night to me.
My Hotter Half,"It‚Äôs done well *all the time*, you just don‚Äôt notice when it is."
My Hotter Half,What the hell are you watching? Literally thousands of film and tv shows have done day for night for decades and it‚Äôs extremely common. Most likely you just haven't noticed it.
My Hotter Half,"Honestly I‚Äôm looking at stills from Nope now and it doesn‚Äôt look good at all, better than HOTD but still. Everything is clearly being lit by sunlight."
My Hotter Half,"I think the technology just isn't there yet. I'm not an expert but I imagine cameras can only be so sensitive to light. Like even in the dark,.my own eyes, I see the grain effect (I hear this is radiation but idk). Maybe it's just not possible to shoot in the dark well?"
My Hotter Half,"You would. I can‚Äôt speak for why they‚Äôre screwing it up, just that it *can* be done well, haha."
My Hotter Half,Across the industry period. It's a common complaint.
My Hotter Half,I feel like people just have zero clue about how any of this shit works yet always have to make assumptions. It‚Äôs not always that simple or that easy and that‚Äôs why we still and probably always will have issues like this even on massive productions like this. Not everyone going to have access to the right equipment at the right time or the right talent getting it done on time.
My Hotter Half,"Exactly. Images are composed, they‚Äôre not all literal. Rings of Power just had a huge nighttime battle and it was all crystal clear. HOD has a misguided creative approach with bad results."
My Hotter Half,idk some guy in the sub told me i was basically homeless for not having mini-led lol
My Hotter Half,There's a massive difference between being a videophile and not being able to see the picture enough to make out anything going on.
My Hotter Half,Was most of that not done on constructed sets?
My Hotter Half,"At the same time, California literally doesn't have enough electricity as it is lol."
My Hotter Half,"Have you seen the lighting contraption from the movie 1917? Check it out at around 8:30 in this video: https://youtu.be/upJw7AqLeeQ


It‚Äôs this massive fake burning church made by a massive lighting rig."
My Hotter Half,"What I mean is that the show costs $20 million an episode and they're  likely often very complex shoots and on pressing timelines, they probably don't have the time or money to sit around inventing new camera techniques. That's something a creative environment like the one on a Jordan Peele movie would be more conducive to."
My Hotter Half,"Yeah honestly I‚Äôm looking at stills from Nope now and it doesn‚Äôt look good at all, better than HOTD but still."
My Hotter Half,"It‚Äôs nice to hear it‚Äôs not just me. Subs make my whole screen light up, so I‚Äôm constantly switching them on and off. The whole industry has problems with dynamics in audio"
My Hotter Half,I watched it on an LG C1 oled and couldn‚Äôt see a thing when even when the room I‚Äôm in was dark
My Hotter Half,"I mean I definitely get your point of view and agreed back when I watched the Battle of Winterfell episode. Since seeing this episode the correct way, though, I definitely appreciate the artistic choice and it looks so much better than the artificial ""darkness"" most TV shows use. You don't have this issue with any other shows you watch because they make the decision to compromise artistic vision to make it more watchable for the average viewer. They're fine with communicating the idea that it's the dark of night rather than actually showing the dark of night. This show actually uses the dark of the night and the light of the moon and candles and other natural light sources and doesn't compromise. If you can get a chance to view it properly, it absolutely looks a thousand times better than most dark scenes in television shows and movies."
My Hotter Half,"I definitely see where you're coming from, especially the way I worded it, but I feel like your examples kind of miss the mark because film format doesn't really have the same problem that lighting does.

Neither Nolan nor Tarantino has to choose in this example because you can shoot it for both. You can release your IMAX version in IMAX theaters and your other theatrical version in other theaters. It's long been a standard to release movies with a wide range of aspect ratios to suit not only different TVs but also to allow those with the ability to watch IMAX at home to do so.

But with lighting it's a choice that's baked in. You'd have to shoot the scene twice, once with natural lighting and once with artificial lighting, for it to be comparable to your example. And we both know that's entirely unrealistic and useless. So what do you do? Do you go with your vision of natural lighting which will look beautiful on TVs that can view it and look borderline unwatchable on TVs that can't? Or do you go with artificial lighting that will look artificial but viewable for everyone?

I think as long as Sapochnik and HBO are willing to accept the criticism placed by the uninformed, they've totally made the right call. Sure, many people can't view it as intended on their tvs and will have to crank up their brightness just to view it, but one day most TVs will probably be able to show it much better.

This part is going into something I get the gist behind but don't fully know every detail about, but bare with me. We've been able to remaster many older films because (I believe) film doesn't necessarily have a ""resolution,"" so when newer screen technologies come out it can be scanned (?) in new ways that reveal a higher definition version that already existed but just wasn't available. It's unlikely it would have happened but imagine a world where things were filmed in the resolution that was available for screens at the time. Why should they  limit themselves to sentencing the show to forever look that way when we're in the midst of an era where we're reaching a higher range of brightnesses (luminosities? there's a word there but it keeps telling me I've got the wrong one) in screens than ever before? Many people can view it correctly now and many more people will be able to view it correctly in the future.

I think that crippling the show using artificial lighting to accommodate (mainly) the people who can't set up their TV correctly is short-sighted, compromises the product and the artist's vision, and is just the wrong move to take. Maybe putting a disclaimer like the other commenter said could help, maybe HBO needs to release other versions where they automatically correct brightness for people who can't set it on their TVs themselves, maybe the blame is on manufacturers that set their TVs to come out of the box and go onto a bright showroom floor. However, I don't think the solution is to shoot it with artificial lighting and accept that it's gonna look like it's not really night for anyone but hey at least everyone can see it."
My Hotter Half,"Okay, if it's your argument that it's only been done well one time in the entire history of movies, then yes, it does look like night when it's done well.

In every instance besides Nope, though, it doesn't look like actual night.

Which is fine.  Like I said above, when it's done well it looks good and isn't distracting.  It just isn't indistinguishable from nighttime.

I mean if this episode had looked like Nope the only discussion would be how did they achieve that amazing cinematography?  Instead of: what were they thinking"
My Hotter Half,Seems like a crazy thing to blatantly lie about but you seem unhealthily dug into your position. For my own safety I won't press any further
My Hotter Half,"> Like even in the dark,.my own eyes, I see the grain effect (I hear this is radiation but idk).

It's called visual snow.  I have it too, most people apparently don't."
My Hotter Half,">  Maybe it's just not possible to shoot in the dark well?

Considering the vast advances made in the last few decades, especially moving off film, no I don't think this can be said."
My Hotter Half,"It really isn't.  Every tv show and movie has nighttime scenes.  And yet we don't have this discussion about every tv show and movie. Are tv viewers commonly complaining about not being able to tell what the hell is going on in those nighttime scenes?  No.  Because every director in Hollywood knows how to shoot night scenes.

This is just House of the Dragon thinking they're going to reinvent something and failing.

If they just shot the show like every other show is shot, no one would be complaining.  It would be fine."
My Hotter Half,"You‚Äôre right it‚Äôs not that easy or simple.  But GoT has millions of dollars to spend an episode, they can afford an experienced gaffer"
My Hotter Half,"No, it was on location"
My Hotter Half,"Love this! Now that I've seen it, seems pretty obvious it must have been a rig but while watching it for the first time, I was too entranced to notice it. 

Deakins is a god"
My Hotter Half,Or just shoot at night‚Ä¶
My Hotter Half,Stills aren't exactly the ideal way to take them in.
My Hotter Half,"Right, I guess it'd be good to have a disclaimer or something before the show so people know that they might need to adjust their TV settings. Otherwise there are a bunch of upset viewers and posts on Reddit like this one."
My Hotter Half,"Get out of here with that pessimistic shit, thousands of night shots in films and tv has been done well. Perfect? Probably not but considering you pretty much always have to fake it somehow plenty besides nope has done amazing jobs. Even here with HotD if it was just brighter no one would be complaining."
My Hotter Half,"> For my own safety I won't press any further

You weren't even the user they were speaking to in the first place lmao"
My Hotter Half,"As a photographer, legitimately the technology isnt there yet. Yes, if you *have to* shoot in the dark there are ways, but to do that requires you to sacrifice a significant amount of image quality, color quality, dynamic range, framerate, as well as add a ton of noise to the image. Even if you got a future cutting-edge graphene-sensor camera that can take photos in any lightlevel, footage shot at night will *still probably look like dogshit*;  because, either the scene would look true to real life, in which case the audience will barely be able to see shit, or they overexpose the shot, which allows the audience to see but gives the sky and surroundings this weird sickly glow that looks unnatural. You need proper lightsource that *isnt* the dim glow of the sun from behind the horizon to give the shot proper dynamic lighting; You could do that with a bright moon-lit shot, but at that point why not just use the sun during daytime and ramp down the brightness for same effect?"
My Hotter Half,It very much can be said. Look at nope which basically pushed the bar and even then it‚Äôs still noticeable at times that it‚Äôs shot day for night.
My Hotter Half,"Night scenes in most movies and shows have *some* light. Street lights, campfires, etc. 

You can‚Äôt have streetlights in this show. Nor can you have torches or anything else, considering the main point of both scenes was to have people sneaking around in the dark."
My Hotter Half,What‚Äôs the point? All you‚Äôre showing me is a complete lack of understanding or choosing to be ignorant for some weird sense of bitterness towards a tv show not living up to your misinformed expectations. My whole point which you seemed to have missed is it‚Äôs not that simple and having literally unlimited money isn‚Äôt going to stop things like this from happening. Not everyone at all times has access to the best equipment or talent in any given situation no matter the money involved.
My Hotter Half,"You're totally right, it's actually that simple and all these productions are inventing new ways to shoot night time during the day for funzies."
My Hotter Half,Wasn‚Äôt that the issue with The Long Night? The whole episode was filmed in the late hours and remember people complaining how they should‚Äôve shot during the day
My Hotter Half,"Pessimistic?  What?  Dude I think you may have really, really mis-read my post.

Day-for-night is usually fine.  When it is done well it looks good and is not a distraction.

What do you _think_ I'm saying here?"
My Hotter Half,"Stay safe, everybody."
Typewriter,Karl Pilkington doesn't believe this could ever happen
Typewriter,"The BPD is supposed to be an inefficient, overly politicized, shitty police department. Using typewriters is just a symptom of the department's mismanagement.

Later in the series it is revealed that the department has purchased a variety of a high-tech equipment (using Homeland Security grants) that are promptly forgotten about in the store room. "
Typewriter,"Often in organizations like these there are pre-made forms that need to be filled in.  Now, if you have the software set up you can print directly on these forms.  But if you didn't, then you used a typewriter to fill in the forms. "
Typewriter,"Well, let's take into consideration that this was based on the experiences of the creators' from the 80's-90's. Also, they did focus on the budget problems they had- technology of the times was never funded (remember the tennis ball with the bug?).  Not to mention having to work in the basement with desks from the 70's and broken chairs. Prez had to teach all the rest about technology and their technological incapabilities showcased how difficult it was to actually do their job. Sort of the whole point, hence ""The Wire"" as being the title, etc..."
Typewriter,"I was a bit confused when I started watching it, I couldn't tell when the setting was because of the mixed technologies."
Typewriter,It's local government.  They were using nothing but typewriters to fill out forms at my local DMV when I went there in like 2008.
Typewriter,Its set in Baltimore
Typewriter,"The other day I was watching Curb Your Enthusiasm and couldn't believe it when Larry and Jeff ordered a girls gone wild tape and it came in VHS format. Same thing when he injured a basketball player and gave him the complete Seinfeld series on tapes as an apology. 

Can anyone explain that? These episodes aired in the mid 2000s if I'm not mistaken. Why didn't they use DVDs....I mean aren't these people rich as hell?"
Typewriter,"typical sjommelebalaar

Typewriter,"Similarly, there were computers sitting in boxes in the basement of the school.

I swear to god every action, event, setting and line in that series is very deliberate and thought out.
"
Typewriter,"There's a lot of reality in this even now.

I work in an office that works closely with law enforcement. It's 2011 and we *still* have at least one typewriter in the office that receives regular use. From what I've gathered, the office was fairly slow to switch to computers and employees were even slower to adapt. There are also still commonly used triplicate forms that have to either be handwritten or fed through a typewriter. Most of our desks and chairs are 20+ years old and we're cramming three or four times as many people in the same office as it was originally designed for. 

I really need to sit down and watch the rest of the series."
Typewriter,"The episode with Shaquille O'Neil came out in 2001, but Seinfeld did not begin releasing seasons on DVD until 2004. Therefore VHS copies would have been the only available means for Larry to give the episodes to Shaq.

The Girls Gone Wild episode was in 2004, so VHS was right about to go away completely. Larry's not exactly the most adaptable person to change."
Typewriter,"It's pretty obvious that OP just started watching the series. I had the exact same thoughts (typewriters?! pagers?! *jumps on imdb to make sure the first season was 2002*) when I first started. However, 24 hours/episodes later I realized that it was all done on purpose. 

OP will understand it all in about 18 more hours. :D

Typewriter,"It still pisses me off all the faxes that I have to send... trying to stack 50 pages so it doesn't jam the machine!? It makes no sense when I have the .pdf, etc..."
Typewriter,"I have a hard time believing they still sold anything on VHS in 2004. 

Jesus it seems like a lifetime ago. "
Typewriter,I'm pretty sure when the typewriter is introduced Kima comments on how ridiculous it is that they are still using typewriters. 
Typewriter,I have to send faxes for work and our machine only allows one sheet at a time so you have to stand around feeding one after the other.
Typewriter,"I was 14, and I'm not sure we even had a dvd player in my home yet."
Typewriter,"The last VHS's to be sold in America shipped in 2008, but I imagine not many people were buying VHS in 2004. ~32% of Americans owned a VCR in 2005. DVD didn't surpass VHS in rentals until 2003."

Typewriter,"> The filmmaker, who with his brother co-directed movies such as Menace II Society and The Book of Eli, has signed on to direct two episodes of Lionsgate and Starz‚Äôs three-installment event series based on the hit John Wick action movies that star Keanu Reeves.

> Continental, which is set in the unique hotel for assassins in the Wick movies, was initially envisioned as spinoff series but was redeveloped as a three-night event series with movie length and movie budgets. The installments are to run about 90 minutes in length and, according to sources, have budgets upwards of $20 million.


> Hughes will direct the first and third episode while executive producing all three. A director for episode two has not yet been chosen...

> A prequel spinoff, 'Continental' is set 40 years before the events of the Wick series and focuses on a young man named Winston. He will one day grow up to be the character played by Ian McShane in the Wick movies but in the prequel‚Äôs story is a young man starting as a hitman hotelier who, along with others, create a haven for unsavory types, all set against a backdrop of 1970s New York."
Typewriter,So basically a trilogy of continental spinoff tv movies? If that action is anywhere near john wick level good I‚Äôm in.
Typewriter,"I‚Äôm sure this will be cool, but the point of the Continental is that it‚Äôs enigmatic. Mysterious. I don‚Äôt want an origin story explaining it any more than I want a miniseries explaining every assassin‚Äôs backstory.

Let it be. Let people wonder, for fucks sake."
Typewriter,I still wish this was set right before the movies and had an appearance from John Wick but thats just me.
Typewriter,Jesus everything has to be milked for every cent
Typewriter,I didn't realize it would take place that far in the past. I'm not a fan of the 70's aesthetic and I feel like the level of technology wouldn't really be conductive to setting up a world wide assassination network.
Typewriter,Sure would be cool if it had been left as a tv series
Typewriter,I walk by The Continental each day on my way to work. The place is a stones throw away from Wall St. here in NYC
Typewriter,"Sounds good and unheard of. Three night event, movie length, and budgets upwards to $20m."
Typewriter,"The great thing is that they could go everywhere. John Wick is legendary right now, but who knows what beasts were lurking around in the 70s especially pre-Continental. People who were ultimately purged by civility."
Typewriter,"I agree, but I thought of a way it could work.  I'd love to see a Continental show or movie that never leaves the hotel. The proprietors never seem to leave and most of the workers seem to live there too. From their point of view they just see the assassins prep up using their services, then return bloodied and successful (or not). It'd be kinda like Reservoir Dogs, you only see the beginning and the aftermath of different jobs. Almost like the inverse of  the John Wick films."
Typewriter,"I believe there may very well be a flashforward at the end, given early reports did say the character would appear."
Typewriter,This sounds neat. Itd be nice if we could just watch or not watch without trying to whine about money. Everything you watch is made for money get used to it
Typewriter,Well apparently he manages it so well see how.
Typewriter,I mean... 70's technology was conductive enough to set up a non assassination world wide network so I buy it.
Typewriter,In the movies themselves they use typewriters and landline phones... so...
Typewriter,Reminds me of what Netflix just did with the 3 Fear Street movies
Typewriter,Feels like a British model. I'm not sure the budgets of the original Black Mirror or Sherlock series but I enjoyed the 3-episode seasons that had about an hour and a half or so stories for each.
Typewriter,20m per episode right?
Typewriter,I want to see Keanu Reeves as John in his prime.
Typewriter,Not every little detail of every universe needs an origin story or a standalone series. Its such an annoying thing to do and people eat it up.
Typewriter,"It's a great outlet to make these kinds of stories. 

If this wasn't a John Wick prequel, we never would be getting a show with 3x 90 minute episodes with $20,000,000 budgets about a ***super assassin hotel.***

Branching from IP's creates opportunities, it doesn't limit them."
Typewriter,"Because it isn't annoying. Super assassin hotel seems like exactly the kind of thing that would be fun to watch. 

Maybe people eat it up as you say because it's fun to explore world building more and not everyone is a cynical human? Sure it could be bad but I doubt you'll watch to find out and judge accordingly so why have an opinion?

Honestly you're entitled to your opinion but it's really just a cynical issue I think. The first response to every idea in the world should not be that cynical.

This sub is so far up its own ass sometimes without realizing it"

Typewriter,"I love the show, but it's unsettling referring to him as Dick VD."
Typewriter,I believe separate beds was a TV thing because of censors. Though it does give you an idea of what the social mores of the time were since a married couple with a kid couldn't be shown on TV in the same bed.
Typewriter,"Lot of that stuff isn't that old.  My family growing up was lower middle class.  We still used rotary phones in the 90s, typewriters in the 80s, and gathering in front of the tv pretty much until I got to high school."
Typewriter,"> husband and wife sleeping in separate beds

I so wish this was still the standard.  My wife won't have it, and she steals the covers."
Typewriter,"Carl Reiner, Rob‚Äôs father, created the show. He‚Äôs still alive - turns 98 in a couple of weeks.

I grew up in the 70s (when everyone was still using rotary phones and typewriters) and watched the show in reruns."
Typewriter,"The Dick Van Dyke show, The Twilight zone, Alfred Hitchcock presents, What‚Äôs my line. Some of my very favourite shows are black and white from the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs."
Typewriter,"I believe the writers had a rule to not reference anything related to current news, events or politics so I'm not surprised it has aged so well."
Typewriter,"It is remarkable how familiar some of the humor feels even today.   I've only watched a little for historic curiosity and while I found it quite predictable, that's probably because comedy of today is largely based off of things from that era and beyond.  Anyway, it's quite neat."
Typewriter,"It‚Äôs held up well and I try to catch episodes on MeTV on Sunday nights. Like ‚ÄúThe Mary Tyler Moore Show‚Äù, it was perfect from start to finish."
Typewriter,Watching the show right now. I rewatch the entire series once a year.
Typewriter,No one could be shown on tv in bed together. The Flintstones were the first tv couple to sleep together. But married couples slept together in real life.
Typewriter,"I grew up on a bunch of 50s/60s shows- I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, Get Smart, Green Acres, Hogan's Heroes, etc- but for whatever reason didn't watch DVDS. I stumbled on it accidentally on Prime and now it's one of my favorites."
Typewriter,"It makes me happy to see younger people find this show, which absolutely nailed what became standard tropes of sitcoms, and remains funny to this day.

When you're done all 5 seasons you may want to try the Mary Tyler Moore Show, another fantastic sitcom that set the standard for so many shows to come.

And as others have pointed out, the separate beds was a network censorship thing - I seem to recall that Lucy in I Love Lucy was the first time a pregnant woman was shown on tv.  I can't remember now if there was a flashback episode of Dick Van Dyke that showed Laura pregnant, but those capri pants are burned into my memory."
Typewriter,"I avoided it for a long time because I hate the then trend of shows being named after their stars, but I begrudgingly admitted to myself after awhile that some of the best/funniest shows of that era follow that title convention (This one, Andy Griffith, Mary Tyler Moore, Carol Burnett). Still not a fan of it though. I hate when bands do it as well. It's just...uncreative.

But yeah, the more older media I watch the more I realize humans really change very little throughout generations. Only superficial differences exist, like the clothing we wear or the cadence of our speech."
Typewriter,It's our fave! Season 4 only on Hulu for some reason. Check out the classic walnut monster and inflatable boat episodes (ok to watch this show out of order)
Typewriter,"This show was on TV when I was about 14-15 years old (yes I am that old) and I loved it so much. I think when it started it was on Wednesday night on CBS. We had one TV at home, the show was in black and white and there was 3 networks. One season or maybe more I went on Wed night to a church youth meeting and I seldom missed it to watch TV. Even where I lived in Utah, it was broadcast late, 9pm or 930. Sometimes I got home earlier than norma so I could see it but I didn't get to see them all until it was run on CBS in the mornings (on KSL TV) but I'm not sure that happened. It's the one TV show that I bought on DVD in probably the 90s which I lost in a divorce. But I've seen every episode and still find myself watching it on Amazon Prime.

Typewriter,"Great show. Dick Van Dyke's physical comedy is as good as it gets, and Ann Morgan Guilbert was years ahead of her time. That woman could pinch a scene."
Typewriter,"Yeah I found it surprisingly bingeable as well.

Honestly, since I'm not American, I only ever saw it referenced here. But it was talked about so much I thought I'd give it a glance to see what all the fuss is about.

I think I watched 2 series in a weekend. It's great. I must go back and watch the rest."

Typewriter,The censors complained about Mary Tyler Moore‚Äôs undercupping on her Capri pants. The costume fit her buttocks too well for American television.
Typewriter,I‚Äôm solidly middle class and stuff was fairly common up to the 90s. Both sets of grandparents had rotary phones. We would watch TV together.
Typewriter,Thank you for saving me having to point that out.

Typewriter,"I was just thinking of contemporary culture vs the generic past when I made this post. Everybody Loves Raymond still has the whole family gathering in front of the tv. One episode was about Raymond getting an expensive DVD player which now makes it feel old, when that wasn't that long ago. Having said that, I have only seen typewriters in museums and rotary dial phones on the internet!"
Typewriter,That's my goal. People just can't relate to how hard it is to sleep for some other people. Girlfriends I've had act so betrayed when I bring up sleeping in separate beds. If it's a serious thing for you and not just a minor annoyance you might want to have a serious discussion with her.

Typewriter,Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner are both still alive and still very close friends:)
Typewriter,"Carl Reiner is also the last remaining ""star"" in  It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963). He was in the airport scene, not a big role."
Typewriter,"Perry Mason, too."
Typewriter,"> ""probably because comedy of today is largely based off of things from that era and beyond""

For instance: The Krab Borg Spongebob episode clearly drew inspiration from the Dick Van Dyke episode It May Look Like a Walnut, with an exaggerated scary movie informing the next day's events that snowball out of control. 

But unlike with you, connections like this don't leave me liking the originator less, if anything I just tend to see the thing I grew up knowing as less original than I thought and I switch my affections over. It may be fickle but I have a lot of respect not so much for something that was *done* first but something that was *perfected* first."
Typewriter,"Do they broadcast in HD? Cause while the show obviously wasn't filmed in HD or seen in great quality at the time, it looked pretty good when it was on Netflix and certainly better than when I watched it on Nick at Nite back in the day."
Typewriter,munsters also.
Typewriter,">humans really change very little throughout generations

This is true! I was surprised Sally said ""that's 150 calories I don't need anyway"" when her cat ate her food. That sounds so modern to me."
Typewriter,I'm watching it on Amazon Prime! I haven't gotten to the classic walnut monster yet but the inflatable boat episode is one of my favourites. MTM was just so adorable in that episode.
Typewriter,Rose Marie is by far my favourite too! She almost never says a line without me smiling or laughing. Such a special person. I don't think I know any contemporary actress as naturally funny as she was in this show.
Typewriter,"I'm not American as well - it might've been a classic in America but certainly not where I come from at all, I don't think most people even know Dick Van Dyke! I'm so glad to have discovered it!"
Typewriter,"2 episodes. The one where Laura thinks her baby was switched at the hospital, and the one where she accidentally reveals that Alan Brady wears a wig."
Typewriter,I prefer watching in black and white like the people who first watched this show back in the 60's. Colorized shows look odd and artificial to me.
Typewriter,"You might try try checking out ""the Mary Tyler Moore show "" , ground breaking for its time excellent comedy"
Typewriter,Imagine posting something this asinine.
Typewriter,I keep waiting for the reboot roulette wheel to land The Dick Van Dyke Show and give us a show about a lesbian who sells sex toys from the back of an old Ford Econoline.
Typewriter,"They (CBS) actually wanted to keep her out of pants altogether in the beginning. But after a while and a little success, Reiner and crew could do what they wanted.

In fact, speaking of success, CBS wanted season 6 in color, but everyone decided to end it after 5 so the show didn't go downhill."

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Didn‚Äôt even know they were doing something like this. 

It didn‚Äôt look too terrible,  even though I strongly disagree with making Shun a girl (I can understand the why but it‚Äôs maybe one of the worse character to choose to do so).

Hope there gonna be a japanese dub, otherwise it‚Äôs gonna be painful to watch."

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I think Shun being a girl is a missed opportunity.

His brother, Ikki, should have been the girl. Shun could stay the way he always was and every time he asked for help he would be asking his SISTER to come to the rescue instead of her BROTHER.

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Didnt this use to be a Anime series from back in the day that played on Fox Kids or CN or something? I know iv seen this before.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,I'll pass. I'm not big into CGI and the Knights of Sidonea really left a bad taste in my mouth for Netflix created anime. 
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Man, Operation Desert Storm was a lot different than I remember."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"It's amazing that despite the fact that anime has gone so mainstream, mainstream media companies *still* have no idea how to license or adapt anime properties."

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,If it was really successful in Japan why was the dub considered crappy here? Bad voice work?

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"saint seiya is a super successful anime in japan

a dub called knights of the zodiac ran for a season on cartooj netqork and was cancelled for sucking ass"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Yes, it's a classic anime from the 80s."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Are you thinking of Ronin Warriors?
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Anime is mainstream?
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Pretty sure Netflix only has the exclusive streaming rights for this. They had no creative control, just like pretty much all their other anime."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Doubtful the female knight still wore a mask where Shun didn't
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"What agenda? And in the same way, whsts wrong with shun being a girl?"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Are we sure?

Female knights have to wear a facemask and Shun doesn't in the trailer. Maybe they gave boobs to the armor because his constellation is Andromeda (a woman)."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Who cares? What's the agenda that they are pushing? It's a fictional character, it's gender could be Apache attack helicopter, it doesn't matter as long as the writing is good."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Saint Seiya is really successful in Japan, Europe and Latin America. Apparently the US dub was extremely bad. "
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"it's a fighting anime that was HEAVILY censored, even in comparison to shows like DBZ that were currently airing. 

""edits made to this dub included cutting overly violent scenes, adding in previously non-existent digital scene transitions, coloring all instances of blood blue and renaming it ""magical energies,"" rewriting the scripts, renaming several characters, and replacing the opening theme, ending theme, background music, and sound effects.""

It also was kind of hard to market, and they didn't do so well. They sold it as a big epic show and while it does become that, the first season is mostly about grappling fights in a tournament between the main characters. Between that and how cleaned up it was, the young audience turned back to the 100 other animes airing and the older audience laughed at it. "
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"It seems that you're talking about the first American dub made by DiC which was censored a lot.

It did get an uncut version by ADV which is a lot more faithful to the Japanese script. It still wasn't as successful."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I don't think this is even a Japanese production. The original Saint Seiya was Japanese, but this reboot/reimagining looks super western to me."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Then why don't they create an actual anime instead of a western 3-D animated series? Other than being based on a Japanese property, there's next to nothing aesthetically Japanese about this. "
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I think this is a short sighted attitude to take. Shuns gender is not pivotal to the character, whether Andromeda is a man or a woman makes no difference as long as the show is good.

Edit: folks it is your right to down vote, all I respectfully ask is if you do down vote to articulate your reasoning, thanks!"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"First, it‚Äôs easy in the way it play with the clich√© : the guy has a pink armor representing a girl, he look/act like a girl, so let‚Äôs make him a girl. I was around 8 years old at the french release of St Seiya and that what I, as many if I remember correctly, though then.

Second, Shun, he‚Äôs actually the only of the five bronze Saint that goes away from that ""man must be tough"" male model but still manage to be a strong Saint in the end.

Third, what it‚Äôs gonna looks like the numerous time Ikki come to the rescue of Shun. The girl can‚Äôt defend herself and need the big strong man?

I‚Äôm all for inclusiveness but that have to be done sensibly wich doesn‚Äôt seems to have been the case here. The guy that looked like a girl became a girl and now, that girl will be see first as more weak and in need of a man.

Personally, I think Cygnus would have been a great choice, that would have made a strong female saint equal to the other with little change.

Ikki would have worked too and here, with Shun, you actually would have reversed the girl need a man thing and had Shun saved by his big sister. You could also change the two brothers, that would balance a lot a thing (my point 3 would not exist and point 1 would be minor).

Shiryu, with his Shunrei love story, that would have been more complicated but that could work.

Seiya, I wouldn‚Äôt have minded but too controversial."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,At first I was but i do remember this one two because of the armor power up being the gold pegasus armor well Ronin main up grade was white armor
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Compared to what it was a decade ago? Yeah. I said ""despite the fact that it has gone *so* mainstream."" That's a relative statement comparing its mainstream appeal now to what it had in the past."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Because in the original Shun was written as a bishonen. Some of his interaction with other characters is based on that trope. It won't work as well if he become a she. It's like changing Sasuke into a woman or Sakura into a man (in Naruto).
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Normally it wouldn't matter but shun in particular, it's a big fuck up for both sides"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,It's not that they haven't created actual anime. There is Devilman Crybaby and B The Beginning. 
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I disagree.

Now they have a bunch of gungho male saints and, oh what a coincidence, one female saint who is the opposite of the other main protagonists. Shun's gentleness/kindness/etc in spite of his gender might now be seen as being because of her gender.

Unless they completely change Shun's character to avoid that stereotype, but then that's as pivotal of a change as it gets.

And by your own logic, why change his gender if it makes no difference as long as the show is good?"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Thanks for your thoughts.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"100% Agree Shiryu or Ikki would have been great as female saints.
"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"That makes absolutely no sense, shuns character doesn't change at all if you change his gender, Sakura and Sasuke do only because of their sexual orientation. 

And saying it ""was written as a bishonen"" is really fucking stupid, then again, there's no point with arguing with people on the level of ""Netflix's agenda"" lol"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Not really, as long as the show is good. If it isn't, then they have bigger problems on their hands."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"They didn't make either of those. B The Beginning is Studio I.G. and Devilman Crybaby is Science Saru. Netflix just writes ""Netflix Original"" if they have the exclusive North American distribution license. It's totally misleading and as false as if Funimation called One Piece their ""original series."""
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I mean, nobody objected when they did it to Pidge."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Because it's a new show, and they are trying to update it. As the writer points out these kind of changes can work very well as it did for Battlestar Galactica. Of course it is up to you as the consumer to decide whether to watch it, but it's pretty silly to complain about any fictional characters gender being changed as long as their gender isn't central to the plot. I think we both agree that the only thing that matters is if it is good, it wouldn't matter at all if they changed every saint into a woman if the show is good, right?"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Bishonen is a staple in manga/anime culture. It's actually a very big deal. The yaoi vibe will be gone without Shun being an androgynous man. 

They can change Seiya or Shiryu gender for all I care. Their character tropes aren't gender specific so it doesn't change much. But Shun must be a bishonen.

Btw, in Sakura and Sasuke gender switch, sexual orientation is not a problem. Sakura must be a woman because her core character is a personification of feminism. She's written for teenage girls to look up to. As such she started like the average teenagers drooling over boys and such but grows into a capable and independent woman.

If Sasuke were to switch gender, his whole dynamic with Naruto or his brother will not work at all and the whole story will fall apart."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,I will never understand people who get super invested in a fictional characters race or gender. 
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,[deleted]
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"But of all characters, they change shun?! Like I dont think you understand the implications, they took some who defied gender norm (pacifist, emotional, sensitive and wears pink armor) to someone that would become a stereotype. The only way to prevent the character from becoming a stereotype is to rewrite the character and at that point, it's a completely new character. That affects the plot significantly "
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Because shun was the guy who defied gender norms and changing to a female makes the character a stereotype 
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"No, not the same at all. Bojack is a show that Netflix has the exclusive rights to in its country of origin. They may even have the authority to sell international rights to third parties outside the US. This stands in stark contrast to anime series that are controlled by a different company in their country of origin, and which Netflix has only licensed for north American distribution. "
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I think you are making a lot of assumptions over a show you haven't watched yet. Shun can still defy gender norms as a woman, and you're right it's a new show so the storyline will change. That's fine, if the show is good. Do you agree that's all that matters in the end, that it is good and entertaining?"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,You can't really say that about a character on a show you haven't seen. 
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Not really since basically taking away a beloved character is going to rub people the wrong way
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,It's the equivalent of changing the Tom boy character into a man
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Oh lord, what is that? The animation looks awful."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Yeeeah, I refuse to watch this in any language that isn't Spanish.

Also, why are the Bronze Saints fighting the military?"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Wow.  Graphically it looks pretty damn bad; those dead, dead eyes everywhere.  And the voice acting is pretty bad sounding, too.

I want to give the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were *trying* to make it look ""retro"" or something, but it looks way too far in the wrong direction.  I know the original is kinda a thing for a lot of people, so I'll probably give it a shot, but wow.  This doesn't even look like it compares with the quality of similar Trollhunters/3Below shows."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,That CGI animation is actually great here.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I used to live in Southern Utah and I would see them all the time at Walmart. The women were dressed in Little House on the Prarie garb and the men wore jeans and long sleeved flannel shirts. They refused to speak to you, wouldn't look at you. All were on food stamps, but drove big nice cars.

Made my skin crawl whenever I saw them because you knew what was happening."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,It was unbelievably disgusting. and the most disgusting part is how many individuals and law enforcement agencies conspired to cover this up and facilitate the crimes.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"There was a show on A&E called Escaping Polygamy that did a lot of work with people trying to get out of the FLDS/AUB community. The level of loyalty to Warren Jeffs was insane; one episode had a young woman packing to leave and she had to take his picture in her belongings. 

This show was well done. Episode four went hard with the evidence; I can't imagine being on that jury and having to hear the recordings."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Ugh this was way grosser than I even expected it to be. ü§Æ
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,One part highlighted that it was all human trafficking underage girls sold or exchanged between the older men to be abused. While young boys sold into construction labour across the US while the church gets a lot of the money. I wonder how much that still goes on
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Why is it religious cults are usually just a way for ugly dudes to get laid
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Just watched t last night and it‚Äôs so sad how many people decided to stay even after their leader was out in prison and the tapes of him raping a 12 old while a bunch of ladies watched came out

When the news guy who helped break the case was almost in tears describing the mostly female jurors reactions"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"It was very disturbing, but interesting. I‚Äôve always had a deep interest in cults and the FLDS has always been one that just blows my mind every time. The stuff I heard in this documentary was absolutely disgusting and sad. The worst part was hearing that audio of that little girl being raped. There were other women in the room watching it happen. Just vile. They are so brainwashed and they don‚Äôt see how fucked up they are."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"When they played that disgusting audio at the end of pt.4 I was filled with an intense rage. 

How anyone can subject their 12 year old daughter to that is mind boggling."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,The documentary is very good and very sad when they interview the women who escaped. Men sold their young daughters and businesses to the prophet to have more wives. Then they were blackballed if they were seen as a threat or if the prophet felt intimidated by them. Then their wives and children were rehoused with someone else. The FLDS uses unpaid labor of young unmarried boys and young men to fulfill construction contractions for Walmart and Amazon. When there weren‚Äôt enough young girls to go around they‚Äôd send off the compound with no money and excommunicate them too.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,I wish we knew more of the life updates on some of the people they interviewed.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,[Reminder: Tucker Carlson thinks Warren Jeffs should be a free man.](https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/03/11/tucker-carlson-wont/)
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"‚ÄúUnder the Banner of Heaven‚Äù touched on fundamentalists Mormons too. It was an interesting miniseries because throughout the main murder plot they would have historical retelling of the Mormon founders. Not sure I want to watch another 4 hour of FLDS nutcases though.

Edit: The show stars the Amazing Spiderman actor as a practicing Mormon detective undergoing an existential crises while trying to solve a murder in 80s Utah, he‚Äôs gave a great performance. Apparently based on a true story. It‚Äôs on Hulu and the last episode aired recently so you can binge the whole thing, it wasn‚Äôt too long. Pretty good."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,women are so SMART even when the odds are stacked against them. watching the episode now where the woman was saying she wrote down the mileage on her husbands car and tracked the mud to find zion are you kidding me????
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Got a flat tire in Colorado city on my way to work once. It was terrifying. People won‚Äôt even make eye contact with you and there is no cell service. It‚Äôs just a surreal place. All the homes are unfinished to save on taxes.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"It's basically the Elite fundamentalist getting to choose any woman they fancy having, then disowning young boys and men because they serve no purpose to their religion. Nobody will have the guts to question it because they want to go to heaven. I mean how do you allow somebody to rape underage girls infront of you and then not say a word to anybody or a mother allowing their 14 year old to get married."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,The weird ceremonial room in the temple with the bed made me feel sick. Unbelievably horrific.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I grew up in the sister community to Colorado city. Warren Jeff's was caught, but the religion is still going on under a new high priest council. Placement marriage and polygamy are still common practice, trying to get girls married and child bearing the second they turn eighteen. Sometimes before. My dad has four wives, one of whom is a few years older than me. It's still going and it's still fucked"

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"By far the most disturbing thing I have seen to date. It was very well done. That said, I could have done without the audio. I am scarred for life."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Orthodox Jewish communities also depend on welfare benefits. Small communities in NY take up a high percentage of the state's entire budget for benefits. The men study the bible full time and rarely work. Women work as well as are the caretakers. 

Religions have often exploited women. Patriarchy and power are the actual religion."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"The most difficult part for me was watching the interviews of former members who had willingly participated as adults.

Like so many of them seemed so self-righteous as they spoke about Warren and all of the things that had occured in the community like...y'all participated in it.

You married off your daughters to old, musty men and allowed your sons to be assaulted/raped and thrown out like garbage...and then sit there and brag about having a ""happy"" 30 years of marriage with your wives and complain about having ""my guns taken away."" 

Even the ones that I felt bad for - Alicia etc. Why in the *world* would you stay after being ""reassigned"" a husband TWICE and then having your children snatched away for a year? Ridiculous.

I was also astounded to see just how recent a lot of their defection was. 2012 and 2015 was not at all long ago which made me so unbelievably sad for everyone involved. I was thinking they had all left like 15-20 years ago...for some of them its barely been 10."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,This was so infuriating to watch albeit a good doc. Warren Jeffs is a cold ugly man and I hope the fucker is having a horrible time in jail
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"I actually thought the doc was pretty tame. I've read several of the memoirs by some of the participants, and the details in them were pretty horrific."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Reading the article was disturbing enough for me, but this story deserves to be told."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Watching this right now. Disturbing!

‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"This guy was the most dangerous gangster in America. Crooked cops covering his crimes, massive child abuse and trafficking, forced labor - absolutely insane. I knew about the sexual assaults but the scale of this cult‚Äôs power is almost unbelievable."
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,"Tucker Carlson also famously defended Warren Jeffs in a radio interview because he ""might be a child rapist, but he plans to take care of them for the rest of their lives"" as if that makes it somehow less worse"
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,Last Podcast gets into Warren Jeffs a bit on their Mormonism series. Sent me down a crazy rabbit hole.
‚ÄãSAINT SEIYA: Knights of the Zodiac,When will we actually have the balls to say ‚Äú this is not a religion but a cult of pedophiles‚Äù they want to have a harem of underage girls to pick and choose from. The whole thing is disgusting.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"""Did he get EP?‚Äú

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,They never made a legitimate season 1.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with ‚ÄúMoney for Nothing‚Äù? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I‚Äôm in.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,This show was‚Ä¶ not good.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don‚Äôt get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would‚Äôve enjoyed it more if it didn‚Äôt have the ‚ÄúWillow‚Äù label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn‚Äôt feed off the world the original movie built.

I‚Äôm all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can‚Äôt believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"It was ‚Ä¶ ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,But it‚Äôs so awful
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Won‚Äôt cry when they cancel it. It‚Äôs like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I didn‚Äôt even make it past the first episode.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I wouldn't bet on it.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Let‚Äôs do a Legend series instead
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven‚Äôt felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,This needs to be cancelled.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the ‚ÄúWomen aren‚Äôt accepted as fighters/knights,‚Äù thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I‚Äôm sorry kid, I guess I should have named you ‚ÄúMaze Runner Divergent.‚Äù"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn‚Äôt rewatch the movie beforehand so it‚Äôs probably been 15 years since I‚Äôve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random ‚Äúwtf‚Äù moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won‚Äôt shed a tear if the show doesn‚Äôt get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it‚Äôs Willow.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,this show needs to not be renewed.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying ‚Äúuuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!‚Äù to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn‚Äôt like the series genuinely didn‚Äôt like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn‚Äôt like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"There‚Äôs either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can‚Äôt quite figure out which."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it‚Äôs obsessed with modern politics over story once it‚Äôs out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn‚Äôt meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn‚Äôt that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Good luck with that Ron.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,It‚Äôs an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Does he have COVID?
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
A Certain Scientific Accelerator,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.
Bem,I remember seeing this show on cable as a young teen but never watched it. Was Sorbo as hardcore with his wingnuttery back then as he is now? Age I find either mellows out or reforges a zealot.
Bem,"Honestly the original showrunner left IIRC because Sorbo and others wanted the show to be more about Dylan Hunt, who was one of the least interesting characters in the group.  The show inevitably declined after that.  The last season was pretty much unwatchable."
Bem,First 1.5 season is as good as most 'heroic' space opera can get. Then things get weird and/or not good after the original creator leaves the show.
Bem,What they did to Trance and Rev Bem is unforgivable...
Bem,"There's great ideas in the show, and the cast minus Sorbo was great. I love the far future premise without any real connection to Earth. Wish the IP would get rebooted.

Also, Andromeda is clearly the sexiest spaceship to ever grace TV."
Bem,"Man. This show still holds a special place in my heart despite its variable quality. It was more or less my first fandom. I actually liked the 5th season more than the 4th because at least they were trying some new things.

 I don't remember his trysts being as frequent as you mentioned, but I do remember feeling scandalized each time they happened because I misinterpreted the episode where he's able to talk with his wife through a black hole as proof they were each other's one true loves, not as closure for their relationship so so it would be ok for him to start seeing other people"
Bem,Show would be have been great if Kevin Sorbo wasn't a self absorbed hack.
Bem,makes you remember when Sorbo wasn't making shitty Christian movies.
Bem,"Tyr Anasazi was probably my favorite character, and he also was marginalized towards the end. I never finished the show, even though I didn't really know about the behind-the-scenes change, something went wrong and it wasn't worth trying to figure out when the next season would appear on German TV.

About Dylan Hunts women stories: I guess Dylan Hunt was written like Kirk - and not the real TOS Kirk, but pop culture Kirk that is just some horndog? I dunno. 

The show had a lot of interesting ideas, even if it didn't execute them all well."
Bem,Didn't know that Misogyny goes against Christian beliefs.
Bem,"I loved that show as a kid. Where did you manage to rewatch it? 
I recently wanted to watch it again but foud only lowres versions.. is it still airing somewhere?"
Bem,"Sorbo is such a C-grade actor. 

>The fact that he is also the executive producer shows that he had control over these scripts. Every time I see him making out with a half naked woman I wonder how that fits into his Christian values.

One of them was his wife or ended up being his wife. Not sure when they married, so...nepotism, or casting couch?"
Bem,"Tyr's best line in the whole show:

""That's my, BOY!!!!""

If you know, you know."
Bem,Change the channel‚Ä¶.?
Bem,"I like the show. I liked how they applied some real science to some scenes. I recall they were watching another ship get destroyed and wanted to help but they were like 2 light minutes away meaning the ship was already destroyed when they were able to see it getting attacked.  
  
I think Firefly was probably a lot better but short lived.  
  
As for the sex, well what guy doesn't dream about flying through space sitting in an ottoman and watching a big screen tv while banging a different hot alien every night? Bottom line is sex sell and the target audience is men.  
  
And this doesn't have to be just sci-fi shows. Every show, doctors, lawyers, whatever the sitcom or drama show is, there is sex."
Bem,Well don‚Äôt watch old original tv show called Star Trek
Bem,"The problem with scifi is that in order for it to be popular you have to have baywatch and relationship drama thrown in. Imagine Battlestar Galactica without all the ""who's sleeping with whom"" and ""how are we going to save this relationship that's on the rocks all the time"" nonsense. 

I mean... it would be better, but so many fewer people would watch it. It's like imagining TWD without humans constantly trying to fuck each other over. Imagine a zombie show that was even remotely realistic. ""are you human?"" ""Yeah."" ""OK, come inside, there's a gun and some food over there. Tomorrow we're raiding a costco so get some sleep."" ""Thanks man, zombies suck."" 

There'd be no tension in that part of the storyline. In real life it would be ""I don't care that you're sleeping with my ex wife there are literally zombies trying to eat us."""
Bem,"Totally agree, far too much 1960s captain Kirk womenising used. Its actually gringeworthy and detracts from Dillon's integrity completely."
Bem,"Yes, the show went to shit thanks to Sorbo. He forced out exec producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe, to make the show more focused on his character. So less story arc, and more... Sorbo bangs the female guest star in every episode."
Bem,"I remember it as a teen too, cleavages were mandatory in the wardrobe department."
Bem,"Not trying to apologize for the guy, but Didn‚Äôt he finally admit to having a series of strokes or brain hemorrhages back during his Hercules days that went untreated? I think the guy might actually be dealing with some personality changes that are common after events like that."
Bem,"Hollywood freaking went off on him for saying he wanted to fight government waste.  That doesn't make someone a ""wingnut."""
Bem,Are you referring to the ship or the avatar?  Either way I can't disagree.  I always thought Trance was more attractive but that probably personality based. Or I just like the color purple.
Bem,"Well good news! It looks like discovery is just ripping off all of andromeda‚Äôs plot points including the fall of the federation, the timelost ship from the golden age and rebuilding the commonwealth errr federation."
Bem,But he is so handsome.  I watched all of the seasons on IMDb just for him.
Bem,"But not all bad since he, like Kirk Cameron that does the same, is so handsome."
Bem,"Well that depends. Are we talking actually following the teachings Christ or what Christianity has turned into after 2,000 years without him?

Sorbo and his ilk definitely fall within the latter."
Bem,"Fornication has always been against Christian teachings, as you no doubt know."
Bem,I think it might still be streaming on the Roku Channel.
Bem,I am watching it on IMDB and it is also on some of the other free streaming services.
Bem,It‚Äôs on Amazon Prime in the UK. It used to be only in the early morning on ITV back in the early 00s I‚Äôd watch it before Cybernet while half asleep and remember it being good fun for the first couple of seasons.
Bem,Nepotism. They were married before Andromeda began.
Bem,Didn't know until recently.   Not only do I like the character I find the actor very talented.
Bem,I am a huge Trek fan and I am old enough to remember when there was only an original.  If TOS was produced 35 years later I am sure Kirk would have had more lurid sex scenes.  Trek was pretty calm compared to Andromeda.
Bem,"Well here's the thing: Going back
to George Romero, the zombies were never really the point of the story. It was always a social commentary on how people are just bastards who refuse to cooperate, even when they really need it the most. 

I used to roll my eyes at this stuff, because I felt like it was such a biased point of view... but then I saw stuff like the current pandemic, politics, income inequality, the way everyone treats the homeless, etc. Then I realized he was actually right. Everything really would be easier if we just worked together, but it's like people actually go out of their way not to. I still don't get it, but it's a real issue."
Bem,"I mean every story at it's core is about the characters and the relationships they have with each other. I hate when writers drama mine romance relationships because they're lazy, but romance is as important as any other part of a genre. 

Also no one is inviting random people into their group during a zombie apocalypse, you kill them and steal their stuff."
Bem,"The book *World War Z* brilliantly plays with this kind of cooperative ideas. 

Sadly the movie did not. They totally destroyed a great source IP. What a waste."
Bem,"Maybe it was the writing with Andromeda because the love scenes in Battlestar seemed more realistic. I don't know how much input Sorbo had with his love scenes but the other characters occasional love interests seem more natural.  

You have much more faith in humanity than I do when it comes to a zombie attack.  I think humans do really good job when there is an initial crisis but when that crisis lasts for any length of time we become tribal. I have to admit I stopped watching TWD after the 5th season because they went over the top on the tribalism."
Bem,Way to live out his William Shatner fantasy.
Bem,"Yep, just what I was about to say. Wolfe had a whole story arc planned which basically went right out the window after he was forced to leave during the second season, and the show started dropping."
Bem,This needs to brought up every time any one discusses Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda.
Bem,Didn't they fire a bunch of the writers as well?
Bem,"Definitely both.

Trance is definitely the hottest stellar object, but hard to compare against other franchises."
Bem,"Never could get into anything in the Star Trek franchise, and Discovery is pretty bad"
Bem,"But isn't Keith Hamilton Cobb handsome, too? And he was practically written out of the show for more of Sorbo's ego..."
Bem,"""Christian"" is more about Paul, the first nutjob evangelist and his books, than Jesus' sayings."
Bem,"Both a strict textualist interpretation where women are subservient and lesser, or the modern interpretation of the chaste and delicate woman creature."
Bem,http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/women/long.html
Bem,"It is completely free on IMDb!  The ads though are just annoying.

And, the last season is the best season since they replaced Lexa Dog with the beautiful Doyle."
Bem,"It is completely free on IMDb!  The ads though are just annoying.

And, the last season is the best season since they replaced Lexa Dog with the beautiful Doyle."
Bem,What in the hell is wanting to help your wife?
Bem,"Yeah but this isn't the zombie apocalypse. I liked how Aliens had Burke, who represented the one asshole who would actually try to fuck you over in face of alien death. But he was one person, not everyone. 

Sure, people aren't going to suddenly be harmonious and saints all of a sudden, but all the shit you see now with politics, the pandemic, income inequality, that shit would mostly melt away. And the few assholes who were like ""we're going to raid people"" would take 1 loss... then 1 guy would get shot with no doctor..... then another guy would die... and how do you recruit for a group like that? 

At what point do you get people to decide that they are going to have such unwavering allegiance to being evil, murderous shitbags when the alternative is literally joining a community and being far more safe? 

Not saying there wouldn't be shitbags, but these large organizations of ""Evil Corp"" bad guys wouldn't even remotely exist. The logistics just don't make sense."
Bem,"Yeah, that's what TV tells you to do. How long do you think that's sustainable? How many fights with other humans are going to result in one of yours dying or being injured with little to no antibiotics. What happens when you run into the large group that does work together. 

It pisses me off that every video game and TV series has stupid humans who learned about survival by playing Day Z and watching TWD. Like... you're already dying like flies you want to go make more opportunities to get hurt or die? For what? A 4th shotgun?"
Bem,Gee it'd be nice to have a conversation like this in r/television instead of a bunch of left wing nutjob cultists promoting their crazy worldview visa vis mask arguments and shit.
Bem,"I think the early days there would probably be a lot more tribalism, because there'd be the thought ""we need these supplies to get through it."" 

There's a series called ""Black Summer"" that is just the epitome of what I'm talking about. The only saving grace is that all the stupid decisions like storming houses and having gunfights they don't need to seem to have catastrophic consequences. It also appears that they may be adding in a ""we're starving"" aspect to it, which actually would cause more tribalism, but there's no actual discussion and food seems easy enough to find. 

People do get pretty brutal when the food runs out."
Bem,Don't. CAAARE. Had. SEX.
Bem,u/curnonutah Wolfe wrote a one act play after the series ended which describes in basic terms what the original plan for the series would've been [https://andromeda.fandom.com/wiki/Coda](https://andromeda.fandom.com/wiki/Coda)
Bem,">Doyle

Brandy Ledford is so pretty."
Bem,I wouldn't mind the ads if they were not the same ads over and over again.  Car insurance and ACA are the only ads I get.   I already have Progressive and I don't qualify for ACA.   Next ad please.
Bem,We have people refusing to wear a piece of cloth over their mouth to help each other. You think they're going to hold hands and sing together when resources become scarce. Majority of humanity is trash.
Bem,"I have watched lots of zombie shows and movies.  In most of them the human population has been nearly destroyed.   If that was the case there would be enormous amount of can foods for at least the first few years.   I used to think this would be long enough to start one's own garden but after gardening for my first time this year I know I would be eating can goods until I starved to death.   

I am a huge daydreamer.   I often put myself in the position of a survivor or a starship employee (never the captain).   I am not a prude by any means.  I certainly wouldn't be having sex while running from zombies and I don't think I would trust aliens enough to drop my pants."
Bem,"I've seen it. It's definitely interesting, although I'm skeptical about some of the elements. I mean, the ""Consensus of Parts"" as seen in the first season would have been best forgotten about in the long run. A lot of it, I suppose, would have depended on the execution. But I'd have been perfectly happy with not every member of the crew turning out to be a superhuman leader of the future."
Bem,"OMG.. yes, those are totally the same thing. 

But I'll tell you what. Seeing the Trump cult and the ""progress cult"" talk, as if they're so fucking smart, have everything figured out and they're the only good guys in the world full of evil people, maybe I should consider you may have a point. 

If people actually believe that the petty bullshit argument over masks, equals murdering other people, maybe they WOULD murder other people. Maybe it won't take the zombie apocalypse for that to happen. Maybe ""Progress cult"" will keep nutting up like the lady that attacked a mom and kid in an elevator because of the perceived threat of the Delta variant. 

Maybe the crazy, murderous, brainwashed zealots of evil are already here and they're going to political rallies LOL!"
Bem,"The idea behind movies, books, TV shows for me is to escape ordinary life. But the politics of BSG was just... ugh. Sadly too realistic in some episodes, and sadly too ""I can tell what decade this was made in and the political affiliation of the writers"" in others. Just straight up ""we're going to foist our ridiculous religion/political opinion on you now, hope you didn't think people would ever grow out of this."" 

This is why I liked Star Trek more. It was less obvious, beat you over the head, with their preachy political nonsense. And the Star Trek political leaning was always more technology, freedom from oppression and inclusion than it was the very cringy specific politics of the time. I can get behind an inclusive, technocracy, meritocracy that values personal freedoms highly. What I love about Star Trek is that they preach tolerance and are actually tolerant. They don't try to find loopholes. ""Oh well tolerance of intolerance is..."" No, fuck you. That's not how it works. Just because YOU say they're intolerant doesn't mean that they are. So yeah, you're being straight up hypocritical. 

If they label all black people as ""Intolerant"" and then go on to attack them, that's fucking racism. You're not special or magic. Your opinions aren't rainbows that fly out of your asshole, they're shit, just like everyone else's. 

In Star Trek people would do obnoxious stuff all the time and the crew would bitch about it, but they'd put up with it because that's what fucking tolerance means. I'm sure there were examples that go against it but mostly that's what they did. 

I don't want your stupid political bullshit in my movie or TV show about somewhere or some place or some time else. Fuck off. I cannot overstate this."
Bem,Sure. I still love the idea of the inversion of classic heaven/angels vs hell/demon imagery mixed with big bang cycle cosmology.
Bem,"When I made this post I was concerned that it may lead to political discourse but I didn't quite see it going here.   I do see some comparisons however mild of the zombie apocalypse and our current pandemic.  There are zealots on both sides. They are loud but even when added together don't outnumber the rest of us.   

I used to be a political news junky but after the election of The Person Who Will Remain Nameless I realized that it wasn't good for my mental health."
Bem,"That itself was definitely cool, and a great twist. The idea that the ""demons"" are responsible for everything we know existing, and that the fairly horrifying antagonists are actually the ""angel"" role, is genuinely innovative."
Bem,"Political news in the west is a joke now. EU/UK/US that's not news, that's pure brainwashing now. 

""The president cut the bread off his sandwich... LIKE A RACIST!"" Everything Biden does, or Trump did, or Obama did was either the 2nd coming of the Messiah or the Resurrection of Hitler. Everything was spun so wildly out of control and people eat it up."
Bem,"It's not innovative at all. It's literally gnostic cosmology and is hundreds of years old. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demiurge

> In the arch-dualist ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is malevolent, as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of Valentinus, the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided."
Bem,This is probably a comment for a different thread but I will write it anyway.  When I was a kid we had 30 minutes of the nightly news.  The big anchor at that time was Walter Cronkite.   There just wasn't enough time to cover the world news and put much of a spin on it.   24/7 news channels are big business that have to fill in segments that keep people watching.    This is a case where more is not better.
Bem,"It's innovative compared to common plays, both straight and subverted, on heroic and villainous motivations. You can of course look at ANY idea put forward and find some similarity to something else. That's the nature of thousands of years of human conceptualization."
Bem,"That is not the same thing, tbh."
Bem,"Fucking Amen. 

I generally fucking hate people, especially these days but every now and then a comment like this makes me want to hug a stranger."
Bem,Glad I made your day.   I stopped watching cable news almost a year ago.  I had cut back quite a bit before that.   I allow myself 15 minutes of national news that I get from CBS a day.  Told my roommate if aliens attack the planet to let me know.   I have gone days without watching any news lately and I feel so much better.
Bem,Amen brother.
Bem,"Annoying that they are sunsetting it. It works much better on my family Samsung smart TV than YouTube does. Much better quality and less cluttered / crappy. 

I wish Google would stop killing stuff off. I'd fall back on the old ""I'd gladly pay for it!"" but in the case of GPM&TV I quite literally did pay for it by buying movies for it.

EDIT: Oh, and YouTube music sucks compared to Google Play Music, and compared to everything. I miss Google Play Music."
Bem,"And if you don't want to use YouTube, remember to sign up for Movie Anywhere to get those movies on your Vudu, iTunes (Apple TV), and Microsoft (Xbox) accounts.  Though, some studios, it won't work for as they aren't partnered, like Lionsgate is one that isn't.

Bem,"The still cap the quality at 480p when you watch on a PC, even if you've bought the 4K version. Cunts."
Bem,"Weirdly just today I noticed a new thing on my Android TV - a button that offers a direct link to ""streaming channels"". So I clicked it: It doesn't take you to Netflix, or Amazon TV, or Hulu. It takes you to a blank page with ""Google Play Movies and TV"" at the top and does nothing but play random trailers for new films it wants you to pay to rent - trailers you can't click out of because whoever made this feature was retarded.

I'd be more surprised that Google are cancelling whatever the fuck this is if I hadn't already been through their decision to remove Google Play Music and replace it with the relentless epic shittiness of Youtube Music."
Bem,"Google TV is just an update to Google Play Movies. All of your content is still there and you can continue to purchase through it just the same.

Nothing has shut down."
Bem,"I loved Google Play Music, but once they forced me onto an imitation of Spotify I cancelled and just made the switch to Spotify."
Bem,it's a shame that Movies Anywhere is not available in Australia. :(
Bem,"Awesome.

Edit: I misread that and then enthusiastically commented on this comment that movies anywhere is great too so obviously I'm blind and silly."
Bem,"I remember downloading a prior version of the app so I didn't have all that radio garbage. I just used mine as a music locker of my actual music, so that got to be a shitshow so quick. You couldn't tell what was your music, etc."

Unrequited Love,"I have my opinions about how off the rails they went after Change Your Mind (Even a slight reworking of Reunited to tie up some loose ends really would make a good finale) but the show at its peak really meant the world to me for awhile and a special room in my heart is reserved for SU at its best. 

Like I'm actually *not* a fan of how hindsight makes Pearl seem like a codependent mess here as opposed to someone who suffered a genuine loss that stings all the more because her feelings were unrequited, but as the latter it really is top notch. I was *heartbroken* for her when I first saw this, and Mr. Greg is still my favorite episode."
Unrequited Love,"It's such a complex situation... Most shows couldn't do it well, if they dared even touch it... Most viewers probably haven't experienced anything like it. I certainly haven't. 

And along comes this kids cartoon that absolutely nails it with a 2.5 minute song and dance number. Wow. This episode gave me a whole new appreciation of Pearl. 

I almost decided not to watch the show at the last minute because it looked too childish. It's one of the best things I've ever seen."
Unrequited Love,"That is my favourite episode. Live the entire show and future especially, but It's Over, Isn't It broke me. Outstanding song."
Unrequited Love,"Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon, up to the Adventure Time Alzheimer‚Äôs allegory and Hey Arnold‚Äôs parental neglect in Helga‚Äôs therapy episode. This was the height of SU as a show, and was a major tearjerker in the context of the show."
Unrequited Love,"My friend showed me this once, and having never seen the show, I had zero context for this song. And yet it still brought a tear to my eye. There was no way I was gonna pass on the show after that."
Unrequited Love,That show as full of banger songs tbh.
Unrequited Love,"What makes it worse is that she didn't really die, she's technically still there, just changed beyond recognition. This means Pearl has never been able to properly mourn or let go. Maybe she'd been hoping she'd come back some day, but every time she'd look at Steven all she could see was the crystal that used to be her friend."
Unrequited Love,Wow. Never seen the show but this makes me want to watch. This is beautifully melancholy.
Unrequited Love,It's my second favorite SU song. Pearl is so raw and real and open about how she feels. My heart hurt so bad for Greg and Steven but Pearl.... They had thousands of years together and then Rose was just gone and all that was left was little Steven. And despite all the pain Pearl was there for her son. Fricking love Pearl and Steven Universe.
Unrequited Love,"‚ÄúNow I have to be there for her son‚Äù

That line always hit hard. Even in normal humans, that situation would be tough. In Steven/Rose‚Äôs case, I can‚Äôt even imagine."
Unrequited Love,I'm sad this era of animation is over thanks to HBO.
Unrequited Love,I would like to point out that later episodes show that Pearl was literally Roses slave. So it‚Äôs a slave having feelings for her master and she‚Äôs so devoted to rose even after death and can‚Äôt get over it cause rose asked her to never stop feeling for her. I wouldn‚Äôt call any of this a good thing. I‚Äôm hindsight it makes this song seem really hollow.
Unrequited Love,peak CN was dexters/cow/jhonny/pp girls/courage/eds not this
Unrequited Love,"Steven Universe and it's sequel Steven Universe Future was quite possibly the most emotionally mature show in TV. Cartoon or live action included. It handled some incredibly deep issues so well that kis and their parents can both enjoy. 

The episodes of Steven Universe Future with the ""Steven Tag"" was heartbreaking from a parent's perspective and their kids growing up but was so good."
Unrequited Love,"Wow, a lot wrong here.

First if all, it wasn't an unrequited love, they were together for thousands of years. Rose would love humans from time to time but eventually  she'd move on (or they'd die) and she'd be with Pearl again, as Pearl and Rose were effectively (barring an accident or murder) immortal.

Secondly, part of the uncertainty (""It's over isn't it? Isn't it? isn't it over?"") Comes from the uncertain status. Rose gave up her existence to create Steven, but is that absolutely the end? Might she return again, perhaps after Steven's life, if he proves mortal?

Died in childbirth and Pearl's love for Rose being unrequited, did you just watch like...that one episode?"
Unrequited Love,Pink/Rose really messed Pearl up. Just so much damage and none of it hashed out before Steven was born. Poor soul.
Unrequited Love,This show sucks.
Unrequited Love,"Err... Pearl is a born slave with a toxic, almost pathetically dependent one-way relationship with a childish space Nazi. Steven Universe is a dark, inappropriate for children mess. The song is fine (some of them are good tbf), but Sugar's show is not okay in many ways. When Season 2 ended, it took an immediate nosedive. The series finale was the rotten cherry on top with the one-episode redemption arc of a genocidal villain.

Also... if fusion is meant to represent an... *intimate* bond between two or more Gems, what is going on between Steven and Connie (two underage kids) and Steven and Greg (father and son) when they fuse? ‚ò†üíÄ

EDIT: People downvoting en masse, but no one really seems to argue against my points mentioned here. Weird. :^)"
Unrequited Love,I can't bring myself to watch Steven Universe after Steven implies that the Diamonds are family to him
Unrequited Love,[deleted]
Unrequited Love,CN stopped having any peaks about 2008
Unrequited Love,[removed]
Unrequited Love,"A pretty good quartet sang a pretty good arrangement of this at our international contest [this past summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiChRPulzdc). 

I still haven't seen Steven Universe, so at the time I had no idea what it was from, or that it was even from anything, but the lyrics are so heartbreaking even without context."
Unrequited Love,"Honestly the last moment I remember being impressed and moved by Steven Universe. I dropped it soon after this episode, it was just really starting to make me sad. It's plot had run it's course, the 10 minute long episode runtimes were killing it, and I just didn't think it was as good anymore. But there were some really amazing episodes, mostly focused on Pearl, Rose and Greg, that I'll always hold close to my heart."
Unrequited Love,This episode fucked me up for a while- because it made me realize i was hanging onto a past relationship. Im happy to say i was able to move on and find new relationships. But i still think about that person everyday like the one that got away.
Unrequited Love,"I swear I have some kind of misophonia variant. Musicals and such irrationally irritate me. I like music (particularly early 90s grunge), but when a song becomes part of the plot of something, I can't bear it."
Unrequited Love,"Didn't like how From Here to Homeworld played out so fast, but the ending of the SU movie and Future left a satisfied taste in my mouth.

Wait, hang on...bit of phrasing there."
Unrequited Love,"I remember my father, brother and I were having a conversation while I was trying to watch this episode. We all got quiet when this part came on. I was on the verge of tears, and then the conversation picked up like normal. The power of art."
Unrequited Love,"Well, I think Pearl IS a codependent mess.  After all, she's a pearl, ""bred"" to be obedient to her diamond. Love came into play for Pearl, which just made kind of a mess of her head.  Part love, part obedient servant."
Unrequited Love,"I have no context for anything you‚Äôve just said, but your description of its effect upon you has left me wanting to give this series a try."
Unrequited Love,"Future was fucking stupid in how in sets up a bunch of new plotlines that dont get resolved. 

Volleyball was a super important Pearl development and then she disappears. 

Bluebird was a random ass new threat that just disappears after vowing to kill Steven. 

PERIDOT AND LAPIS DON‚ÄôT HAVE ANY DIALOGUE TOGETHER. Don‚Äôt know what the fuck Sugar was thinking"
Unrequited Love,Help an ignorant and dumb man understand. What is this dynamic she‚Äôs singing about because I am way off with my guessing.
Unrequited Love,"The big ""reveal"" with Steven at the end of the show in front of the diamonds legit makes me tear up every time I see it

The show gets a lot of flak, but it's really really solid"
Unrequited Love,They also had to redraw the animation for Pearl because the voice actress put so much emotion into it. Epic acting move.
Unrequited Love,"Steven Universe is a show just full of those.  One of my favorites, and that's coming from someone who was already grey of hair when he saw the first episode.

I do have to admit it took a while to grow on me, and for a long time it was just background noise I'd occasionally overhear around the younger folks. But then I caught little glimpses of the end of season 1 and got hooked."
Unrequited Love,">Def one of the most adult moments I can recall in a family cartoon.

Then we get to ""Steven Universe: Future.""

That whole series fucked me up, man."
Unrequited Love,"Oof, coming to realize later that Helga's mom was an alcoholic, her dad was a workaholic, and the favored child Olga was always on the bring of breaking because she felt so much pressure on her.

Helga woulda been the most relatable if she didn't have the creepy Arnold statue made of gum in the closet thing."
Unrequited Love,Regular Show also did a good job with this. Mordecai spent the entire 8 seasons chasing Margaret before realizing it was just a silly crush and that they are better as friends than lovers and that he needed to move on.
Unrequited Love,They did do that in a later episode when Steven was a baby and she tried taking his gem out. Shit got dark.
Unrequited Love,"Season 1 is a bit wonky, a little too childish, but it gets going by season 2. Season 1 is instrumental for certain things to be meaningful later (most notably the Steven/Connie relationship, fusion and what the monsters they fight actually *are*, Greg's lack of wealth until this very episode, etc.). But you could start with a hand-selected list of episodes, a bigger fan will probably tell you it's *all* important but you can skip around season 1 and watch maybe 10 of its 52 episodes. Just watch in order by the time you get to season 1 finale."
Unrequited Love,"The emotional intelligence of this ""kids show"" is staggering. Made me cry more than once."
Unrequited Love,"I've heard one other song from this show and it was pretty damn good but I still can't separate the knowledge I have of the fandom from the show itself. Every time I think about watching the show I just get echoes of ""you're whitewashing this character that we decided is POC-coded because she's purrrrrrppppplllllleeeee"""
Unrequited Love,*Discovery
Unrequited Love,"You're correct. I loved SU at its peak but they really dropped the ball with the ending. You can't make the villains fascist mass-murderers and just redeem them at the end ""bEcAuse thEy'Re fAmiLy"". It's why I don't recommend the series to friends."
Unrequited Love,"Regular Show, Adventure Time, Over the Garden Wall, etc. all received near-universal acclaim throughout their runs. It petered out a bit for me by the time OK KO came out (I really hate its animation style) but I watched these as a teenager and in college, give them a shot. CN Real was a dumb experiment and Adventure Time in particular revived the network in the public consciousness. I remember seeing the t-shirts throughout high school and not just by the nerdy kids.

HBO Max's desire to kill its staggering animation history makes it all the sadder that the last real CN show for kids *and* adults, Infinity Train, is only available on iTunes now and a persona non grata to David Zaslav due to residuals to animators."
Unrequited Love,"Lol but it's fitting for SU....loads of double entendre in it.

But it's precisely the movie and Future I don't like....but then anything doubling down on the anti Rose agenda and leaving the Diamonds unshattered/unpunished would've left me fuming. Oh well, I am glad the other half of the fanbase enjoys."
Unrequited Love,"Your people gave SU at least a few moments of their time?!

I can't get anyone in my circle to, but still I aspire to it one day. That sounds like a perfect moment."
Unrequited Love,"Yeah I feel like people forget that the gems have some pretty stringent programming in the back of their minds that is shown to still be extremely present throughout characters we know.

‚ÄúDo it for her‚Äù is still a massive demonstration of this she conveys all her feelings about obligation to rose and her willingness to disregard her own safety and to die to protect her and try‚Äôs to transfer all of that baggage onto Connie who she sees as the equivalent for Steven. 

And those things are conveyed much earlier than it‚Äôs over isn‚Äôt it.

Most of pearls arc throughout the show is learning to be her own person with her own needs, wants and desires instead of the ‚Äòservant‚Äô for rose(as was her original programming) and a ton of that requires her breaking out from that dependence on rose"
Unrequited Love,"My issue I suppose is the show reinforcing anything done on Rose's part to make her feel that way, which makes it seem worse, more noticeable, and invalidating of the love she feels. Now We're Only Falling Apart should've been the final word on Rose's feelings on it, where she's depicted as being extremely uncomfortable with it and tries to shut it down at every turn. 

Yes any leaning into those feelings is suggestive of her ""purpose"" and how much she needs to move away from it, but I like the greater mix earlier parts of the show had where the love feels genuine and something you can root for, but not the subservience. Taking into account the show as a whole it's made it seem *all* subservience and I just think this song is less tragic that way, more ""pathetic,"" and I don't like it.

Do It For Her has been mentioned but it's brilliant because it can be read multiple ways. People who didn't literally serve a loved one in real life would still die for them if they needed to and we don't call that unhealthy, and by that point in the show you feel Rose would too if Pearl would allow it, and speaking for her is the problem rather than her dedication to her. This plays out with Steven aka Rose herself in a sense where he doesn't want to stop Connie from having his back, but wants to fight alongside her. 

This part of the show depicts Pearl's relationship with Rose as complicated, but coming from a place of real love and clarity. Those ""silly games"" with Greg mentioned shows real capacity for self-reflection so she knows deep down she has issues, but maybe casting the sum total of her feelings as the issue weakens the power of It's Over Isn't It. Just my two cents."
Unrequited Love,"If you do end up enjoying it, remember to shoot me a message if you want, I'd really like to hear about it. :)"
Unrequited Love,"Its a very long story.  Trying to keep it as short as I can, she was the right-hand to Rose Quartz and she developed feelings for her.  However, Rose Quartz eventually developed feelings for a human (Greg, Steven's father) and, in order for them to have a kid, Rose had to give up her 'gem' to her child, which means her death. Pearl (and the other crystal gems) also had to raise Steven afterwards as they had no idea what a Human/Gem hybrid could end up like.

Rose and Pearl were together a long time.  So the song is about her still trying to move on from Rose's passing, as well as her jealousy towards Greg."
Unrequited Love,"She dedicated and changed her entire life for a woman she loved only to have her fall for someone else. But because she loved her so much, she dedicated herself to her love‚Äôs son after she died. Steven is a constant reminder that Rose is gone forever and a testament to what Pearl lost when Rose died."
Unrequited Love,"I love Steven Universe: Future so much. It's so rare we ever get to see cartoon characters age (anything more than a one-off scene in the future is almost non existent), and it really allowed us to explore Steven's life from a new perspective. I feel like the main show was very heavily focused on the story of a child learning about the failings of his seemingly-perfect mother and having to right her wrongs, while Future really started letting Steven become his own person. The updates in character designs and behaviors were just the cherry on top"
Unrequited Love,"Oh yeah, and what would you make the statue out of huh? Ramen?"
Unrequited Love,Broken people becoming obsessed with someone they view as successful and can solve all of their problems is incredibly relatable.
Unrequited Love,"I can't comment about any race related aspect of the show, but I rarely hear good things about the fandom.

They even bullied a fellow fan-artist into attempting suicide."
Unrequited Love,This era ended even before AT&T even involved.
Unrequited Love,I mean you gotta admit that is all very much in brand for who stevens character is.
Unrequited Love,The end shows that the diamonds are all working hard to be better. They're not just magically forgiven now.
Unrequited Love,"I mean, it‚Äôs also pretty easy to recommend the show up through the wedding with the caveat that everything after doesn‚Äôt handle the antagonists well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Unrequited Love,While it may not have been as satisfying for you you have to admit that Steven forgiving and rehabilitating the diamonds is 100% on brand for him.
Unrequited Love,"The show had just reached its half-way point when it was cancelled following the wedding episode, everything else was concessions Sugar was able to get from Cartoon Network to wrap up loose ends.  They had no choice but to wrap it up fast :(

As for the anti Rose agenda, something they never got the chance to explore was how Steven had been learning about his mom's life in reverse, from how she was right before he was born to the spoiled monster she was when she was very young.  She had a fantastic character arc, just told in reverse.  I think there would have been an episode about realizing and grappling with this.  His mom was a wonderful person deep down, she just had to break from her toxic childhood household to become that.

Im super happy to see that the show has touched so many people, even when they didnt super enjoy the post-cancel stuff"
Unrequited Love,"Yeah, I think when you include the movie and Future the show ends up having pretty great pacing.  Starts slow, builds in bursts of  expanded lore mixed with periods of downtime, suddenly you are going through a resolution you didn't expect, but then there's time to grow into it and move on."
Unrequited Love,"I just found it this year, is there any other shows you‚Äôd recommend?"
Unrequited Love,"I can't get over that the show's premise hinges on the fact that essentially a woman committed suicide in order to have a baby so the love of her life could be a single father, rather than just not doing that so they could live together as a couple. 

Like... does it make more sense in the show?"
Unrequited Love,"I'm not sure about ""developed feelings for her"" is right. Because one of the problems of the show is that Pearl was specifically designed to obey her superior. In this case, Pearl was always supposed to be kinda obssesed with RQ/PD. By default, she was always gonna be by Rose's side no matter what. I think this is why some fans were upset by the big reveal."
Unrequited Love,"So she‚Äôs Snape 2.0?

I feel like I‚Äôm right but Steven Universe Stan‚Äôs can‚Äôt take the comparison, oh noooo it wasn‚Äôt a totally original idea"
Unrequited Love,Oh shit I had it right. That is a pretty complicated character for 2010 cartoon.
Unrequited Love,Snape vibes.
Unrequited Love,"I think the ending was fitting, but the way it was done in the ""shippuden"" was not great, also the villain of the movie was kinda reviving a plot that was already finished, which seemed like a ""do it for money"" type of movie."
Unrequited Love,"I'm not sure if there would've been that episode or not, but I did notice the reason Steven and so many fans who eat up anything vilifying Rose is because her story was told backwards. But Greg nailed it when he said at some point, I forget when exactly in the story, that who she was then doesn't matter, it's who she was when they met that counted. I feel like more characters, including Steven and including Sapphire when she and Ruby split apart, should've taken that to heart more quickly.

But I'm not judging by the show by what they should've done or perhaps would've done, it's just I hate where they leave us with Rose. Big swatches of the early emotional thrusts in the series mean less when that person is depicted as being as bad as they would later treat her. Your last bit is spot on though, for my gripes and for how imperfect I feel the show is as a whole, it does mean a lot to me."
Unrequited Love,"She-Ra definitely (Reboot), and Infinity Train. :)"
Unrequited Love,"I second Reboot She-Ra.

Also the Owl House and Gravity Falls.  All 3 of these has some similar emotionally heavy themes as Steven Universe,  especially Owl House. These are shoes that both adults and kids love and get different things out of. 

Also another surprisingly emotionally mature cartoon is Helluva Boss and Hazbin Hotel on YouTube. The are adults only due to themes and language but are surprisingly emotionally mature in ways that adult shows like Family Guy are not."
Unrequited Love,"BoJack Horseman.  Adventure Time. 

And Yes! Love for Infinity Train!!"
Unrequited Love,"It does with...later revelations.

>!Rose Quartz wasn't actually who she said she was. She was actually Pink Diamond and was tasked with colonizing the earth for Gem kind...by wiping out all organic life. She refused and created an alter ego (Rose) to lead a rebellion (the Crystal Gems) against...well, against herself. She was playing both sides. Eventually she faked her death by making it look like Rose killed Pink. She figured the other Diamonds wouldn't care, and she could now live in peace on earth as Rose Quartz!<

>!Bad news. The other Diamonds *did* care. They launched an attack on earth that drove 99% of the Crystal Gems mad, turning them into mindless monsters. Only Rose and a couple others survived. For thousands of years they've been fighting these monsters, their own fallen comrades, to protect earth. And ""Rose"" knows that she's responsible for all of it. Giving up her life to create someone new, someone who can live free on earth as she wanted to, but without the centuries of guilt and trauma, is her way of finally achieving peace!<

Yeah, it's pretty heavy stuff for a kids show."
Unrequited Love,"Rose's feelings for Greg are questionable. She doesn't ever really understand human love.  Her love for Greg at least on screen is more of a fascination, like an alien studying what humans are like. She is an alien after all. 

She falls in love with Earth and the human race's ability to grow and change, since gems are born for a single purpose and are not meant to change. A human being growing and changing is the greatest thing she had ever seen, and that's what she wanted to experience and give to Greg and Steven."
Unrequited Love,Yea I mean. I think rose knew that her cause was best represented and achieved by a half human half gem who is raised surrounded by love. She believed he could do what she couldn‚Äôt.
Unrequited Love,"Just saying, some women go through delicate pregnancies, so this situation is very real, idk why you would think it's nonsensical."
Unrequited Love,Except Pearl tale care of steven after the death of Rose
Unrequited Love,"She was also created to be a slave and given to Rose (a member of the monarchy) who started encouraging her to have her own thoughts and feelings and talking to her like a friend... but still very much treated Pearl like her sidekick and assumed Pearl would do what she said. Most prominently and horribly when she made Pearl participate in faking Rose's murder, and gave a magically compelling order for it to be kept secret which was still in effect thousands of years later, even after Rose's death - like, we eventually see Pearl trying to break the order and tell Steven what happened, and she's repeatedly forced to shut herself up. It's kind of disturbing.

Pearl's love for Rose was all mixed up with the servant role she was created to play, and as much as she missed and grieved Rose, I also don't think their relationship was healthy and equal, or that she really got to be her own independant person until after Rose died."
Unrequited Love,"Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children, and convincing Steven she hates him."
Unrequited Love,"Damn, that's some real heavy shit right there."
Unrequited Love,Holy fuck that‚Äôs indeed a show worthy of the praise it gets then. I always thought it was one of those things the internet gets insanely attached to for no apparent reason but that summary changed my mind.
Unrequited Love,The sucky thing is Steven ended up inheriting all those problems.
Unrequited Love,"I've seen enough anime to know this is not the most traumatic thing shown to kids through animation by a long shot 

But that's an interesting plot"
Unrequited Love,Didn't Snape do the same of Harry after Lily's death?
Unrequited Love,Sweet Jebus.
Unrequited Love,">Except Pearl doesn't go around abusing children

Not intentionally, hard to argue her training of Connie didn't at least border on abuse"
Unrequited Love,"""Dang Steven, when did you get so mature?""

""Right around the time I learned my mom was a war criminal."""
Unrequited Love,To be fair its not a perfect show. Pacing is off and too many deux ex machinas. But the plot and world building is fascinating.
Unrequited Love,"The show really throws out conventional storytelling structure for a kids fantasy show (the central mystery of the show revolves around a deceased character who we only ever learn about from the incomplete pov of other characters revealed and foreshadowed across five seasons, and that‚Äôs just one story thread) and I think it mostly but not entirely succeeds."
Unrequited Love,One thing I really appreciate is they don't shy away from how awful Rose often was. But it's not like you find out she was secretly a villain or something. She's just a very complex sometimes very selfish person.
Unrequited Love,Generational trauma is a bitch.
Unrequited Love,"Taking care as in building a house,living with and raising Steven."
Unrequited Love,"No, she actually becomes one of his primary caretakers, the episode this song is from is also all about her bonding over shared grief with Greg, Steven's father who rose ""left"" Pearl for"
Unrequited Love,Isn't this literally dialogue from the show?
Unrequited Love,"It definitely isn't a perfect show, but also to be fair CN didn't exactly make it easy for them to manage their pacing"
Unrequited Love,"Rose isn‚Äôt awful, she was a messed up child who rebelled and ran away from her family as a teenager and grew up to be a loving but flawed and regretful adult. She just lived in a society with no concept of childhood or growing up. Actually, now that I think about it, Greg had a pretty similar relationship with his parents (overbearing, ran away, estranged), just without the cosmic consequences, but it makes it more obvious why they made sense together."
Unrequited Love,"Yes, hence the quotes."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Another type of role Ford rarely does is playing the villain. What Lies Beneath was the first movie that I saw where he was the bad guy and one of the few instances in which  I saw him die in a movie
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Some of his line delivery‚Äôs in the Star Wars movies are some of the funniest stuff in SW. Also the look he gives the sword guy in Raiders of the Lost Ark before shooting him is hilarious. He knows how to do funny.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",It isn‚Äôt Hollywood that chose not to put Harrison Ford in comedies. That was his choice.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","The scene at the start of the ep, where he is just staring at Jason Segal (Jimmy), but insists he is talking to Sean. So goooood."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",There's a old movie starring him that you'd love... The Frisco Kid. A western buddy comedy with Gene Wilder (playing a Polish rabbi trying to cross america alive with the help of Ford's character - a bank robbery).
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Harrison Ford is known to be very selective of the scripts he accepts, so maybe it's his fault not Hollywood's

I have also seen him in quite a few comedies, mostly romantic comedies, am not sure if those are considered comedy roles or not"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Even though this past weeks episode handled some heavy shit for a lot of the character‚Äôs (Ford‚Äôs included) he was the highlight of the episode and every line of his dialogue was amazing.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Did he want to be in more comedies?
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He was low-key hilarious in Morning Glory, if you want another example."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Watch his appearances on Conan
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I really like Hollywood Homicide for this reason. It‚Äôs arguably a stupid movie but seeing him being silly is just kind of great.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I mean like at least 50% of his best scenes as Han Solo and Indy are comedic scenes. Probably more than 50%.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I've seem him in some interviews and he's funny AF. Now that he's older and can't do quite as much action, I'd love to see him in some comedy movies!"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",He was fantastic in this episode! We were cracking up.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Hollywood didn‚Äôt fuck up. Ford picks what he wants to do.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Its very unfortunate that ""comedians"" on average don't get paid as much as serious actors. 

&#x200B;

Often times my favorite guest starring roles are when serious, drama actors show up on comedies for a small role. See: Matt Damon, Selma Hayek, and Peter Dinklage on 30 Rock, Jon Hamm on 30 Rock and Kimmy Schmidt."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",If he isn't at least nominated for Best Supporting Actor Emmy I will be pissed
"Kiss Him, Not Me","The roles he is most famous for have him being funny, han solo and Indiana Jones."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He needs to go full Leslie Nielsen and become a deadpan comedy movie star. Leslie was a ""normal"" actor his entire career until Airplane in 1980"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",About time for a Grumpy Old Men reboot
"Kiss Him, Not Me",[Harrison Ford being unimpressed with his career for 20 minutes](https://youtu.be/XNN1Hbg9oNU)
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He's a perfect ""straight man"" in Star Wars (mostly just the first one), and especially as Indiana Jones. So much of what makes Last Crusade work is Harrison Ford's natural sense of comedic timing as a straight man."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",[deleted]
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Shrinking is just lovely.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",This show is surprisingly so great! I really haven‚Äôt enjoyed a new TV show in so long
"Kiss Him, Not Me","This is pretty much his real life persona. I'm sure they just filmed Harrison Ford being Harrison Ford and edited it into the show.

Edit: typo"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I was just watching 1923, and in the first episode He's walking into a bar and one of the women protesting for Prohibition stops him at the door. He points out the sign also says ""Soda"". The woman counters that the prostitutes work out of a building called a Dance Hall, and the mock look of surprise on his face and his ""You don't say!"" just killed me.

He's always been dead pan funny, but that was always mixed in dramas."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Check out Harrison Ford 6 days 7 nights movie
"Kiss Him, Not Me",The best part about him on the show is I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the closest thing to a ‚Äúnormal dude‚Äù he‚Äôs ever played. He‚Äôs great. The scene of him jamming to sugar ray in the car was great
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Really such a great show all around, but yes, he is hilarious in it"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Agreed. As much as I‚Äôm enjoying the show in general, the takeaway I‚Äôve been telling people about the show is that I‚Äôm upset I haven‚Äôt been watching Harrison Ford in more comedy over the last forty years. Granted it‚Äôs also this comedic skill that has made his action characters so likeable."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I haven't seen the latest episode yet but I do love this show and I especially love his performance!
"Kiss Him, Not Me",OP is 13 and has only seen Star Wars apparently.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","This show is so excellent. At times I get some Scrubs essence from the writing/editing, and it makes me so happy Bill Lawrence is still making quality TV. 

Plus the addition of Segal and Goldstein? I hope the three of them make a hundred different TV shows together.

I think if Donald or Zach cameo on the show my head will explode."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He was great in the rom-com Six Days, Seven Nights."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Never forget, while the Hollywood elite was criticized for giving the pedophile fugitive Roman Polanski a standing ovation, it was Harrison Ford who made the special trip to Paris to hand deliver the award to his best buddy."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I had exactly the same thought watching it.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",[deleted]
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I really enjoy the show. All the characters are endearing.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Amazing how difficult it is to pull off deadpan when you're baked all the time.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","You should watch more movies he is in, most of his acting roles have some comedy in them."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I know ‚Ä¶
"Kiss Him, Not Me",You didn't think Witness was hilarious?
"Kiss Him, Not Me",More comedies? He was already in Anchorman 2 how much more do you need
"Kiss Him, Not Me",üëçüòÜ
"Kiss Him, Not Me",He's hilarious in Shrinking lol.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",He's so good in Shrinking.  I'm really enjoying the show so far.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","We don't need another DeNiro which career is f**ked up by the amount of bad comedy flicks. Ford do some good or mediocre, like Morning Glory which is really fun movie."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Obviously not as good as the first one, but I loved his small part in anchorman 2"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Yes! I just found this show last week, and it's impeccable.  The whole cast just gels and seems perfectly suited and the comedy is outstanding.  I haven't laughed out loud at a tv show in years!  I love this show so much!"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","he seems so high profile to me that i did not think he would be in this show so much, every one on this show is so good i did not expect such a good watch! every line he does cracks me up"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Like Tom Cruise as Vincent in Collateral. He should play more villain roles.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Spoiler Alert! (Lol, j/k). 

I adore Harrison Ford, and have done since I saw Return of the Jedi when I was 9. I‚Äôm loving seeing him in Shrinking, his sardonic humor is on full display in that role. One of my favorite roles was his very subtly played villain in What Lies Beneath, which I think is a very underrated thriller."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I think that helped the movie since I just didn‚Äôt see the twist coming _because_ it was Ford.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Well he's about to be a major villain in the MCU. Wonder if that's part of why he took the role. Ross is a real asshole.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Iirc (and I haven't seen it in decades) is he was pretty creepy too.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Very good in The Conversation as well. Slick and dangerous
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Only other villain I can think of is evil Indy in Temple of Doom
"Kiss Him, Not Me","What Lies Beneath is a great movie, and I will never understand why the trailer completely spoils the twist."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","> Some of his line delivery‚Äôs in the Star Wars movies are some of the funniest stuff in SW.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjEpLoL0ls"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",">Also the look he gives the sword guy in Raiders of the Lost Ark before shooting him

He was sick as hell with food poisoning and was supposed to do a fight scene with him.  They improvised the shooting because he felt so bad.  That look was probably real."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Also see his skits with chewbacca on Jimmy Kimmel. 

‚ÄúShe was my wife!!!‚Äù"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",You must have hit it pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that!
"Kiss Him, Not Me","The Fugitive too! That one armed man joke kills

/s"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Shit I think the look on his face after all the guys pull guns on him in the trailer for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is hilarious too.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He‚Äôs in an obscene amount of comedies anyway, so the OP makes no sense."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","""Oh gosh, so needy"""
"Kiss Him, Not Me",His chemistry with Jason Segel is amazing on this show. I've always really liked Jason Segel but never thought of him as a particularly great actor but this show definitely gives him the right material to really showcase his talents.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","That's one of the best. When they're trying to stay warm in the barn. ""C'mere, darling."" LOL Or discussing the last prairie chicken at dinner. ""You think you got a chance?"" ""I think I can say with complete confidence, none whatsoever."" And then Ford just grins and gives him the last of the food. Or running from the law waitonvfor sunset ""Now?"" That movie is just excellent."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I‚Äôve loved this movie since I‚Äôve been a kid, I still quote it.  ‚ÄúWell I come from the Texas‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to BE AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE!‚Äù  It‚Äôs a great movie that holds up even now"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I love Brett Goldsteins story about getting Harrison Ford for Shrinking.

[Link for the curious](https://youtu.be/WfV-Sph5K6o#t=6m25s)"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",And anchorman 2
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Yes those rom coms. They have a totally different vibe. No room for dry one line zingers or Ford just being grumpy and direct.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",The ‚Äúoh my god I can‚Äôt drive‚Äù bit from a few episodes was great
"Kiss Him, Not Me",This was the episode that will have me be really surprised if he doesn't get an Emmy nomination next year.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Yes, I loved the scene where he brought a case of beer and asked two questions and suddenly the marine can finally talk about his past.

The show is very thin on drama or any ""heavy shit""."
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I think he wanted to get paid and laid, and then be left the fuck alone. So if they could provide those things, I'm sure he'd have been willing."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Came here to mention this. Great curmudgeon!
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Frrrittatta.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","yesssss, underrated movie"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He doesn't like smurfs.

https://conanclassic.com/video/harrison-ford-hates-smurfs"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","He doesn't like smurfs.

https://conanclassic.com/video/harrison-ford-hates-smurfs"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",I really love this movie. I kind of feel like it rhymes with Atlanta.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",God I haven't thought about that movie in yonks. Adding it to my list.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","*It's Salma Hayek. 

I've just seen so many people call her Selma recently."
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Jon Hamm does a *ton* of comedic roles along with dramedies. It's to the point that it often seems like he prefers it to dramatic roles.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Matt Damon‚Äôs best small role in a comedy is in Eurotrip.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Ooooo tell me who else should be in it, I'd watch this"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","> He held his own on Whats Up Doc

I f'love that movie and he did, indeed

*(Also, Madelaine Kahn absolutely stole every scene she was in)*

I need to rewatch that this weekend LOL"
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I wasn't sure when I heard they were making a comedy about grief,  but it's been really good so far. And co-created and written by Roy from Ted Lasso!"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",[Man Always Gets Little Rush out of Telling People John Lennon Beat Wife](https://www.theonion.com/man-always-gets-little-rush-out-of-telling-people-john-1819578998)
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Psychologists are generally pretty self aware and since the show is about psychologists and their friends/family it kinda makes sense.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","yesss, he needs more villain roles


also, it still holds up"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Les Grossman is another great role for Cruise.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","I genuinely believe that Tom Cruise could've done a better job in Django Unchained, than Dicaprio did. I can't really remember Cruise ever having done a convincing accent, but outside of that, he would've been fantastic"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Mosquito Coast
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Still a great movie to this day.
"Kiss Him, Not Me","Yes! I have adored this man since I was a child too, and he can do no wrong!! My husband likes to counter that he is a terrible pilot, but I just give him the death stare and he shuts up!üòÜ"
"Kiss Him, Not Me",aka what OP just said.
"Kiss Him, Not Me",Ford and most of the crew had dysentery

Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"The BMW people talk about how they still get residuals today. They were just joking about getting another 9¬¢ check.

They actually just had an episode where they talked about it.  They got different amounts depending on where it aired."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"All I know is Jaleel White came up with a brand of weed called ""Did I Do That"" and got rich again."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Absolutely, and even worse."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"I don't have any specific knowledge to contribute, but there's a bit of a chicken and egg thing here.  Those shows pay non-stop because they're inexpensive to run. If the contracts were better negotiated, something else would be playing in their place."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Aren‚Äôt these agreements governed by union contracts?  And don‚Äôt they have professional agents negotiating on their behalf?
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Jodi Sweetin was on Steve-O‚Äôs podcast and briefly talked about her Full House residuals; it‚Äôs enough to pay a bill a month, but nothing else. She also talked about how Netflix pays out on their shows as well. The whole interview is really worth checking out."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"It's Hollywood accounting.  According to CBS, ""Star Trek"" has yet to make a profit."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"If you get more on the back end, you get less on the front end."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"As actors, I think they caught a huge break. If they got screwed, they should talk to their legal guardians. There are industry groups and unions that do nothing but make sure that their members get a fair deal. If they didn't use those, their guardians should be sued."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,It‚Äôs the Nickelodeon and Disney kids that don‚Äôt get residuals.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Lol isn‚Äôt it called purple urkel?
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"There is much truth to that. That is why I Love Lucy and Andy Griffith and many black and white sitcoms were a staple of tv reruns in the 70, 80's and 90's ,and many sitcoms post 1970 quickly faded after 1st run syndication. The agreement of the 1970 SAG strike excluded pre 1970 shows from residual pay for performers. Ironically we are seeing something similiar play out in real time,where streaming Networks to save money will start cutting recent shows  but back catalog shows will be fine because per the terms of contracts of most contracts signed 15-20 years ago they don't have to give them any residuals for streaming even if a show is popular because streaming did not exist."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"They're supposed to be, but if the show is owned by (for example) Disney, and they sell it to ABC affiliates for $1.  What percentage of that goes to the actors?  Zilch."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,It‚Äôs weird I never really thought about it but I feel like millennials and older have knowledge of these old shows that the younger people haven‚Äôt been exposed to.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"You'd be surprised perhaps, the younger kids are doing this thing where they get really into older media or time periods and make me feel OLD for not being into the stuff my parents were. Things kinda just work their way back in cycles, like clothing trends or hairstyles."

Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"There are 5 terrestrial channels in the UK; BBC1 and 2, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Ah, a fellow of culture. Kris Straub (creator of the Candle Cove creepypasta) made a webcomic, Broodhollow(unfortunately I think he stopped after book 2), and the YouTube series Local 58, which very much keeps the Candle Cove spirit alive and well . Recommended if you haven't seen them!"

Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,yt reccomentdations and i didnt know what it was
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"As an American, my experience with Channel 4 is that it tends to have more absurd or experimental comedies than the BBC does."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,[Local 58](https://youtube.com/c/LOCAL58TV) has some genuinely unsettling content. The first time I saw Contingency was half asleep in the middle of the night. It left me feeling a certain way. Its a shame he hasn't made anything in awhile.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Yeah I'm fucking old.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Hmm, you ok?"
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"It's definitely true, for better or worse. BBC is funded by the TV license so tends to be a bit tamer than the independent channels."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"if /u/somemorestalecontent was 8 when DHMIS came out then he's 20 years old now. I'm 20 too, right? No, wait, I'm 21. I must be 21 because I'm old enough to drink and I do it a lot...But no older.

Surely I'm not already 32, still spending my idle hours on this same social media site, reading about the same viral video content I watched over a decade ago. Were I that old I'd have much money in the bank and an ascendant career, a wife, a family, a house. Not living essentially the same indolent life I lived all those years ago.

Surely that can't be true. I, too, was 8 when it came out. There's no other explanation."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,The Pontifex Maximus got nothing on this television show. They're gonna show Caesar how it's done!

Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,The comment about it being broadcast on Tubi the next day makes me wonder if Hulu will no longer have new Fox episodes the day after they premiere.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Just gonna predict a season 4 meltdown of some kind right now.

Anyone know how the production of other shows affects Rick and Marty? Solar Opposites didn't seem to take any energy away from season 4, I wonder if Harmon will have to give up time on R&M for this."

Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,You had me at Dan Harmon. Solely because of community. The fact that he also does Rick and Morty is just a bonus feature of Harmon. From Community alone he has earned my eternal viewership.

Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,So is it basically disney owns all the old fox shows but wont own any of the new ones? I think?
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,[What doesn't Fox greenlight?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oMTmtN7lHI)
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Boy, has it become edgy to shit on R & M. LoL"
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"I think this should be shopped to FX, Adult Swim or a streaming platform. I can‚Äôt picture this on FOX after the Simpsons and before Family Guy because after a while the network executives will hate this show and demand Harmon make changes before not scheduling episodes or burying it in the 7:30/6:30 pm Sunday night time slot before canceling it, just like Futurama."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Given how enjoyable Harmonquest was, I have high hopes."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,The future for Fox animation is somewhat bright but at the same time it‚Äôs not cause Duncanville and Bless the Harts are unlikely to get s3. Makes me kinda sad.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,alright
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Have them play through ‚ÄúHades‚Äù
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Sounds cool. Can't wait for fans to ruin it.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Season one will be in 2025.  Season two will be in 2077.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,So once again fuck Rick and Morty or what?
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"How surprising to see the top comments being cynical snarky vaguely angry stuff.

That's not what one would expect."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,This will only encourage the gen z kids who think Hades is an UwU Daddy Deity
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Sweet, anything by Dan Harmon I‚Äôm down for"
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"At the pace these two work, I look forward to the first season in 2027"
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,What happened to ten seasons of rick and morty lol
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Like he needs another show to not finish on time
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"I can‚Äôt wait to watch one season of this, wait three years for the second season, and then see it get canceled."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Finish Rick and morty first you dick!
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Dan Harmon needs to start taking his ADHD meds and focus on one series at a time; he ends up screwing over some truly great media by jumping ship creatively.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"I‚Äôm kinda tired with Dan Harmons writing style after watching R+M and Community. Let‚Äôs hope the main character isn‚Äôt another super-snarky, charming, narcissist, with ‚Äòcommitment issues‚Äô."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Animation's biggest narcissist sells a show in which Narcissus will likely be a character. That's some real Harmon-esque meta-humor.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Yo sysiphus can you push this boulder up to the top of this hill for me? Quick 20 minute adventure
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"On the one hand im excited, on the other hand if its a nihilistic series like rick and mory i‚Äôd be sad. (Rick and morty is objectively a very good show, i just cant stand its harshness)."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Really wish Hollywood would stop letting dudes like Dan Harmon and Joss Whedon make shows :/ can‚Äôt wait for Dan Harmon to stick a sexy woman in the show with complex emotions and call himself a feminist or some bs like that
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"I'll probably check it out, but honestly I don't really think Dan Harmon is that great."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Sidebet on ""it's time to kick some serious Athens"" joke"
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Or, you know, he could work on the shit he already has."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"D√ÜDALUS!!! 

r/Harmontown deep cut cause this is gonna be awesome.

Edit: To find the Greeky ""ae"" thing."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,There better be a lot of gay shit.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,God there are some snarky pendantic fucks commenting in this thread
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Im Pickle-Styx!
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"If it's anything like Rick and Morty, I'll pass."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,What a fantastic time for animation!
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,So another Blood of Zeus?
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Dan Harmon is the new Seth McFarlane?
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Wonder if it will put out eps faster than Rick and Morty. Dan Harmon's is the kirkman of cartoons. Comic fans will get what I mean...
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"I‚Äôve grown up in the PJ generation that loves greek mythology, but you gotta admit that it shows up a lot in pop culture compared to other mythological systems. We should let the others shine."
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Great news. Maybe we can see it in 4 years
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Dan Harmon gets your hopes up then bails everytime. Just like my dad.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Please don‚Äôt be ugly. Pleaaasse don‚Äôt be ugly. Please. Pleasse.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,... and it‚Äôs canceled.
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Sounds entertaining
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,#SixSeasonsAndAMovie!
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,Sounds like an even shittier Disenchantment tbh
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,I see dan harmon i excite
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,"Excited about Harmon show very very much!

Not very excited about Ancient Greece - tired of Disney's Hercules or God of War-like retellings, want to see more straight adaptation done well. But ok"
Arifureta: From Commonplace to Worlds Strongest,So we get another half finished project he dumps after 4 seasons? I love his work but the drama behind the scenes ruins a lot of his projects

True Tunes,If I were to trust Reddit then almost everything is terrible.
True Tunes,"I just really don‚Äôt understand what people were expecting from a ‚ÄúWillow‚Äù TV show. It‚Äôs literally been exactly what I expected. Just like the movie it‚Äôs not that great, but it is a bit of campy fun."
True Tunes,"I've never actually watched videos from this guy but see them pop up every once in a while.

The headlines are always similar to this video.

Does he ever like anything? Or is his entire persona based on taking a big shit on everything?"
True Tunes,It's....fun? Did it have to be something else?
True Tunes,"I‚Äôm enjoying it well enough. Only issue I have is that the last two episodes have been extremely visually dark, and difficult for me to see. Other than that, it‚Äôs fun."
True Tunes,We watched the first 2 episodes and they were entertaining.  But they did not make us eager to watch more and we haven't bothered watching any more.
True Tunes,The issue with this show is that the teenagers who star in it would struggle with getting star roles in high school plays.
True Tunes,"Sadly, I couldn't even make it through the first episode.

:("
True Tunes,I‚Äôm having a hard time finding redeeming qualities in Kit. She‚Äôs so obnoxious. Otherwise it‚Äôs OK.
True Tunes,Couldnt even finish the first episode
True Tunes,"I remember ginger plank of wood from Solo. They did a really long drawn out shot of her face when she removed her helmet like we were all supposed to recognize her and go ""Oh shit! That's...!"""
True Tunes,"Since this guy sums up what I feel so well, I‚Äôll just post a link to his review:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2022/12/22/willow-is-an-abomination/?sh=541791746bb8

I‚Äôm more sad about it than angry‚Ä¶but this doesn‚Äôt feel at all like the Willow universe that I loved so much in my youth.

And it could have been so good‚Ä¶"
True Tunes,"I used to be a fan of the Critical Drinker before his racist dogwhistles became deafening and his gimmick was just enabling him to spout semi-incel rhetoric. I'm having a blast with Willow the series. It's respectful towards the original while being engaging and fun. No, it's not House of the Dragon nor does it need to be to be worthwhile."
True Tunes,"He didn't make it 15 seconds in before he decided his thesis needed ""YEAH FUCKING DIVERSITY HIRES INSTEAD OF REAL CHARACTERS""

Just say the acting or direction was bad, it didn't matter who the fuck was in the roles.  Why always hyperfocus on that?

Then I stopped watching because I just didn't care.

Edit: skipped ahead a little just because I hate myself and I heard him say some form of ""talentless diversity hires"" and ""progressive story"" in a mocking tone twice.  Glad I didn't wait around for this review that was totally not biased and definitely a fair review of a show.

Also, this show probably does suck but not for the reasons this boring, virtue signaling asshole is saying."
True Tunes,Let me guess. Is it because of woke?
True Tunes,"Drinker is going way off the rails recently with savagely eviscerating anything that isn't a perfect fit for his extremely narrow definition of 'good'.  


Out of the last 10 videos I've watched, 1 has been moderately positive. He finds no merit with anything he perceives as *remotely* 'progressive'."
True Tunes,"Episode 4 was the last for me.  Theres fun and campy, and there's this version of willow."
True Tunes,I love the movie it‚Äôs cheesy and silly but such a fantastic story. Haven‚Äôt seen the show yet. To be honest Erin Kellyman is the main reason. She is a horrible horrible actress and just sucks the life of every plot she‚Äôs in. I mean her role in Solo was just boring. Then Captain America and winter soldier. What does this girl do to get these roles man.
True Tunes,Critical Drinker is one of those YouTubers who makes his bones by hating all content. He figured out that hating something stirs the hornets nest of other haters and give him the views he needs to remain somewhat relevant.
True Tunes,I wish I didn‚Äôt agree with this video.
True Tunes,"I really enjoy the show, and especially the humorous bits. Loved the movie too."
True Tunes,"It is bad. Legend of the Seeker does the willow 'feel' better and it is a different IP. That show was phenomenal, and similarish."
True Tunes,Saw a preview for this and thought it was a fucking Geico ad
True Tunes,Have these people seen the original film? They used pretty plain colloquial language even in its source material.
True Tunes,"I think the show was a master piece, it took me some time to get used to the unique style and once I had, I loved it!

Specially the characters, predictable, yet they provided us with the epic heroes we'd expect in any good fantasy show. It had all the key ingredients and they made it so obvious which was so funny!

The finale was a blast, the heroes truly shined in their role. Boorman is definitely my favourite, kit looked stunning in her armor which was actually a suit (wtf amazingly cool)!

All in all, I can't wait for season 2 and I am for sure going to watch the movie now, I didn't know about willow before!!!"
True Tunes,"I grew up watching the movie but im at episode 7 and i do not really like it. The modern dialogue, jokes, music,  trolls that speak and try to be funny it just doesnt fit Lore fantasy. A real downer!"
True Tunes,"Sticking through it for now, not sure where they're really going with it though.

Some of the characters aren't great -

Elora is boring, just the damsel in distress for the most part. Not overly likeable, but that's ok because she doesn't need to be.

Boorman is just the poor man's Mad Martigan. ""I was with him searching for the plot device!"" Need him to die off sometime soon.

Jade, the redhead just needs to get offed as well so Kit can actually be a character.

(I looked up the names because most of them aren't memorable yet.)

&#x200B;

Greatest hits of locations in the film so far. The haunted Nockmar castle felt a little cheesy, but I did kind of enjoy what the spookiness of that episode was going for at least. Willow's village was a little lame, they never mentioend what happened to his wife and son, just that his daughter was still around.

I don't get Willow's ""i can't waste my magic ability."" Raziel said there was pain for beginners, not that you have to conserve your magic, and both her and bavmorda were old as hell and weren't dying from casting spells.  I thought they were going to have his abilities be bluster like he failed to actually develop his skills.. but where are they going with it?"
True Tunes,"Massively disappointed, won't bother with episode 3"
True Tunes,"Oh fuck off Reddit you guys just hate it when actual professional tv writers don‚Äôt take your desperate fanfic notes. Every show is shit to this site. Or golden-amazing-holy-shit-
-it‚Äôs-perfect. No middle ground."
True Tunes,Tried watching it 3 times... it sucks
True Tunes,"I'm a minute and twenty seconds into this video and unfortunately, he is 100% correct so far on everything.

It looks like a show that Disney threw a lot of money at but the script is awful and the cast is terrible."
True Tunes,Reddit bitch about every show not named Andor or HoD challenge‚Ä¶
True Tunes,"Oh I hate this youtuber.  He just craps on everything, and his critiques are so poorly founded sometimes.  He crapped on Wonder Woman because 'the amazons are supposed to be immortal and they're all different ages on the island.'  Like, suspend disbelief just a little?  Is the production company supposed to hire identically aged actresses (which is just stupid) to satisfy your 'immortality' criteria?  What's next, criticizing a mermaid because 'scientifically speaking' she should be transparent?!  We're talking about immortal amazons here..."
True Tunes,Disaster doesn't even begin to describe how bad it is
True Tunes,"Yeah it's bad, I'm a bit shocked at how bad."
True Tunes,"Spot on review. 
Ultimately - it‚Äôs for 2022 kids. 
At least the trailer felt promising."
True Tunes,"The show has ups and downs, but I enjoy it for what it is. My sister, dad, and I grew up watching the original Willow so it's a fun nostalgia trip for me."
True Tunes,"*female character exists* 
OMG what is with this WOKE obsession?!??? 
Crazy that you could dislike something so much yet continue to watch episodes of it‚Ä¶"
True Tunes,Haters gonna hate. I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot.
True Tunes,"Well, Drinker's mistake was thinking it's a Willow series. It's the MESSAGE, just packaged in another franchise...albeit a very obscure one. But they'll find and co-opt any and every franchise they can get their sinister hands on to try and shove the agenda in front of everyone."
True Tunes,The Critical Drinker is one of the most honest - and most politically incorrect - film and TV critics out there and I watch most of his streams. I have to agree with him most of the time.
True Tunes,So we‚Äôre posting Critical Dumbass vids now
True Tunes,"I made it about 30 minutes into the show, saw no magic. Looks like a Disney's kids show with a lot of teenage angst and drama and hormones. What the hell.. It should have started off strong with some kind of magic."
True Tunes,"Critical Drinker is a grifter that shits on movies and shows to sell his books and build his brand as some sort of intellectual anti-establishment film critic.

Wish people wouldn't promote his shit. He gets way too much attention as is."
True Tunes,Scathing reviews like this make me terrified to ever be a writer
True Tunes,"He lost me at diversity.  Everytime something has a diverse cast it's called woke by some jackass.  I wish these people would just admit to being sexist, homophobic and racist already so we can move on.  Oh wait, they did, the moment someone uses the word ""woke"" to complain.

Well he didn't use woke, he used other dog whistles, but whatever.  I see by the downvotes the dogwhistle is calling the dogs."
True Tunes,"this is a terrible synopsis

and I approve"
True Tunes,I saw the first episode and loved it. Idk.
True Tunes,"It‚Äôs a lot of fun. A bit messy, but fun."
True Tunes,"Oh, no :(. Worse than Rings of Power?"
True Tunes,I like it. Is it a masterpiece? No. But it's fun and I dig the fantasy camp.
True Tunes,Its good. People just have nothing better to do than shit all over everything because its what they are known for. Its like the you tube channels where people pretend theyve never heard music before and end up crying listening to guns n roses. Fucking go get a job.
True Tunes,"That is the sad state of media today, but at least it can get worse."
True Tunes,I learned a long time ago to disregard pretty much all reviews and just wait to see if a show is renewed for a 2nd season.
True Tunes,Won'tow
True Tunes,"Can't be worse than Witcher, Wheel of Time and Rings of Power."
True Tunes,"BWAHAHAHAHAH

>  The congealed filth encrusted manifestation of everything single thing wrong with modern entertainment. 

and 

>  So strong female character, Ginger plank of wood and a group of talentless diversity hires head out to beat the bad guy.

Too funny:

>  One thing this showed me was that Warrick Davis can't act anymore.

He never really could. He was the worst part of Willow the movie."
True Tunes,Can't stand the critical cunt and his awful content. What an annoying voice.
True Tunes,What do we got in our ass?.... it was Willow. Who knew?
True Tunes,"Maybe I was just sleepy but I made it less than 20 minutes into the first episode and woke up at the start of the second episode. I didn't even notice I was in episode two because the characters were still smarming it up and hanging around in the castle waiting for the adventure to start.

What little I saw was the worst kind of show, completely bland, no highs or lows at all."
True Tunes,"The movie had a dark, grimy edge to it.  I wish they'd kept that.  This aside, I've found it watchable but not too great."
True Tunes,It's fine.
True Tunes,Some things are simply a product of their time and place and just dont work when made for modern audiences. Willow is definitely one of those things.
True Tunes,Dude has an insufferable voice.
True Tunes,"so far I like willow better. I watched all of season 1 of Andor and I am still not sure who the hero was. certainly not the main character, he is a cold blooded killer. Sure, he is in a system that sucks, but why couldn't the hero be someone who was good?"
True Tunes,I hated the movie. It doesn‚Äôt do it for me. Though even I know this kind of criticism is just click bait stupidity. Let people enjoy what they want (even if it is cheesy fantasy stuff)
True Tunes,"I had never seen the original Willow movie but so far I am digging the TV show! The only issues I've had is that they do a bad job of explaining what happened in the movie, they will throw out a name and I won't know if I'm supposed know who that is or not."
True Tunes,"I was really excited for Willow. I was looking forward to the sweet adventure story....

....and then the first episode was all drama, angst, lesbian love story.

So I turned it off and went and watched Willow proper instead."
True Tunes,The anti woke guy again? Lol yeesh
True Tunes,"I do not care what the OnlyMans industrial complex thinks about anything. I mean, they don't even actually think it, this shit is the same script madlibbed over and over forever because rent's due."
True Tunes,"Every time someone starts a review by complaining about ""diversity"" you know that they're a fucking idiot"
True Tunes,They should have just branded it as a new season of Life‚Äôs Too Short.
True Tunes,I‚Äôm entertained by it but I can‚Äôt stand kit. Spoiled ass.
True Tunes,It's fun (expected) campy (expected) and gay (cool surprise). I don't really know what else people want/need it to be.
True Tunes,Once you go woke... You know the rest...
True Tunes,GIFFting is a pasion
True Tunes,Why does every swinging dick think that they need to state their opinion of things on YouTube? Is there anything in their lives that they actually appreciate?
True Tunes,If you didn‚Äôt read the books‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt comment on the lore or world building ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm guessing 90% of the people commenting didn‚Äôt know about them either.
True Tunes,Is this the new witcher show?
True Tunes,Nooooooo
True Tunes,I'm curious as to what the upvote/downvote demographics look for this.
True Tunes,Was that the queen from Snow White in there? LOL
True Tunes,The song is good though.
True Tunes,"I had little faith in the show after the first episode, but that was a pilot episode so those sometimes have flaws. The rest of the episodes have been much better, and I think it's worth watching. 

They toned down the teen drama bits, the characters are a bit more likeable, and the plot has enough potential to keep me engaged. Also seeing the Silas character stab people with knives was great. 

I can tell just skimming through this video that they focused a lot on the first episode, which was an objectively bad episode. I do fear for the shows success given how bad the first episode was, because I almost didn't watch the other episodes."
True Tunes,Willow is great! Haven't seen the new episode yet but I will when I get home.
True Tunes,I like the show.
True Tunes,Lately I've been having fun reading IGN reviews and then watching the Drinker's video on the same show.   The IGN review gave Willow a 9/10.  It was more like -9/10.
True Tunes,Complains about it amassing all that makes modern shows garbage while pointing out that source material is kinda crap.
True Tunes,"It‚Äôs a 5/10 at best. How they ruined the character progression and memory of Mad Martigen was terrible. The original Willow actors is the only reason this even gets 5 stars, otherwise it‚Äôs not entertaining in the least. Insincere, predictable, and the acting is terrible from anyone under 35 lol. BUT that‚Äôs just me, from someone that watched the original Willow as a kid in the 90‚Äôs. Maybe you will like it, I hope you do."
True Tunes,I think that it‚Äôs trying to gain a new audience. most of the original people who viewed it at some point over the last 20 years all expect the old language.   The cast of the non essentials is better then the essentials I feel.   They should have had at least boremier have some sort of old school vibe.   I have watched half of the series so far and I enjoy it with the flashbacks and scenes from the old movie.   BUT I just rewatched the movie and the writing is better.
True Tunes,The Rings of Power is complete trash and you have to cream your pants for Andor
True Tunes,"Wrong, Andor is the pinnacle of human existence"
True Tunes,"It really is f-ing terrible. I was so excited to watch and enjoy it, but it‚Äôs pretty much a bad riverdale."
True Tunes,"Especially anything that treats any women or minorities with any respect at all.

That triggers the fuck out of the people here. Especially the people here that dominate during what is night hours in the United States."
True Tunes,Except The Last Jedi. According to Reddit it‚Äôs a great film.
True Tunes,"I love the movie and I agree. People seemingly have distorted memories of Willow where it was this grand epic fantasy movie with tremendous world building.

The show is solid. I hope it gets better but it's no disaster."
True Tunes,The movie was awesome Val Kilmer absolutely crushed it. The show has been okay fun but warwicks acting is straight dogshit. He was so much better in the movie.
True Tunes,"I agree that it should be campy fun, but it feels like one of those young adult movies. That‚Äôs my main complaint."
True Tunes,"They basically destroyed any hope of anyone considering it a 'serious' movie by making fun of it constantly in LTS. It was the running joke of the show. Should have just kept it going as a comedy, or 'making of willow 2'."
Taco Chronicles,"I really loved this series as well. I do like some of the Chef's Table episodes, but this was so much more interesting/engaging."
Blown Away,"Everything on Apple TV+ feels like someone really cared about it. Not always to the best result, but stuff doesn't have that corporate manufactured feel."
Blown Away,You only get one shot‚Ä¶ Twice !
Blown Away,"They're working on a season 2, but I don't know much about it. I wouldn't look it up if you aren't done with season 1."
Blown Away,"I actually just watched it for first time over last few days too right after watching Detroiters for the first time. Noticed Sam Richardson was in Afterparty too so decided to give it a go.

Thought it was really good - liked the different perspectives all being a different type of genre, liked the characters and there were a lot of good actors in the cast, and thought the central mystery was well done."
Blown Away,I loved it. It‚Äôs so fun to watch.
Blown Away,"What a coincidence, I clicked play on a whim and ended up watching the season today"
Blown Away,That was a fun watch
Blown Away,When I start something with a mystery element there's a nagging feeling that maybe the ending will be disappointing because there's so much weight on the reveal. This one left me satisfied.
Blown Away,"Definitely watch the [music video](https://youtu.be/wIdmCpqCPWk) they did for it.

Miller (and Lord) do a great job of making catchy music for their stuff."
Blown Away,Such an amazing show. Can‚Äôt wait for season two. The Xavier music video and albums are brilliant.
Blown Away,"It was great but it was also very obvious who the killer was.  I hope they make a better mystery for Season 2.  
  
OP, if you haven't seen Black Bird make it the next one on your list."
Blown Away," > Ben Schwartz is particularly fantastic 

Oh you think so?"
Blown Away,The Apple astroturfing is unreal on this sub.
Blown Away,It's so great! I'm looking forward to the next season!
Blown Away,I wasn‚Äôt blown away but I enjoyed it.
Blown Away,"Sam Richardson is a treasure, and should be in a lot more stuff. (And hopefully not in stuff that gives away the ending in the first ten minutes.)"
Blown Away,"That's a good way to put it yea. A lot of different things so you won't like everything, but there's a high quality to it that you don't see on Disney+, Prime or Netflix to the same degree."
Blown Away,"Outside of Mr. Gorman, which had some good acting and scenes but otherwise was meandering and plotless, everything I have watched on Apple has been great

I love For All Mankind and Foundation among other shows (severance, ted lasso etc.). They make good TV."
Blown Away,"I feel they are the one place that just gives talent a big check and says ‚Äúgo nuts‚Äù. At the moment they don‚Äôt care about ratings they just care about reputation.  We love a lot of their shows.  

The Morning Show had an awful second season and we dropped it though."
Blown Away,S2 comes out Apr 28!
Blown Away,"I know Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, and Z√∂e Chao are returning, in addition to this new cast:

- Elizabeth Perkins as Isabel
- Zach Woods as Edgar
- Paul Walter Hauser as Travis
- Poppy Liu as Grace
- Anna Konkle as Hannah
- Jack Whitehall as Sebastian
- Vivian Wu as Vivian
- Ken Jeong as Feng
- John Cho as Ulysses"
Blown Away,Yeah it was a real fun show to watch.  Even more fun when you go back and see the clues they planted throughout the series.
Blown Away,"I just finished it and I agree. Even tho i picked the perp, there were a ton of red flags I missed."
Blown Away,"They also released the character's mini album. 4 songs:

* [Imma Live Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjmmBbQA4Us)

* [Just Like U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhwrqjgD78)

* [Do Wet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAu775_BAKI)

* [X Marks the G Spot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk-xIU0OvVc)"
Blown Away,"Now that I finished the season, I have to admit your comment was unfortunately a spoiler for me. Mad at myself for posting before I finished. However, looking back - my sentence about Ben is very funny."
Blown Away,"Yea that has to be it. Definitely not the fact that their content is of high quality across the board and is being noticed, at the same time there's a lot of low effort, low quality new content from Disney+, Netflix and Prime."
Blown Away,üôÑ
Blown Away,"Disney+ and Amazon Prime are the epitome of that ""corporate manufactured feel."" They're releasing primarily lifeless crap nowadays."
Blown Away,"Haddish is still getting work after her very unwholesome skit last year?  That's gonna be a yikes from me, dog.  Shame, too, the musical episode of S1 still lives rent-free in my head with that ""You only get one shot, twice"" song.  Guess I'll have to sail to my friend's house to watch S2 on his account so that none of my subscriber fees goes into Haddish's royalty checks."
Blown Away,Take out Whitehall and that's a great cast.
Blown Away,"well, that sold me on the show

Hauser's performance in Black Bird bought enough good will for me to check him out in more things"
Blown Away,"Did you figure out who the killer was?  I was downvoted for saying it, but it was very obvious.  They were the only one that didn't have a matching story.  That one character's events were almost completely fictional."
Blown Away,honestly it doesn't really matter who the killer was by the end of the season.
Blown Away,There are tons of good shows on FX but you'll never see such posts for FX because they don't hire astroturf squads. HBO is a different class so it getting praises definitely makes sense. AppleTV+? Not so much. Plue Apple TV+ has less than 1% viewership in the US. So who the fuck is watching these shows?
Blown Away,"It was filmed, or had already started filming before the news broke about her. I hope they don't bring her for season 3 if there is one"
Blown Away,Bruh I saw posts about The Bear out the ass when that was airing. People definitely talk about FX shows here
Blown Away,">	There are tons of good shows on FX but you‚Äôll never see such posts for FX

A lot of people get long free subs to Apple TV+ with new devices. To watch FX I‚Äôd either need to have cable or know about FXNow‚Ä¶which I only know about because I just googled it now."
Blown Away,What other FX show has got that much traction here? Almost none unless you count 'Mr. Inbetween' which is an older series.
Blown Away,">	. To watch FX I‚Äôd either need to have cable or know about FXNow‚Ä¶which I only know about because I just googled it now.

Hulu"
Blown Away,"Just recently, Reservation Dogs got its well-deserved fair share of love and 'traction' on here. A lot of people went to bat for Under the Banner of Heaven when it was airing and soon after, and while The Old Man and Fleishman Is in Trouble didn't break through as strongly, I still see them recommended from time to time.

Otherwise - Fargo, Always Sunny, Archer, What We Do in the Shadows, The Americans, Justified, Atlanta, Legion and The Shield all have massive fan bases on this sub and are talked about very, very often. Lesser mentioned but no less loved series like You're the Worst, Devs, Baskets, Dave and Better Things are also mentioned consistently.

You're just wrong. People are just excited about the quality-first brand Apple TV+ is currently building. People have been impressed with the quality FX brand for a lot longer."
Blown Away,Legion is literally mentioned twice in the sub's sidebar.
Blown Away,"I haven't watched the show recently (though I caught the Gutenberg cameo at the end of this week's episode as it was leading in to Abbott Elementary).

For the bigger stars, I feel like it's a mix of most simply being available and willing to tread on the nostalgia. 

For those ""personal"" cameos in the early years, though, I think its just how genuine the show's creator was about telling stories from his life with a bit of heightened humor. He wanted people from his life to be a part of his journey ""back home"" and it resonated with people.

I'll aways remember him casting his real life ""first girlfriend"" as the character's first girlfriend's mom. It says a lot that she wanted to be part of that nostalgia, and that he was big enough to ask."
Blown Away,"That show pretty much just takes something from the 80s and creates an episode from it. At best, it‚Äôs an ok show, but there is nothing special about it."
Blown Away,I avoid this show.....the two brothers are annoying to me....sorry I don't share your taste in sitcoms
Blown Away,"Such a good show.

Show me a sitcom from last decade better than Goldberg's."
Blown Away,The show was great at the beginning and got progressively worse over time.  It is still entertaining but they should have ended the series when Adam graduated high school.  They seem to really be stretching for storylines lately.
Blown Away,Modern Family was created 4 years earlier and I feel is the stronger show.
Blown Away,Uhmmm‚Ä¶tons. One being Community?
Blown Away,yea the writers are really trying anything to keep the kids in that house
Blown Away,"It's a great show.  You're probably correct.  Love them both, but because I was around back then I like Goldberg's more."
Blown Away,"I should have prefaced ""family"" sitcom.

Goldberg's is a treat to watch with the kids, Community is for young adults."
Blown Away,"Ahh gotcha. 

I‚Äôd also say Community is for practically all adults."
Blown Away,"I wasn't blown away by HoTD like the rest of reddit, either. Its pacing made it really hard to invest in the characters and the story."
Blown Away,"This kind of feels like when someone gets mad that the new release from their favourite massive global mega-star doesn't get ""best album of the year"". Why do you even care about critical respect, the show is already super popular. It seems to me that what you really want is for these random websites to reassure you of your own superiority of taste and refinement because you like something that has mass appeal"
Blown Away,The lists are subjective. The people writing them didn't much care for House of the Dragon. It's that simple.
Blown Away,Oh God. Seriously?
Blown Away,"Short answer:  The show is successful, but not the the extent the Reddit echo chamber indicates it to be. Yeah if you relentlessly downvote and voices who disagree, claim any article critical of it is some paid hitjob by Amazon (even when it's like, a career respected critic) and upvote any article that says ""Matt Smith says finale will be cool"" you're going to be shocked at the gap between what you see here and what you see in the rest of the world. 


People like different things.  We can enjoy different media without letting it become our personalities."
Blown Away,Which shows listed do you think dont deserve to be?
Blown Away,"The Bear doesn't even have one goddamn bear the whole series, it deserves nothing until we get the bear."
Blown Away,"Right, it's crazy.  FBI and NCIS Hawaii are not on any of these lists.

It's like these lists were made by people who have no idea what good television is.  Or they just have their own opinions that are worth just their opinion."
Blown Away,The House of Dragon just wasn't that good.
Blown Away,"I've noticed that too, but these lists are subjective and honestly not a big deal at all fam. It's just something fun to do and read. 

I'm gonna make my yearly top 25 tv list soon and it probably won't have House of the Dragon on it either... but that doesn't mean anything, just one person's opinion."
Blown Away,I thought HotD was miles better than RoP but I'm guessing that Game of Thrones wore out its welcome. It's probably a deliberate exclusion.
Blown Away,"It is odd though, I agree. HoTD has been well-received pretty much across the board, AVclub is smoking high almighty with that list though. Ms. Marvel? Rings of Power?? Personally was bored to tears with Andor and was unimpressed with The Rehearsal (I am a fan of Nathan's dry ass humor too). But its all subjective in the end. Who tf cares. They're all shilled-out."
Blown Away,How does one access the list?
Blown Away,"Yeah but I hear that RoP was on some of these lists. 

If so then I get the irritation. 

Personally I haven‚Äôt been putting stock into what certain critics say for years given how subjective their opinions are."
Blown Away,"Lol the bottom says ""proof of negligence.""  Something aboiut HoTD specifically makes the superfans crazy."
Blown Away,bracing for impact but: barry. this season wasn't close to the previous and if it wasn't for those earlier seasons it wouldn't be spoken of so highly.
Blown Away,"I haven't seen every single show mentioned, but to name a few: Rings of Power, The Rehearsal, Derry Girls, Industry. I'm not saying those shows aren't good (or that all the shows on these lists aren't good for that matter) but the idea that House of the Dragon isn't among the best shows of the year is absurd to me."
Blown Away,Not everyone thought HotD deserved a top 10 or top 30. You can make your list and post it on Twitter too.
Blown Away,"Those shows absolutely deserve their place on these lists IMO, the rehearsal especially. Of course I wouldnt call your opinion or the fact you havent even seen some of the shows youre talking about negligent."
Blown Away,You really think The Rings of Power deserves a spot?
Blown Away,I wouldnt call someone who does think that negligent.
Blown Away,Absolutely. Top 5 for me.
Blown Away,That's not what I asked.
Blown Away,Did you only watch 5 shows?
Blown Away,I think if someone wants to put it on their list it deserves the spot on the list. Thats how individual lists like these work.
Blown Away,"Nope, just really loved the show."
Blown Away,That's also not what I asked lol
Blown Away,Then what are you asking? I said the show deserves a spot on those peoples individual lists and you asked if I really think that so I answered that yes if someone wants to put it on their list it deserves the spot. Are you attempting to ask me for my personal top ten list? I can see that youre just here to tell people their personal opinions are wrong or laughable.
Blown Away,"Seeing as you were saying that it ""absolutely deserved a spot"", I figured there was a bit more to it, than just ""I their list, so what ever they put on it, deserves to be there.""

If everyone argued like you, you could literally never discuss anything, because everything would just begin and end at ""It's my opinion, and that's final."""
Blown Away,The whole season was sub standard comparing to the  other seasons. It just kept getting worse too. Like they sent all good artists hime early on and especially the judgement of episode 4. Made no sense whatsoever. Why would they keep the sloth guy for so long. I just dont get it. Bad season but still watched it for glass blowing
Blown Away,The worst part about the show is the hosts. I‚Äôm only on episode 1 right now but their interactions are so fake and forced. Delayed laughing. The old winner too is not a good host or judge.
Blown Away,Dude got robbed on the second to last episode.. the dead chick that fell from the nest was horrible to me.. and the skull on the episode before that not that great either.. I was‚Ä¶ blown away.. when they sent other John home
Blown Away,"So many pieces (especially by the winner) looked so awful. They reminded me alot of those kindergarten pottery class creations made by 5 year olds. Horrible structure, terrifyingly blotchy coloring, rushed and just poorly done pieces that the judges just raved over.

Eliminations made zero sense half the time. Clean well made pieces were sent home for bullshit reasons, while poorly made, frightening looking pieces were kept on. 

I almost broke my neck from the whiplash when during the showing they spent most of it shitting on the awful bird piece (that looked like a child made it) and then they crown it the best of the bunch?!  And sent home a really nicely made piece with no real explanation as to why.

And the winning finale piece? Neither of them were truly awe inspiring but the wrong project won. I couldn't believe it when they were going off about how impressive the bunny was, while interjected shots of one of the ugliest pieces of glass that's ever been featured on the show."
Blown Away,"As an artist myself, the weakest part of the show is the hosts. They are not judging things with the right attitude at all. They are also classically arrogant and not acting like artists. With most contest shows I watch, the hosts usually make the right decision for the right reasons. Here? I nearly yell at my computer at their choices"
Blown Away,"SPOILER!!! 



MINNIE WAS ROBBED AT THE END. I‚Äôm so incredibly frustrated at the judging. John‚Äôs laziness won him a residency."
Blown Away,"I just finished the entire season. They really need new judges! The season 3 judging made no sense and ruined the show. I hope there‚Äôs a season 4, but with new judges/ host."
Blown Away,The guy who won didn't make anything that even looked like glass. It was all overly textured. In the group competition he basically told the other guy what they were gonna do and he just went along with it. The skull piece looked terrible (the teeth looked particularly bad) while the alien lifeform demonstrated a number of different techniques with no obvious flaws. The judging is way too biased. The lady seems to play favorites. Watching season 3 actually stressed me out.
Blown Away,Episode 4 elimation made no sense
Blown Away,"I think the winner of this season should have went home at the start, that shoe piece ?!? wtf was that. And then they do the other John dirty like he didnt make the dopest telescope in the world. Meanwhile Minhi consistently showed up and grew as an artist. What a bad season, not the mention the BS ""stealing"" another artist style boot that happened. I mean shit I guess I cant use arithmetic because someone else invented it hur dur dur. And lets not even talk about the non binary winning residency, when there was clearly better artist than her who deserved it more. Im seriously disappointed in the judging, the winner this season was wack and shouldnt have made it past the shoe episode."
Blown Away,"The judges are the worst part of the show, and the show as a whole suffers because of it. Kicking off an artist because you think their work is too derivative was a mistake to me, and it just gave me the impression that the leads of the glass blowing community are probably just a bunch of pretentious assholes. But surprisingly, that was one of the least offensive moments of judging. It became very clear by episode 4 that they were judging based on reputation and personal preference, not on artistic vision or technical skill. I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with who won, but I disagree with who made it to the back half of the show. The actual judging sucks, and the judges personalities aren‚Äôt much better. 

Compare this with a show like Lego Masters. I‚Äôm waiting on tippy-toes for more Lego Masters. Will Arnett and two upbeat, young professionals hosting a show about a hobby that I can only kind of relate to is infinitely more watchable than a show hosted by generic white guy #5, and judged by a woman who seems like she would rather be anywhere else in the world but on that set. On Lego masters, Brick Master Amy loves her job. She loves building with Legos, she loves watching people create something new, and she gets excited when she sees something that really BLOWS HER AWAY. Glass Master Katherine Grey, who has a serious talent for glass work and should be incredibly passionate about new glass artists and art, is cruising in neutral whether she likes a piece or not. It‚Äôs the same emotional reaction to every piece, even on pieces that I would literally theme an entire room around if I had them in my house. I‚Äôm watching on TV, I don‚Äôt even get to look at it from all the angles in 3D, and somehow I‚Äôm more BLOWN AWAY than she ever is. Somebody needs to get her a coffee, or some Sativa before she comes onto set or something, because I feel like I would really like this show if our Glass Master didn‚Äôt seem like she was on Ambien every time she‚Äôs on screen."
Blown Away,"Doesn‚Äôt seem as creative as the other seasons.  Not sure if that‚Äôs because of less inspired challenges, less time, or it‚Äôs just the people. But not blown away."
Blown Away,"Half of the episodes in the 3rd season, I wasn‚Äôt agreeing with the winners at allllll. The last episode was just infuriating. No way that person won. A ¬´¬†maximalist¬†¬ª is the stupidest thing said in that episode. And the return of Deborah in the first episode as a self-righteous pedantic bitch, I cannot stand her for a second. Didactic. Bitch you make eggs. Nothing more obvious than a sunny-side up egg."
Blown Away,"Episode 5 decision was stupid, guest judges have way too much sway. An olive that's dead-on the color of an apple is fine but too brown popcorn is out of the question?!"
Blown Away,"Please tell me it's not going to be 10 episodes of Deborah labeling everyone's art as ""didactic, literal, pedestrian, basic and derivative"". She sounds like some beatnik from an Audrey Hepburn movie."
Blown Away,"I personally did not care much for all the sculpted, opaque glass in this season.  The judging system is terrible; a better system could be to include two ""professional"" judges, along with the special guest, and the host's opinion should always be treated without any weight."
Blown Away,John sharan was robbed by minhis sob story
Blown Away,I just watch it for moments like ‚Äúso you live to blow another day‚Äù
Blown Away,"So. I binged all three seasons And, I came for the amazing artistry and beauty. Like, every single season, completely BLOWN AWAY. But, HOW is this a competition show?? Katherine Gray is some kind of expert? Her art looks like amateur hour compared to these artists--look at her ""clown series""--and Nick Uhas--who is he...exactly?  An MTV host? I feel ashamed for the glass blowers, who are so incredibly talented, to have Nick deem their piece to be ""awesome"" or ""terrible"" when he has zero credibility to judge such things? And yet, his voice carries the same weight as all the judges? I don't get it."
Extreme Engagement,"Emmy Rossum was the one who suggested Rami Malek for the role of Elliot in the show. 

I can't remember if it was Rami who said this during a late night talk show or Emmy who said this during a radio interview, but she's the one who hooked him up!"
Extreme Engagement,Thanks for making me hate Sam Esmail
Extreme Engagement,"Not sure what's interesting about it. Hollywood people date Hollywood people, pretty much par for the course."
Extreme Engagement,"He wrote and directed ""Comet"" which she was in with Justin Long. I don't know if many people have seen since the cover just looks like a generic romance flick but it's a nice take on the subject and I would recommend it. "

Extreme Engagement,"Actress dates producer/writer/director. Wow, that's never happened before with Luc Besson and Milla Jovovich, James Cameron and Linda Hamilton, Cash Warren and Jessica Alba, Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe... how truly exceptional. 

If you think this is interesting, there's some paint drying you might want to look at for a while. This has nothing to do with either's workload or future projects, if it's in Us Weekly and not Variety it probably shouldn't be here. "
Extreme Engagement,/u/SamEsmail they are talking about you
Extreme Engagement,I think it was Rami on Jimmy Fallon
Extreme Engagement,"Huh, no kidding? I was unaware. Thanks for not being a hater."
Extreme Engagement,"Heh, why? I take it you don't like Emmy Rossum."
Extreme Engagement,"I found it interesting, a bit, and some others here have a similar mindset as me, I've found. Hate all you want."
Extreme Engagement,"Noice, thanks for the recommendation."
Extreme Engagement,"> ""teehee im such a slutty whore""

What the fuck?  She's sexualized for sure and has issues in the relationship department but none of her storylines are, 'teehee im such a slutty whore'.  The entire last season she was engaged to be married for fucks sake.  The only slutty whore on that show is really Lip.  "
Extreme Engagement,Read the title again- no extreme import. I just found it an interesting little bit of TV gossip that a few others may not have been aware of. No big deal.
Extreme Engagement,"I didn't catch that, but it wouldn't be the first time. I am often talked about. Is that actually Sam Esmail posting?? If so, fucking groovy."
Extreme Engagement,[removed]
Extreme Engagement,"Yeah, that's not entirely true.  And seriously seems a *little* bit misogynistic towards Fiona, especially given how promiscuous every single character on that show is."
Extreme Engagement,[deleted]
Extreme Engagement,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Extreme Engagement,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Extreme Engagement,"How you pick what to watch? I‚Äôm overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn‚Äôt much write-ups or reviews in English."
Extreme Engagement,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Extreme Engagement,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Extreme Engagement,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Extreme Engagement,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Extreme Engagement,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Extreme Engagement,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Extreme Engagement,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Extreme Engagement,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Extreme Engagement,Which ones did you see? ü§î amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Extreme Engagement,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Extreme Engagement,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Extreme Engagement,üôÇüíï
Extreme Engagement,It‚Äôs great but it‚Äôs depressing.
Extreme Engagement,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Extreme Engagement,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Extreme Engagement,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Extreme Engagement,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7‚Ä¶ cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Extreme Engagement,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Extreme Engagement,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Extreme Engagement,Oh my bad. I‚Äôm late to the party.
Extreme Engagement,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Extreme Engagement,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Extreme Engagement,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Extreme Engagement,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven‚Äôt managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Extreme Engagement,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Extreme Engagement,"The people behind Gurren Lagann , Redline, and Kill La Kill *surprisingly* made a good anime"
Extreme Engagement,why surprisingly ? Trigger is a known studio
Extreme Engagement,"I liked it too! Good music and action sequences, and while the romance was OK I liked how they kept the plot focused on the risk and consequences of Cyberpsychosis.

 >!Near the end I was right there with David thinking he was truly unique and capable of taking on the world, then Smasher just instantly demolishes him. He fooled himself into thinking he was able to beat the corps, but that's not how Cyberpunk works. In the end he was just another broken killing machine like all the gangbangers he'd killed in his career.!<"
Extreme Engagement,"The track selections for the soundtrack are perfect, I think trigger being able to take advantage of all the work done for the game really helped elevate it."
Extreme Engagement,"Definitely stayed with me for a while after I watched it. Episode 6 and 10s endings especially, I must have rewatched those two episodes a dozen times each. As is tradition with studio trigger their use of music was on point, and the animation was really good(in some areas). 


It's greater than the sum of it's parts, there are a couple of minor things here and there, but overall it's a really good series with a couple of characters ill probably never forget and a number of scenes ill absolutely never forget."
Extreme Engagement,"It was pretty nova nova, choom!"
Extreme Engagement,"This makes two fantastic video game tie in animations. Arcane and Cyberpunk.

What will be the adaption to fuck it all up?

For those of you who haven't been following, Cyberpunk 2077 has had a huge jump in players since the game released. From ~ten thousand to [eighty](https://steamcharts.com/app/1091500) thousand active players. I would be surprised if we don't start to see a trend of game release and six-twelve months later a tie in show to jump sales again.

Edit: Two years post release Cyberpunk has [surpassed](https://twitter.com/BenjiSales/status/1573652769323589633) the all time highest concurrent players of the Witcher 3."
Extreme Engagement,"I liked it, only issue I had is that when playing the game the ultra violent world doesn't seem as intense as it does in series form, when watching the show I can't help but think to my self 'who the fuck would live in this night mare of city'... that said I would still like to see more shows done in this universe... maybe something more corpo focused next time."
Extreme Engagement,It got me to reinstall the game lol
Extreme Engagement,i like it too. shit went hard.
Extreme Engagement,It gives me nostalgia for 90s style anime.
Extreme Engagement,"Some dialogs felt too clunky and obviously there for exposition. Like that talk of the mother with her son in the car ‚Ä¶ i get that you want all the best for your son and that you‚Äôre living in a society where it‚Äôs hard to get out of poverty, but don‚Äôt spell it out like that. 

Other than that, i liked the plot, even the over the top style, which I‚Äôm not a fan of (that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt watch a lot of anime) was not very distracting. 
Overall 7 / 10"
Extreme Engagement,"Cyberpunk: Edgerunners

rating:5 out 10

can tell they spend alot of money and effort. I like the anime style and the world designed and music. But character development and mid-end story are so trash."
Extreme Engagement,"7.5, the fuck is wrong with you? The show is definitely 9 or higher, you could mislead people with such a low rating."
Extreme Engagement,is it better than Arcane? I haven't watched it yet
Extreme Engagement,"This post covers a lot of the great and bad qualities and I agree it is really strong. However - from a feminist lens we are still pretty oriented around the male gaze when it comes to any women character, including the loli characters. I get it's ""anime"", but it was produced by a major gaming studio in Poland who hired an outside studio, these elements could have been altered and avoided.  
  
As a woman now in her thirties it's been hard to stay into anime because of how careless it is with it's women characters. Just so boring these days and I was hoping Edgerunner would be different on that front. :/"
Extreme Engagement,"The biggest weak point: the animation. 

I understand they save money/time by animating fewer frames. But wow.

Sometimes several seconds would go by without movement on screen. I thought the TV was broken.

I suppose this IS common with serial anime though."
Extreme Engagement,"Disagree. I'm familiar with Trigger's works,and this is legitimately one of their worst shows ever. Perhaps one of the worst animes of all time."
Extreme Engagement,Purposefully trimming faces/mouths out of the screen or showing characters from behind/from a distance to minimise animation just struck me as so obviously lazy that it killed my interest.
Extreme Engagement,"It's good but this sub has massively overrated it over it over the last week or so. A video game based show with excessive nudity, it's practically red meat for this site"
Extreme Engagement,[removed]
Extreme Engagement,">Cyberpunk: Edgerunners has the set-up, stakes and consequences that viewers could find relatable in terms of their own reality. 

I don't understand why people say the most ludicrously unrealistic of shows are ""relatable to reality"". Like when people talk about Breaking Bad/BCS being a realistic portrayal of criminals, or Game of Thrones, other anime as having ""relatable characters"". Do they just not observe their own reality or are they trying to make their own seem more interesting than what it actually is?"
Extreme Engagement,I'm tired of the skull/face crushing with this animation studio. They do it for shock value.  It's getting tiresome.
Extreme Engagement,couldn't get past 10 min mark with all the yapping and yelping.  a hard pass.
Extreme Engagement,Stop.
Extreme Engagement,Unsurprisingly I give no fucks. That game ruined gaming for me. I hope that studio burns down
Extreme Engagement,"Are the events of this show supposed to take place before the video game?

If so, should I watch the show before playing the game?"
Extreme Engagement,"The show was enjoyable enough to watch, but not something I'll go back to binge again. I think the highlight or me were the character designs. All very distinct, creative and fun. Even with some characters who appear in both the game and the show, the studio was able to make their depictions just different enough to be fresh. It was also nice to see the minimally modded getaway driver, Falco, holding his own amongst all these chromed out punks.  


Two things that bugged me about the show though were:  
1) The cars and trucks are animated very ""jankily"", they bounce around and move very unrealistically, feels like it's just a kid throwing hot wheels around rather than multi-ton futuristic cars.  
2) ""Military Spec"" Cyberware are major plot devices in the show... but we never see actual military/law enforcement personnel with any mods whatsoever. Weird."
Extreme Engagement,This show was so mid its just like any other typical anime L anime tbh no development L
Extreme Engagement,lucy not even hot
Extreme Engagement,"Isn't Redline by Madhouse, or is there some staff overlap?"
Extreme Engagement,"Little Witch Academia, BNA, and Promare, too."
Extreme Engagement,Yeah like what's this guy think he discovered some obscure studios obscure anime?
Extreme Engagement,"> surprisingly made a good anime

Based off an IP most people had written off as a failure...CP77's steam numbers are way up and people are paying attention the franchise again in a positive way...Trigger knocked it way out of the park in a way no one expected."
Extreme Engagement,"Oh they made Gurren Lagann? At this point I need to get me Kill La Kill, I heard it was good but I am not much into anime unless they are really just great"
Extreme Engagement,Very true but this time CDPR did the co-writing so besides animation their anime finally have a decent story.
Extreme Engagement,"You say that as though Gurren and Kill La Kill weren't just...Terrible.

Redline, a fucking masterpiece."
Extreme Engagement,Surprising because video game adaptations usually kinda suck.
Extreme Engagement,"Yeah, but only known to anime fans. The average television watcher here wouldn't know what TRIGGER is."
Extreme Engagement,Because it initially looked like it could easily be just a forgettable video game tie-in with flashy animation.
Extreme Engagement,Surprising because trigger anime usually suck ass
Extreme Engagement,David was still a great character. More likable than the literal cardboard that is V
Extreme Engagement,The song during >!Maine's death!< is so fucking perfect.
Extreme Engagement,You forgot Castlevania AKA the original good Netflix video game anime.
Extreme Engagement,"Don't forget ""Dota: Dragon's Blood"". I feel like it deserves more attention."
Extreme Engagement,"> I would be surprised if we don't start to see a trend of game release and six-twelve months later a tie in show to jump sales again.

Ironically that's not far off from the common anime model in Japan where shows get made to help boost manga / light novel sales."
Extreme Engagement,The Last of Us is attempting the very same thing.
Extreme Engagement,"Technically, pokemon"
Extreme Engagement,Cyberpunk really isn‚Äôt a video game adaptation. It‚Äôs adjacent. It‚Äôs adapting the table top game.
Extreme Engagement,"It's kind of weird seeing people talk like Edgerunners has been a big success. The show lasted 3 days in the Top 10 in countries like the UK and US, and was out of the Top 10 in most countries within a week or so.

This doesn't have any bearing on the quality of the show, and I'm sure the PR helped the game's sales, but there's some very odd correlation =? causation stuff going on here, and people seem to be outright ignoring how (relatively) unpopular the show is. It opened low (14.8 million view hours), and has shown absolutely no legs."
Extreme Engagement,"I dont like anime and have no intention of watching cyberpunk, but my prediction is the ark 2 anime will fuck it up lol."
Extreme Engagement,"I like the show, but still wouldn't play the game. It would just be a step down from the anime."
Extreme Engagement,"The scene in the first episode where the bully punched quickly yelling ""yaaa-da-da-da-da-da..."" was right out of Fist of the Northstar"
Criminal Justice,Can Disney stop dropping the ball with the dates of (Hot)Star/FX/non-English content?
Criminal Justice,"the show also doubles as a peak into the messed up foster care system, and how little freedom and ceiling she had."
Criminal Justice,I‚Äôm always on board with anything Toni Collette
Criminal Justice,"I highly recommend the excellent long-form article this series is based on - [An Unbelievable Story of Rape](https://www.propublica.org/article/false-rape-accusations-an-unbelievable-story). It‚Äôs just staggering what Marie went through (and what other women went through because she wasn‚Äôt believed) and how it was almost never solved. The police originally investigating Marie‚Äôs rape have a LOT to answer for, as does Marie‚Äôs foster mother. I‚Äôd like to watch the series but I think it would make me too angry."
Criminal Justice,"This show was really good , Kaitlyn dever and Merrit wever deserve some awards."
Criminal Justice,Seeing Marie take the mental torture from so many directions in the series hurts the heart.
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,Binged the whole damn thing last night. Excellent show.
Criminal Justice,Merritt Wever is a national treasure!
Criminal Justice,"The whole principal cast brings it, but I was really impressed with Merrit Weaver, who I was familiar with but had never actually seen in anything substantial"
Criminal Justice,This was an amazing watch. Highly recommend it.
Criminal Justice,"This was so good. I mean it was horrible, but such an important window into a terrible situation. Teaching, I saw so many kids with her temperament. Just absolute loss of trust for authority or faith in their support groups. It was tragic. I still get messages from old students who just want to ask me about college, life, whatever. And I live in a diverse, upscale area with tons of resources. What is that saying about kids challenges elsewhere?"
Criminal Justice,"‚ÄúAh ya!!  What‚Äôs your email address Detective?  I have a photo we found in the position of our suspect‚Äù

How on the edge of your seat were you for that scene?"
Criminal Justice,"This show was really good , Kaitlyn dever and Merrit wever deserve some awards."
Criminal Justice,I accidentally started the show at 7 AM Saturday morning (I had not read or heard anything about it). Did not even get up to eat breakfast till the show ended. What a hard hitting story!
Criminal Justice,"Shout out to CBS Studios who is the studio on this, they produce a lot of the shows you love but never knew they made (e.g. Dead To Me)"
Criminal Justice,Merritt Weaver is amazing in this
Criminal Justice,"I watched the series this evening and cried start to finish. It broke something in me and I sobbed for Marie, my sisters, my mom and mostly myself. All victims/survivors of sexual assault and in my case disbelief and blame from ""friends"". But I had my mom who helped best she could so I'm luckier than Marie. I never did pursue any kind of justice or anything after a friend said I shouldn't have been where I was and I was basically asking for it. Figured I wouldn't have been taken seriously. 22 years later I break down watching Unbelievable because it's so relatable."
Criminal Justice,"If it wasn't for **Chernobyl** this would be my TV series of the year.

Something I haven't seen commented upon is the discomfort caused by the forensic specialist taking specimens of hair etc from the rapist. It's incredibly uncomfortable viewing as our (at the time suspected) rapist is compelled to submit to a humiliating and degrading examination.

It's an interesting choice that this process is shown in detail and is a reversal of the usual position (as shown in the opening episode) of how rape victims are humiliated by their ordeal and re-brutalised by the subsequent examinations conducted for forensic purposes after their ordeal.

Having the most explicit humiliation be that of the (at the time suspected) rapist is a powerful riposte."
Criminal Justice,"My friend turned this on randomly the other night, and I ended up watching 3 episodes completely unable to look away. The way the cops treat Marie is absolutely heinous, and it's so infuriating to know the insanity that so many women have to go through just to report a crime."
Criminal Justice,"I‚Äôm only a couple episodes in but wow, what a powerful show.  The contrast between the 1st and 2nd episode is.. mind blowing."
Criminal Justice,"Just finished this show. Absolutely incredible. Such a powerful, important story, told with such sensitivity and compassion. Had me glued to the television from start to finish. Well done to everyone involved in this project. You should be very, very proud."
Criminal Justice,"I see Toni Colette, I get excited immediately."
Criminal Justice,"I watched just the intro play thing of this & started bawling. This happened to me, this HAPPENED to me at age 11. My husband said he heard the concept & was worried I'd stumble onto alone, he wanted to make sure he was there when I just watched the intro. I don't think I can watch this show... Being a rape survivor isn't nearly as difficult as being a victim of an unfair system.

Also I was fucking 11, I didn't know what you meant by ""you're not acting like a rape victim."" 11, I didn't know how to act like anything except an 11 year old."
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,"Got 2 episodes left in this series and my girlfriend and I are really enjoying it.  Which is weird to say, because it makes us both very uncomfortable.  You just feel so bad for Marie.  I've found myself saying out loud ""You're all gonna feel like shit when the truth comes out and you treated her like that!"""
Criminal Justice,Watched the first 2 episodes. Too fucking depressing.
Criminal Justice,"For people that only watch the first episode.

The first episode is nothing like the rest of the show. The rest of the show is basically a detective show and an incredible one at that. I know it's based on true events but I do think it was dramatised to make it viewable and watchable for the public.

Incredible show and performances."
Criminal Justice,Oh Toni Collette is in this? I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll put in an amazing performance and get completely ignored for awards.
Criminal Justice,"I‚Äôve read the article that this Netflix series was based on three or four times. It‚Äôs just amazing. And the Netflix series does very well with it. Obviously they went a little bit beyond the scope of the article to develop their characters and stuff, but it was really well done."
Criminal Justice,This show is so goddamn hard to watch. I can't even imagine living through that kind of waking nightmare. This series is messing with me harder than any horror story ever could.
Criminal Justice,This show is fantastic but I have to say it is *extremely* triggering if you‚Äôve been assaulted and accused of lying.  Just a heads up.  It really messed me up but I‚Äôm still glad I saw it.
Criminal Justice,Anyone know what ended up being on the hard drive? It was never disclosed in the show
Criminal Justice,I think I've never felt as sorry for a fictional character as I did for that girl. I found myself thinking of her alot throughout my day. Netflix gave her a nice happy ending but in real life not everyone gets an unrelenting advocate and a check for a hundred grand. I thought this was such a great thought provoking series.
Criminal Justice,"Wish I could upvote this x 1,000,000.00!! Loved this show!"
Criminal Justice,I got assigned to watch this show in my university forensic psychology course... seems absolutely fascinating
Criminal Justice,"As tough as it is to watch in the first episode or two, this is one of the best series of the year. Extraordinary acting, and Merritt Wever is phenomenal, as usual. An extraordinary cast, very believable dialog, and not gratuitous or melodramatic. Stays respectful to its subjects."
Criminal Justice,"Glad someone posted about this show. 

I just randomly stumbled upon after I logged into Netflix after couple of months or so, next thing I know I binged the whole thing in one sitting. 

I was surprised how I didn't come upon this as I regularly browse through r/television looking for recommendations."
Criminal Justice,justice system is broken. not enough resources.
Criminal Justice,Damn this thread is a dumpster fire.
Criminal Justice,"i love her! yes, her!"
Criminal Justice,Power dynamics. Like innocent until proven guilty
Criminal Justice,I just put this on my list.
Criminal Justice,This is the only show I binged on after When they see us.
Criminal Justice,Amazing show
Criminal Justice,"I like these kinda shows because of the emotions they drag outta me.I binged the whole show yesterday. I knew nothing of the story, so from episode 1, when you see her & foster mom talking with the cop, then detective, then nurse, then Connor, then back to the detectives questioning her story, I'm getting angrier and angrier bc she pretty much keeps telling them the same story, but they keep focusing on 1 small detail, which I understand as police they need to, but I can't stop being mad. 




You see how everyone around her fails her over and over and the frustrations and defeat she feels. I do believe her fosters do mean well and genuine care about Marie, but they do a piss poor job of comforting her. That's the sense I got from everyone aside from Grace & Judith, the detectives dealing with Marie, Lilly,the foster system, judicial system, they all believe they are trying to help the victim, but they don't. I can't speak highly of the amazing job Kaitlyn Dever did. She is having a great year, this show & the movie Booksmart are in my top 5 on the television and movie side, and she is a big part of why."
Criminal Justice,It's a good show. I watched all the episodes in 2 days. However I do think it was a little bit too on the nose at times when they were making some of their points.
Criminal Justice,"She was telling the truth, it‚Äôs based on a true story. You can search for the articles about it."
Criminal Justice,"This show is extremely good, but god damn, it was so hard to watch.  Just a massive indictment of how America treats vulnerable people across the board.

I also want to say how good the casting was for this.  Netflix originals have had a bad habit of casting really boring looking people, but everyone in this show just had so much character."
Criminal Justice,"I gave up on this show about 20 minutes in to the first episode, not because i thought it was bad, but because it made me uncomfortable as fuck. Is it worth to push through?"
Criminal Justice,"This show is ridiculously good.

Think it's on par with How They See Us ad arguably better.

Kaitlyn Dever is incredible in this. She plays the clueless, shattered and devastated teenager to perfection."
Criminal Justice,I cried in rage for an hour after watching this masterpiece. These people have a strength I will never have!
Criminal Justice,"I just watched this entire series in one sitting. Amazingly done. I was furious, I was sad, frustrated, disappointed, heartbroken, dumbfounded, but hopeful and relieved. Such a mix of emotions over how the original case was handled, how it got picked up again, and so on."
Criminal Justice,"This show will be taken as ""see how easy it is to accuse someone of rape?"" by 75% of its audience."
Criminal Justice,sounds like its a documentary about our judicial system.
Criminal Justice,Best netflix original show since...... ever
Criminal Justice,"I thought it was good, very sad, but also very very slow. I imagine that was done on purpose, to show how slow the process can be, but there were scenes that really just dragged on. 

On an unrelated note, it annoyed me how podunk they showed one of the towns a detective traveled to was.  Not realistic at all, which made me wonder how much more of the story they screwed up.  All in all it wasn‚Äôt even an important part, but I‚Äôm from that town and it pissed me off."
Criminal Justice,Lynnwood is a shit hole
Criminal Justice,After u watched this ... I immediately watched top boy....netflix had owned me for thr last two days
Criminal Justice,"The first episode or so was rough,  man. I can imagine how upsetting it would be to watch this as a victim of sexual assault because even for me it was extremely disturbing."
Criminal Justice,"Netflix said there won't be a 2nd season. I'm so disappointed about not having more episodes!

  


It's great show with strong female leads. I hope the producers can figure out a way to continue the series in some way.

  


To the women (heros) that were part of this investigation, I hope you are well and have rewarding lives."
Criminal Justice,"I would also love to see the flip side of this where it shows the stories of a rapist exploiting the system due to family, power and location. And where an innocent man falsely accused and the repercussions that can have on his mental healthy, reputation and freedom. It‚Äôs important that everyone understands how these situations can affect everyone involved."
Criminal Justice,"Really solid performing from the both lead actresses. Great series all in all, but the last episode was a bit too ""sweet"" for me. the show would have been perfect, ending on the episode before."
Criminal Justice,"belief really shouldn't enter into it

you can believe someone is telling the truth, but if there is no evidence other than a single person's recounting, that's not enough to charge anyone

it sounds like there actually was some physical evidence in her case that wasn't taken seriously, but the show made it a binary question of ""to believe or not to believe""."
Criminal Justice,Bad acting. Bad directing. Worst Netflix show I've ever watched/started watching.  Don't waste your time watching it
Criminal Justice,"Oh, like the Kavanaugh trials"
Criminal Justice,"Yeah, definitely skipping this one"
Criminal Justice,"The story that Unbelievable tells should be on Hallmark or Lifetime channel and glossed over by 90% of this subreddit.  However, the way Unbelievable tells the story, and the quality of the acting in this show is so fucking good that it deserves to be seen by a larger audience.  I actually challenge anyone who enjoyed True Detective Season 1 or Sinner Season 1 to please, please for your own sake, watch this show.  Even if you aren't too keen on a sad story, this shows so fucking soul crushing, and then rewarding that it deserves to be seen.  It also deserves to be renewed for season 2.  The first episode of Unbelievable sets the entire season up, and if you try to fastforward through it cause its uncomfortable...DON'T.  Every detail and emotion you experience in the opening episode of Unbelievable plays a key part in how you experience the final 2 episodes."
Criminal Justice,I can't watch this.  I don't know what stance the show takes but I've seen two separate false rape accusations on family and friends.  I have a very pessimistic look on this issue.
Criminal Justice,"I'm 4 episodes in and it's excellent, with the exception of Merritt Wever. One of the worst performances I've seen in years."
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,While I found the show compelling at times it ends kind shitty. Without any major spoilers they kind of made this seem like it was going to be a detective show but they actually find the person in a relatively simple way compared to other detective style shows. The first few episodes are really gripping and hard to watch but the show falls flat at the end and the last 2 episodes were pretty weak for a finale
Criminal Justice,And everyone clapped
Criminal Justice,"And it's also beyond ridiculous. Every white male is either the bad guy, incompetent or a Mary Sue. The only people who don't suck at their jobs are ""minorities""... it's just like Power all over againü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Eve from last man standing was great in it though."
Criminal Justice,Maybe i didn't fully pay attention but from the netflix description (years later it was found out ... Blabla) i figured the female officer was our victim at first. And by at first i mean i believed it for a very very long time. Guess i'm retarded.
Criminal Justice,"Here‚Äôs a little power dynamic for you- INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. The shows nothing more than. #metoo propaganda 

Go mike pence mode fellas. You ARE vulnerable to false accusations. Do not be alone at any time with women in the workplace"
Criminal Justice,Mrs Patches33 called it True Detective for women. Very good if still totally depressing.
Criminal Justice,"Oh good, more propaganda about how women should always be believed when they accuse somebody of rape."
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,"She lied, you can‚Äôt pin that on anybody but her."
Criminal Justice,"But, we live in a society of laws. truth is all we have. Sorry, but not sorry."
Criminal Justice,YAWN
Criminal Justice,Cancelled my Netflix subscription after its deal with Benioff and Weiss. It's stupid website doesn't work anyway.
Criminal Justice,[removed]
Criminal Justice,I‚Äôll never see this steaming pile of shit based on this short description
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,Thank all the false accusations. That‚Äôs why we are here! Ha101
Criminal Justice,"I listened to the This American Life episode about the story after watching  and I was struck by how personality disordered the real foster mom(s) seemed. One still invalidating and narcissistic, the other utterly histrionic and self-focused.

As a (mostly) child and adolescent therapist, I have heard so many clients describe parents (bio/step/foster/adoptive) like this"
Criminal Justice,And the shelter system. I work at the the non profit she was living at. The way the org handled it was a nightmare.
Criminal Justice,Seattle‚Äôs foster care system is incompetent.  This show highlights that it‚Äôs been broken for over 20 years.
Criminal Justice,Peek
Criminal Justice,[deleted]
Criminal Justice,"If Toni Collettes in it, you know it‚Äôs gonna be good."
Criminal Justice,That was a very interesting and infuriating read. I know Peggy feels bad and apologised but wow what a shitty thing to do! I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever forgive her if I was in that position. If I watch the series I‚Äôll probably end up throwing something at the tv.
Criminal Justice,"Reading through the article and getting to the part where she goes shopping for bedding--the same one the rapist stole--and her foster mom goes ""why do you want the same one?"" The thing that victims want most is to return to that sense of normalcy. The fact that people she trusted and liked to for support didn't believe her is heartbreaking and disappointing. I'm glad she was eventually able to feel safe and get some sort of closure."
Criminal Justice,">In a report not previously made public, Sgt. Gregg Rinta, a sex crimes supervisor with the Snohomish County Sheriff‚Äôs Office, wrote that what happened was ‚Äúnothing short of the victim being coerced into admitting that she lied about the rape.‚Äù

Not nearly as traumatic as what Marie went through, but I've experienced the same. I've been abused by more than one person. As a kid (maybe 11?) I tried to open up about the most minor of the incidents to adults. All I remember is parents and school officials standing around me and asking things like 'are you sure this happened' and 'if you move forward with this, people are going to in real big trouble' so of course I took it all back. And leaned to keep my mouth shut.

Lucky for the guy that was abusing me on the longest ongoing timeline, he was there to witness it all.

Edit: for some stupid reason I decided to start watching this show. It's even more representative of my experience than i thought. Bonus points for someone in the show making the case about it being the victims responsibility for going through the legal system to help other possible victims.

While it is a noble cause, it's just so much to ask of someone who's already been violated on the worst way. Of course police and your peers are going to be against you every step of the way. Personally, it's all I can do to not kill myself. Sorry I can't be a champion for other victims, but I don't want to hurt my own family. I'll stay alive to not spread my pain to them through suicide, but I am not strong enough for public backlash. I get that it's really selfish, but I just can't do it"
Criminal Justice,I watched it and it was very good. Throughout the series I felt like Marie was hit the hardest because everything sucked around her. She didn‚Äôt have a good support system. I was very relieved to find out that she didn‚Äôt lose her sanity despite everything.
Criminal Justice,"It was actually as infuriating as you imagined. I was about to act in a short film many years ago but my character was supposed to attempt rape as part of the movie. I couldn‚Äôt even do that. And my ex has been through that in real life. And the whole time watching this show, I was at the edge of my seat and saying out loud, ‚Äújust tell them!!‚Äù. 

Telling anyone wasn‚Äôt the issue obviously. =("

PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I'm old enough to remember when Succession was described as The Lannisters in the real world.

PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Wow. A truly original idea. Bravo, OP."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"You realize that's how the showrunners promoted the show before it even started airing?

[Here's a press release from 8 months ago](https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/house-of-the-dragon-will-be-succession-with-dragons-says-showrunner-game-of-thrones/)"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,SUCCESSION is just millenia-old palace intrigue set in the modern world
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I mean Succession is just Game of Thrones where Tywinn won because there weren't any dragons.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Power Rangers if just Big Bad Beetleborgs in different constumes.

PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I was ready to laugh in your face because I was expecting ""quality wise""

but Succession is Shakespeare with American CEOs instead of English kings, princes and vassals"

As someone said in the comments that there are just 10-12 stories since the beginning of time ... We just repeat them over and over .."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Yes. Succession with dragons as props
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Wow. No one ever said that before‚Ä¶

>‚ÄúI think Matt Smith is very funny. If there is one character that does not care, it is Daemon.‚Äù"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,[deleted]
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Really don't get the supposed lack of humour. This show has managed to crack me up once or twice every episode, whether it's Viserys wheezing over ludicrous propositions or Daemon/Aemond's grade A shit stirring at family meetings.

Please don't lower the standard to late-GoT cock jokes every 5 minutes."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"If season 2 is the war and humor season, I think season 3 may be the war crimes and no humor season.

PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"‚ÄúDragon showrunner Ryan Condal told The Times in London that producers deliberately slowed down the narrative for the first season, to ensure viewers were invested in the new characters. ‚Äú

Hmmm"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Honestly I fucking *loved* the first season of this show because I could see where they're taking it. The whole needing to understand all these characters so we can really feel the full weight of the tragedy is key. I hate when shows just jump right into the action, like, yes, it's more *exciting* in the short term but it has no real impact and ultimately just feels shallow. But in this show when these two factions go to war we will really feel it. You could already get a sense of this starting to happen over the last couple episodes, some very impactful moments got literal chills or a very real sense of dread because they set it up so fucking well, and we haven't even gotten to the really *big* stuff in the story yet. Can't wait for season 2.

Edit: oh, and for the humor, this season had the tone perfect."

I'll take ten hours of grim, gritty, horrifying war over having to hear any more comedy like that."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Why does everything need to be funny?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,and more camera rolling-ins on Olivia Cooke's feet!!!
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"It was way better than I expected, although my hopes were low.
Only thing that bugged me was how much they aged some female characters and obviously Viserys, while Cristen Cole, Daemon and Rhaenyras husband didn't get aged at all. How old is christen Cole now? 40,45?"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Don't add humor, if it doesn't fit the story, just because some idiots on the net are complaining about it. This is how GoT went down the drain, just pointless pandering. For fuck's sake."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I find the tense, Shakespearean dialogue scenes as compelling as any sword and board battle in the original series."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,And twice as many childbirth scenes! I swear half the runtime felt like women screaming into the microphone...
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"war and humorÔºümarvel, is that you?"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,How about some properly lit nighttime scenes? Just saw episode 7. Couldn‚Äôt see a damn thing from the sunset up until the kids brawl.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Can't wait for the Morbius cross over
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"In Ryan, I Trust!"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,more Olivia Cookes feet
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Who the fuck watches the first 8 episodes of HOTD or early seasons of GOT and thinks ""well, it's an alright show but the lack of humour is a problem""?"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Honestly, the forced humor played a major role in the deterioration of GOT‚Äôs quality towards the end. 

I much prefer character moments where I can‚Äôt help but laugh, but not because of a punchline, such as Matt Smith‚Äôs fantastic body language during the final dinner scene, when he stops the fighting with a single pointed finger, and has that phenomenal standoff with Aemond. They both are perfectly cast and even though there‚Äôs so much weight and subtext to that moment, with Aemond probably idolizing and yet recognizing Daemon as his enemy, while Daemon can‚Äôt help but recognize himself, and yet likewise realizes he‚Äôs a legitimate adversary. There‚Äôs so much going on in that brief exchange, and yet I laugh just because of how well the moment is handled."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,He needs to ignore the masters of complaints.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Ah yes, because nothing is more humorous than a lot of child murder and people being burned alive. Lul"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,They should have Daemon recreate the Wayne Brady sketch from Chappelle show.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,More war less humor
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I thought Daemon taking the head and leaving the tongue was funny. Larys and his fetish too.

Please dont force the humor, its dark times ahead."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Unbelievable first season, honestly I think I liked it more than GoT season 1. Really looking forward to the second season, war is coming!"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I‚Äôd just be happy with more lighting
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I haven‚Äôt become ‚Äòattached‚Äô to any of the characters in this show. Kill them all and start again for all i care. 

GOT had deeper characters by the second episode than this does in a whole season."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,This first season has been very boring
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,And Tits please.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I have to laugh at the fact that this was them taking it slowly and showing us the complexities of the characters, they've zoomed around 20 years and shown us jack shit regarding characters. Hell they are terrible at even presenting anything more complex out of their characters, considering that Rhaenys scene was supposed to be her finest hour, when she proves she should have been Queen. 

That aside which characters got more complex? Because honestly only Rhaenyra and Alicent seem to have gotten that, everyone else is quite clearly in the douche category or the barely defined category. The men especially have been made especially awful and lacking in complexity, Otto is a cunt without much of a plan, Aegon is sick in the head, Larys is an evil foot fetishist. 

And Daemon is written like he is bipolar, sometimes good to the people he likes, other times awful to everyone including them. Morally he is evil but as a character he flip flops so much between antagonist and supporting character it is nuts, and for some reason even behind the scenes they don't know what they want to do with him. In the episode with Vhagar dracarysing someone he gives 0 shits about his kids, but then on social media they show scenes cut from the show in which he hugs and consoles them. 

I also don't get some of the reactions here, y'all are fine with more murder for the sake of murder, but comedy would feel out of place? Because comedy works pretty well with tragedy, war and other bad things, it is a coping mechanism and gallows humor has been a thing for ages."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Humor? This isn‚Äôt a family comedy‚Ä¶. Or is it‚Ä¶.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Imo it‚Äôs been perfect. I can‚Äôt wait for the final. And hopefully s2 next year
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I don‚Äôt give a fuck about the humor. Keep giving us good writing and intricate political schemes and I‚Äôm all in. Hope he‚Äôs taken note of the viewer response to increased ‚Äúhumor‚Äù at the cost of good writing found in the second half of GoT.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,He says they deliberately slowed down the narrative.  I felt it moved along pretty fast considering they jumped forward an average of 3 years each episode.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Not going to lie, I'm kind of bored of it. In theory it has what a successful show should have, but it just doesn't have that spark that made game of thrones as good as it was. I like a good drama, but this one needs more spice. I'm not saying I hate it, but I'm not *excited* to watch it. No one is talking about it at lunch. I don't think about it after I've watched it. I don't really *care* about it at all. I don't think any of the characters are as interesting and the story definitely isn't as exciting. 

Oh well. Can't win them all."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,We don't need humour. It will ruin the show with stupid joke that we don't want.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,And characters that have actual character?  Any chance of that?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Humor is not exactly the missing ingredient here
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Wait but the long pauses and pointless drama is so entertaining.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,More T & A please
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Can we also have more Dragons?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Why are people so impatient? Season 1 of GoT wasn‚Äôt that quick paced and flashy. Throw in a bunch of war and you get Season 8. We all know how that went
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Personally I found it boring, I was hoping the dragon in the last episode would do something exciting"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Boring as hell
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"For the folks upset that that guy was black, now that the first season is done, did it affect the story at all?"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"thats good, my biggest beef with season 1 is that there werent nearly enough big laughs."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Can they improve the FUCK out of the CGI? the Rhaenys landing was just amateur as fuck
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,It‚Äôs been a great season. Excited to see how they build on it
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Just continue to deliver the level of detail and rational story building that is in season 1 plz. HoTD feels so much more grounded in the world of Westeros than any season of GoT.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I'm shocked I feel this way, but the show needs more humor. Everything is so fucking dour. Every conversation is about the succession. Everyone is full of dread or fear or anger or grief. It needs some levity to balance it all out and make the characters feel a bit more real or relatable.

GoT scenes like Ned and Arya laughing about Sansa's ""I don't want a brave strong man I want Joffery!"". Or Baelish and Varys talking elegant shit to each other. Or Arya showing up Bran during archery.

It makes each episode less heavy while also making what happens to these characters even more sad."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,We don‚Äôt need humor
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Fewer child birth scenes would also be great
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Good, because levity is the one thing this show is seriously lacking that GOT had. It is missed."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Please don't listen to the fans. Listening to the fans is what screwed up season 8 of GoT
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Oh no. People that are actually funny don't need to tell you that they are, or will be funny."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Seems like they're trying really hard to re create the original GoT vibe. I just don't think it's working.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Not gonna lie - it was a good season but a good ‚Äòmeh‚Äô season. By the time that season two comes out, I would‚Äôve forgot about it and have moved onto something else. Just doesn‚Äôt hit like GoT did."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Oh, great...can we get better pacing and dialogue, too? Also, using the hair and makeup team to show how the main characters are aging wouldn't hurt either. Maybe now that they don't have to spend so much time on Paddy they can throw some gray hair and wrinkles the others' way."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,The monetization of GOT ‚Ä¶.disappointing to say the least
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I still haven't watched a single episode.  Don't have the drive to.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Who the fuck wants more humor in this?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Love how the showrunners of ROP said the same thing. ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt like season 1, you‚Äôre going to love season 2.‚Äù That was immediately met with ‚Äúyeah right your show sucks‚Äù by Reddit. It‚Äôs funny how the same quote applied to another show gets a ‚Äúoh hell yeah thanks keep up the good work guys‚Äù response."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,This show has been terrible.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I wish for more nudity as well.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I mean, that shit was boring AF. The very last scene was promising, but damn if that show didn't put me to sleep. Also it was so dark, you could only watch it at night or you literally couldn't see shit. WTH?"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"What I honestly did not enjoy in House of Dragon was:

* The change of actors due to time stretch needings;
* The time skips themselves;
* The fact that there isn't much variety in terms of characters and locations like in GoT, where characters spread and follow their own path and it possibly intertwines with other characters' somewhere down the road, making things interesting.

Shame, cause I expected a better delivery from Martin now that he's acting 100% as director."
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Maybe se 2 can add a visual cue before Matt Smith speaks so I can turn the volume up in time to hear him?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"Humour?

Welp, it was good while it lasted"
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Drink every time someone says ‚Äúshowrunner‚Äù
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,So a James Corden casting when ?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Doesn‚Äôt season 2 come out in 2024 though?
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,How about turning up the lights so we can actually see what's going on on screen. Jfc this show is dark
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Better pacing would be most welcome
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,Fire the writers and I will consider watching season 2
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,‚ÄúWe promise to make season 2 so fucking dark you won‚Äôt be able to see your own nose.‚Äù
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,I think they needed more action and the finale should have been AT LEAST a hour and a half. They fluffed most of the last 2 episodes. It was a bit underwhelming. And they knew we would have to wait 2 years and they gave us less than an hour. I wanted at least a sword fight or a small battle between divided lands like damm.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,No thanks.
PILI Fantasy: War of Dragons,"I hope the war will be better because S1 wasn't interesting at all and boring. Maybe the finale tonight will spice the story but for now, s2 is not on my plan.."

* Pedro Pascal is one of the few actors I'd watch eating mashed potatoes.
* Trailer looks awesome.
* I loved The Walking Dead and World War Z. I welcome another Zombie dystopia... or at least this is what I think it is (don't spoil it if it isn't)
* I Trust HBO... this is what good programing do to a brand."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I‚Äôve never gotten around to playing it but it‚Äôs my wife‚Äôs favorite game. I‚Äôve been looking forward to experiencing it without the game as a reference.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I‚Äôve only heard of the game through ads but know nothing of the game. Excited for the show though.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I didn‚Äôt know about the video game till I saw previews and I was told it was based on video game. 

I am exited for the show because of cast and because it is set in apocalyptic world ( is it??? I am not 100 percent sure, but I liked previews)"
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I've heard of it. Never played it. Never will. Not a gamer.

But I'm excited for the show, as I'm a fan of Pascal and Craig Mazin."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I had never heard of the game and I am mildly interested in the show.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"My parents don't play video games. They have never heard of The Last of Us. They saw a trailer for the show before an episode of House of the Dragon. My mom asked me if I'd heard of it, saying it looked cool and they might watch it. Which was funny to me because it's my favorite video game."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Giving how popular games are nowadays, specially Playstation big IPs, I think it's very unlikely people who already know about the show never heard about the game before.

That being said, since I like TLoU more for the story and characters rather than gameplay, I think it could indeed make a pretty good show. Specially on HBOs hands."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I am. I am not into video games at all, unless they're of the Tetris variety, but I love post-apocalyptic stories, so I am looking forward to trying this show out."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I know of the game and some of the basic plot but I've never played it, probably never will since I'm not big into story based games.

I'm excited mostly for Craig Mazin"
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I‚Äôve never played but I know the entire plot line of the game as well as the prequel and sequel. It should do pretty well
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I've heard of it, but never played it. By what I know, it sounds like it would be good TV material."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Heard of the game, just never got around to playing it. I‚Äôll probably play it after season 1 ends. Honestly just excited for the show because it sounds like it‚Äôs going to be really well done, and it‚Äôs on HBO which I trust to handle the story."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Have anyone seen the movie 'The girl with all the gifts'?

It's the closest I've seen to a Last of Us movie."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I've actually played it but gave up a few hours in and sold my copy of the game...  which I never did.

It was a real love-hate relationship.  I fell in love with every cutscene and grew to hate the game when it came to its gameplay...  Eventually, the hate won out, and I moved to other games.

I am very interested in the show.  Will likely pick up HBO Max at some point to watch it."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I‚Äôve played both games and can‚Äôt wait to see people reactions. I don‚Äôt play many games but that series is easily one of the best I‚Äôve ever played
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Heard of the game, will never play it, and likely won‚Äôt watch the show. I haven‚Äôt heard any excitement about the show really."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,No interest in video games and I wouldn't say I'm *excited* but I am curious.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I'm expecting prestige Resident Evil. If that's what it is, I'm here for it."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Also the voice/mo cap actors for Joel and Ellie make a cameo in the series. Troy Baker as a henchman, Ashley Johnson as a woman trying in the trailer after (assuming) giving birth."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,Never played it
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I've always wanted Cormac McCarthy's The Road to be made into a TV series. This TLoU adaptation is the closest I'll probably get to have that wish come true.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I haven't played it since no playstation, but I look forward to watching it / playing it when ported to pc."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I never played the game though I am a video gamer. Not really excited but expect it will be good and will watch it when it comes out.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Not a gamer at all (the last Naughty Dog game I ever played because my sister was into it was Crash Bandicoot :-).   But if Craig Mazin's showrunning it, I'm in. I've been listening to [Scriptnotes](https://johnaugust.com/scriptnotes) ever since *Chernobyl...*"
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I have never played the video game, haven‚Äôt played video games since high school (I‚Äôd barely even heard of the last of us), and honestly my natural reaction to hearing about this show was to roll my eyes because I‚Äôm not interested in nerd culture and was annoyed that super talented people‚Äôs efforts were being spent on a video game TV show. 

Id say I‚Äôm much more interesting in watching it than I‚Äôm excited about it. I really like a lot of the people involved and HBO seems to be really getting behind it and they rarely seem to miss when they back something so I‚Äôm trusting them to make something I‚Äôll like or at the very least appreciate but may not be for me."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I‚Äôve heard of The Last of Us, and I‚Äôve intentionally avoided it because of that.  But, I‚Äôm pretty sure the TV version is going to suck me in."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,You‚Äôll definitely love it
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,It is.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,[removed]
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I have never played the game but have heard how amazing it is and I am thoroughly excited for the TV show. I‚Äôm hoping this can be the first show that does a game justice.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I havent seen it but just looked it up. Sounds interesting altho eerily similar in scope regarding TLOU virus.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Ahhh, no kidding? I didn't know anything about the game other than what I've read about in stuff about the show. But I really liked The Girl With All the Gifts so now I'm looking forward to this one."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,That‚Äôs an excellent movie.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I've played the game many times and have also compared it to the road, but after awhile I decided to overall tone and world is more similar to children of men"
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I get where you‚Äôre coming from. But imo, besides for being a video game, there is nothing nerdy about it. My fianc√©e doesn‚Äôt like video games but regularly requested to watch me play TLoU because she was so invested in the story."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,I am curious if your opinion changed on the show now that season 1 has finished
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,It's basically if Ellie was taken in by the Firefly instead of Joel.  Even the virus & zombies are similar to the game.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"i really enjoyed it! haven't seen the finale yet, but its been a fun ride! Not a contender for the all time great tv show conversation by any means, but clearly incredibly well made and acted. Its really important to have ""very good"" shows, not everything has to be historically great to be a success. 

that said, Pedro + Bella is a elite combo"

How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Taxi, Cheers, MASH, Murphy Brown, Alice, Welcome Back Kotter, Night Court.

The workplace sitcom has been a staple for decades."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"There is just far far less community now and sitcoms tend to reflect situations that are relatable to people. 

The sad fact is since the 80s the copper wire has been stripped out of the walls with regular people having to do more to keep the dysfunctional economy going. More people will be able to relate to workplace situations than having a group of friends at this point.

Hell look at the front page of reddit where there normally is a thread on how to make friends as an adult. We're just a desocialised society"
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"The dominant sitcom up to about five years ago was The Big Bang Theory, which was a Friends knockoff. There was also How I Met Your Mother, which copied a lot from Friends. The dominant single camera show was Modern Family, which was certainly on the ""hanging  out"" tree. And then there's Curb, where all Larry does is wander around."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Interesting that you mentioned Brooklyn 99 since it always felt like an updated version of Barney Miller to me. I think its more of a cyclical thing. The work place sitcom is not a new thing, there's been things like Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, Mash, Sports Night, News Radio, Taxi, Night Court, Murphy Brown etc there may be more of a concentration of them now. I have to admit i don't really keep up with modern comedies so i can't say for sure"
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,Not even entirely joking here: people have less friends today. Most of their relationships outside of family now are workplace related.
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"There are broadly three types of sitcom. Family, friends and workplace. Every few years one those types gets into fashion usually pushed by a big hit."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"No I think the opposite is true.  Before Seinfeld, I can't think of any sitcom that was just friends hanging out.  As far as popular older shows like that, just that and Friends and the Friends clones like Caroline in the City, Two Guys and a Girl etc.  Pretty much every old sitcom was work or family based."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,bc all we do is work nowadays (when not busy side hustling)
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"Grand Crew is a sitcom about a group of friends.  Very much Friends except none of the Friends are white and they hang out in a wine bar instead of a coffee shop.  It's really good.

Ghosts is about a group of friends, they're just mostly dead."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,This thread is you bring outed by your selective viewing choices
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,How do you count cheers?
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I don't know, but sitcoms moved from ""just hanging"" to a more aggressive approach to comedy in the mid to late '90s - Seinfeld, Frasier, Friends. Shows naturally sped up as they went along even if they only briefly touched this period -- like Cheers. Arrested Development was one of the first to truly capitalise on this by moving at a quick clip, jam-packed with self-referential stuff. I far preferred the lazier early seasons of sitcoms pre-mid/late '90s."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"""Sitcoms about friends hanging out"" died in the 2010s because any show like that other than New Girl wasn't able to rake in multiple millions of viewers consistently. Pretty much all the big 
ones that premiered after New Girl failed. So Hollywood got scared out of making them. They'll come back eventually."

How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"I'd also argue it's the exact opposite. It's so much easier to meet people now than anytime in the past. Before you had people you went to school with, people you lived next to you, friends of the family, or colleagues. You had to be close to get to know people and keep in contact. Now people can have much more diverse friend groups through hobbies, by meeting online, have long distance friendships through texting or FaceTiming. Its easier to have a lot more acquaintances and keep in casual contact through social media than a handful of constant companions. You can fade in and out of people's lives and still keep track of them without spending all that time face to face. And if you don't like them, there are always hundreds, thousands, millions more people at your digital fingertips ready to meet and socialize with... like here on reddit, discord, etc. Before people kept hanging out with crappy friends that caused conflict because getting new ones was hard, and a shared history was enough to hold the group together. Now people have more discerning standards and a workplace is a much more convenient place to have chaos through forced proximity, which suits a sitcom situation. 

So many comedies back in the day were about toxic families that stayed together..... because??? That's just what they did, even when they were miserable. That was the whole joke of the show. Nowadays that dynamic would be considered borderline emotional and verbal abuse. Same with a lot of the shows with friend groups. They're practically bullies who constantly insult and undermine each other, or act as sponges who use each other.

In a workplace you're under no obligation to like each other and can have zero in common with those around you. Dynamics that wouldn't be tolerated in most friend groups. But because the characters work together they're forced to bear it and at least act polite, hence creating the situation for comedy."
How Many Kilograms are the Dumbbells You Lift?,"It's got to be cyclical.  How many places have you got a group of people who are routinely together?  Work, family or friends.  And if they are friends, it's a little easier if some of them are roommates.

*Seinfeld* stands out because it's a friends show, without them being roommates."

But I've amassed friends in dozens of countries with relationships the have lasted more than a decade because we could keep in touch online. People that I met for a week when travelling have become lifelong friends because I can keep up to date with them, see photos of their lives, chat or message them multiple times a week on social media. Before that a couple random long distance calls or post cards would have never been possible to keep up that kind of connection. Through the pandemic I made more friends than ever on random discord servers for various creators and hobbies. I saw people fall in love and move across the country to be with the partners they met there, who they spent months talking to each other daily, or sharing late night watch parties, posting pics of their meals, sharing stories of their hardship, venting about work etc. I built connections with people who shared my interests and random obsessions. People that I never would have met before. Or never could have kept in contact with had we been relying on old school telephone calls or letters. These are all friends I could message day or night and who would be there for me whenever I needed. We've had multiple meetups irl, in multiple countries. Getting together to go to events or just so we could all hang out for real. 

People who feel a lack of connection 'because of the internet' were never going to put in the work to get to know or care about other people. They would only hang around people who were convenient and in close proximity. Which is exactly what I said in my last post. The internet is full of opportunities, but not everyone wants to take advantage of them. And that's their loss."

Fleming also died such a tragic death, a wild story in its own right. 

>Fleming signed to star in High Jungle, a two-part episode of the short-lived Off to See the Wizard, also intended for theatrical distribution in Europe. Six weeks into the location shoot in Peru, Fleming and co-star Nico Minardos were in a dugout canoe that overturned in the Huallaga River. Minardos managed to swim to safety.

As far as comedies go I am always rewatching Absolutely Fabulous, Strangers with Candy, Home Movies, and Reno 911"
Dr. Stone,There's always something special about toonami promos
Dr. Stone,"Wow, the dub actually sounds really good."
Dr. Stone,Might have to watch season 1
Dr. Stone,This would have impressed the hell out of 11-year old me.
Dr. Stone,"I watched the first season with the dub, it‚Äôs definitely high quality"
Dr. Stone,I‚Äôve noticed a lot of dubs increase in quality. Probs because anime is becoming more and more popular
Dr. Stone,The notion that dubs are bad is antiquated af. Dubbing has gotten really good over the past decade.
Dr. Stone,because the dub is dooooope
Dr. Stone,"Season 1 was really good. The little side bits they had were very entertaining too, like the segment on how to make your own Cola or ramen."
Dr. Stone,24 year old me still very impressed and pleased
Dr. Stone,Its a fun show. Makes you rethink how far we have come with science even through a lot of times it is a little bit of a stretch what they do in the show but let that not take the fun away from you.
Dr. Stone,"I love this series so much. It's just a fun show all around, and the manga is probably my favorite ongoing series at the moment."
Dr. Stone,"Episodes 7-16 will be shown this December 28, 2019: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2299245577032943&id=1440408039583372"
Dr. Stone,I already watched the first season on Crunchyroll. Every episode was great. I just wish there were more.
Dr. Stone,"The over the top facial expressions and extremely goofy characters ruined it for me

Doesn't help that it's filled with pseudo science"
Dr. Stone,"Yeah, there's certainly a bit too much ""try not to think about it, I guess"" for a show that ambitious about being smart in it for my liking, but it's still a very enjoyable watch."
Dr. Stone,Beyond the science directly pertaining to the petrification what pseudoscience is there?
Dr. Stone,You mean a really strong dude shouldn t be able to take on a pack of lions unarmed?
Dr. Stone,"He made glasses by shaving a single piece of glass,concentrated nitric acid isn't formed from just bat piss,seashells aren't the best material to create gunpowder"
Dr. Stone,They could have fixed that scene by making them wolves not lions. To me that would have been way more believable.
Dr. Stone,"Didn't make it through the whole video but I did enjoy and agree with what was said for the most part.

Dr. Stone is a really solid show. I'm an unashamed shonen guy and it is quite different to traditional shonen mainstays but I think it helps it stand out. I like that Senku just is who he is. He isn't exactly heroic, just sort of conniving and manipulative but also not in an evil way he's just trying to get shit done.

I know anime isn't very popular around here but I think it's worth a try. 

Also, I don't have kids but I feel like this show would be great for kids. It puts a great emphasis on science and the importance of intellect and really makes science out to be this wondrous thing. I'm an adult and I feel like its given me a greater appreciation for (and interest in) science."
Dr. Stone,What‚Äôs with all the downvotes?. This is a tv show.
Dr. Stone,"I was disappointing with Dr. Stone, but it was kinda my fault going in almost blind. I expected a mystery/thriller based of the premise, but it feels more like a comedy with some bits of drama. Not bad, but not my cup of tea."
Dr. Stone,People are not a huge fan of anime in general here.
Dr. Stone,The people on this sub will only upvote normie shit like Attack on Titan

Dr. Stone,"Not really trying to spoil stuff, but pretty much everyone gets frozen in stone and he is by himself and after agonizing over stuff for a while he realizes he can save the world through science. So he puts that on his shirt as a kind of ‚ÄúI can fucking do this with science‚Äù type of thing. So it‚Äôs more of a motivator."
Dr. Stone,Basically is u have a talent like ur smart or dumb or strong or are sexy u wake up from being frozen in stone. The main charter is %100 an asshole but wants to fix the earth. The dumb guy is the muscle but hes a pussy in battle and the strong guy is basically super human nazi right away. And the chick has tits. That's the first  6 eps
Dr. Stone,Love how you added attack on titan in there hahah
Dr. Stone,"""I've been blinded by my mother's toxic love!"""
Dr. Stone,I would recommend Legion and DEVS for the visual aesthetics and world building as well.
Dr. Stone,Justin Theroux is hilarious in this.
Dr. Stone,"Always happy to see Maniac get mentioned.

I don't have too many all-time favorite shows. Breaking Bad/BCS, Game of Thrones (at least in its prime), Mr Robot, Dark, The Leftovers, The OA, and maybe even Utopia (UK).

Maniac is also one of them. Something about it... dense quality packed in to almost every aspect. It's fun, it's got some depth, and it's visually stunning. For a miniseries, I think it's perfect (which is different from flawless, as I don't think any story can be flawless, especially considering that many flaws are subjective. For me, a story can be perfect as long as it hits enough notes higher than most stories do)."
Dr. Stone,"I absolutely loved it as well, it's one of my favourite shows.  
   
But the storytelling is very unique and I can definitely understand how it is not for everyone. It has an almost Twin Peaks level of weirdness. Visually, it is pretty much flawless."
Dr. Stone,I wanted to like this so much more than I did. And I liked it. I just didn‚Äôt love it. But it certainly had moments of brilliance.
Dr. Stone,That show is really fucking good.
Dr. Stone,I particularly appreciated the way they represented schizophrenia
Dr. Stone,Annie I'm a hawk
Dr. Stone,The lemur episode is one of my favorite pieces of tv ever!
Dr. Stone,"I feel like this show disappeared from the collective conscience very quickly, maybe because it was too off the wall. But I'm glad you reminded us to que it up for a rewatch."
Dr. Stone,It‚Äôs the best thing Netflix has produced.
Dr. Stone,"I didn‚Äôt like it at all. So much time is spent on the meta plots they go through after taking the pills that it became tediously pointless. 

Like, when they‚Äôre doing a murder mystery party or when they‚Äôre in the 80‚Äôs trying to steal an iguana, etc, all of that felt so tediously irrelevant and pointless that it made me not enjoy the show. The characters aren‚Äôt aware of who they are in the real world, so it felt like the plot and characters weren‚Äôt progressing for long periods of time. 

Just didn‚Äôt work for me. Justin Theroux was the best part though and I loved the first episode."
Dr. Stone,"Check out station eleven when it comes out on Thursday, same show runner."
Dr. Stone,"It's been a while since I have watched this show but I agree,it's a really good minisseries with a beautiful message."
Dr. Stone,It was pretty good.
Dr. Stone,Maniac is awesome!
Dr. Stone,I'm still using that wake up ringtone after all these years! Great series!
Dr. Stone,I really need to get a poster of this show.
Dr. Stone,Loved Maniac. This post might inspire me to do a rewatch. The music has stuck with me through all the years.
Dr. Stone,I watched it and thought it'd have a good payoff in the end but it was just zany and off-putting. Wasn't my cup of tea.
Dr. Stone,"Really well written and yes, the world building was beautiful. Emma Stone knocked it out of the park and Justin Theroux was hilarious.

I thought Jonah Hill struggled a bit with the acting scenes. He‚Äôs not a great actor and he has kind of a turkey neck in this (not his fault but it distracted me). 

Everyone else really out-acted him and I felt sorry for him. Especially when he puts on a fake accent, it was too cringey for me."
Dr. Stone,Seemed like a ripoff of Legion
Dr. Stone,My GF started watching it and likes it a lot. I will give it a go.
Dr. Stone,"I watched it, but I barely remember anything about it"
Dr. Stone,"What's wrong with the world isn't that I'm sick....

It's that I don't matter."
Dr. Stone,"It was a really good show.  Jonah Hill surprised me, because he was mostly annoying in everything else he‚Äôd been in.


I wish we‚Äôd get more"
Dr. Stone,"Exceptional show, really liked it. Justin Theroux kills it, i watch everything he stars in since his performance in The Leftovers. Criminally underrated actor."
Dr. Stone,Cheers for the heads up - a comedys with Jonah Hill rated 7.7 that Ive never heard of?  FUCK yeh - thats higher than Superbad!!
Dr. Stone,Devs is brilliant and on par with Maniac in quality even though they‚Äôre very different thematically. Great rec.
Dr. Stone,I really loved the first season of legion. Need to go back and finish the series
Dr. Stone,I thought Legion supposedly jumped the shark or something? I haven't watched it tho
Dr. Stone,"While this is obviously subjective, if something is comparable to Legion, I'm instantly & completely turned off and most likely won't give it a chance. 

Legion is basically the definition of style over substance. What a waste of time that show was."
Dr. Stone,"I know this sub can get kinda annoying with all the Patriot-praise, but based on the shows that you mentioned I feel like you would probably love it."
Dr. Stone,a couple others I would add are Halt & Catch Fire + You're the Worst
Dr. Stone,I don‚Äôt have the same list but it‚Äôs a good list
Dr. Stone,"Patrician taste, i think Mr. Robot does not get enough praise, especially the last season was  absolute top-tier. Leftovers is one-in-a-million, too, next to Six Feet Under the most human show i've ever watched, extremly talented cast as well."
Dr. Stone,"Excellent list, I would say a few strong 10/10 you got there."
Dr. Stone,"Oh wow, I adore *BB/BCS*, good *GoT*, *Mr Robot*, *Utopia UK* & *The Leftovers*. 

Guess I need to give *The OA* and *Dark* (and *Maniac*) a shot!"
Dr. Stone,"Another Neflix show which I think fits in this general genre of shows is Russian Doll.  It's a show you really, really have to let get going.  You think it's going to be a very specific type of season for the first three episodes, but then it really takes things in a new and pretty great direction."
Dr. Stone,Found this while I was searching Maniac. We have very similar favorite shows. Definitely check out Severance ASAP if you haven't had a chance.
Dr. Stone,5 6 7 8
Dr. Stone,"I prefer Dark between the two of them, but love both."
Dr. Stone,"> it felt like the plot and characters weren‚Äôt progressing for long periods of time.  

I get how you can say that about the plot, because plot plays a very minor part in the show. It's all about the characters and their growth.  
   
I don't understand how you can say that Maniac lacks progress in terms of the characters if you actually watched the show. It's the whole point of it."
Dr. Stone,"I get what you're saying, but to me this show isn't good because of its plot, but everything else. The meta characters are elements of the psyches of the real world characters. Like for example the mafia plotline is about how Owen feels about his real life family."
Dr. Stone,Take shrooms. Then you'll get it.
Dr. Stone,"It's not the same kind of comedy as superbad, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!"
Dr. Stone,"It's far from the only example, but it's one of those shows that makes you think ""damn, Jonah Hill can really act."""
Dr. Stone,Mizuno is so wooden and dull in Devs. Shame as I liked the rest of it.
Dr. Stone,"I wouldn‚Äôt say it jumped the shark at all, there‚Äôs something that happens that not a lot of fans were fond of, but it‚Äôs still an incredible series. I‚Äôd also say it‚Äôs one of the best pieces of cinematography ever. I‚Äôd always recommend it to anyone interested."
Dr. Stone,"Season 1 was pretty good, season 2 was a 2-pack of hot ass, and i can‚Äôt speak on season 3 as i never bothered to watch it on account of how awful season 2 was."
Dr. Stone,"1st season was great, 3rd season was good, 2nd season was pretty bad imo."
Dr. Stone,Legion was great!
Dr. Stone,"Thanks a ton for the recommendation! I actually haven't caught much wind of Patriot yet, not enough to know if it'd be worth it for me to check it out. (I don't frequent this sub much these days, nor keep up with other TV news--I like to be as blind as possible when I go into a story, so I generally avoid such information hubs).

But, my best recommendations typically come from people who know the peak of my taste and give me content that hits similar lines. So, I'm looking forward to checking it out now!"
Dr. Stone,"This is what I came here to say. I thought they might have the same creator (they don't), but Patriot is one of my all-time favorites. The vibe is very similar to Maniac."
Dr. Stone,"I'm not sure You're the Worst really matches the tone of any of your favorites.  Having said that, it's a fantastic show.  If you read a synopsis of it, it will look like a horrible cliched cynical rom-com.  But pretty much every time you think ""of course, here's what happens next,"" it zigs a different direction in an immensely satisfying way.  Aya Cash (Stormfront from The Boys) is goddamned amazing in it."
Dr. Stone,"Based on my favorites, or in general? If the former, I'll definitely add these to my watchlist!"
Dr. Stone,"Always hear rave reviews of SFU, and still haven't checked it out yet! I need to get around to that one, thanks for the reminder!"
Dr. Stone,"Good luck on our taste coinciding more!

I got the recommendation for The Leftovers from The OA fans. I asked them, ""I need something else remotely like this,"" and that was one of the top recs they gave me. It's at least as divisive as The Leftovers, so try to go in as open minded as you can. The first season started as an 8 for me then slowly hit a 9. It didn't become a 10 for me until S2, especially by the finale which sealed the deal in the best way possible. I will also say that many people disliked S1 but loved S2 (and some vice versa), so if you fall off board, but not completely, then keep going as far as you can.

For Dark, you may not need this advice, but to be safe I'll toss it out. 1) ensure you watch subbed. The dub isn't remotely as good, and it makes a huge difference. 2) don't watch in the background. It needs full attention. 3) try to go in blind--if you can get away without knowing a single thing, even trivial, all the better.

For Maniac, yeah, just buckle in and enjoy the ride. What it does, it does very well."
Dr. Stone,"Oops, late reply! Russian Doll has been near the upper echelon of my watchlist since it came out! I don't know anything about it other than knowing that the vibe I get from people talking about it is a vibe that I think I would *greatly* dig.

Thanks for the reminder! It's about time to hike it up a bit higher in my watchlist."
Chhota Bheem,"Because kids nowadays aren't attracted to what we grew up with,they find it boring.I know this as a fact,when I had to watch my nephew for a couple of hours,and changed the channel to YT,with old Courage the cowardly dog clips,he got bored and told me to switch back to whatever crap Nickelodeon had on at that time.

It's just the times changing...20-25 years ago was the first time I saw a phone,a ericsson with a 1-2 centimeters wide,and 5 centimeters long screen.Nowadays I see kids that have phones 10 times more expensive than mine,and scrolling thru FB or Tiktok like a basic human function..."
Chhota Bheem,"The answer is always the same when people ask why a TV channel became what it is. Why did kid's channels change? Why doesn't MTV play music? Why did History channel become so invested in aliens? Why isn't TLC The Learning Channel anymore? It's money and viewers. They're chasing what's gonna give them the most viewers, they programming what will get them viewers now not what might get them viewer based on nostalgia. And they're doing that on the tightest budget they can."
Chhota Bheem,"Kids like vibrant, loud and fast cartoons. Kids channels today don‚Äôt have to just compete with other kids channels anymore, they have to compete with YouTube, TikTok, Roblox, etc. Our cartoons are too dark, grainy, and slow to hold up."

Family Reunion,"I'm Indian and it was funny. It was mostly humour about East Asians, it wasn't negative against Indians."
Family Reunion,"This opinion isn't uncommon in Chinese and Chinese diaspora communities throughout East/Southeast Asia. In Malaysia, where Chiang is from, Indians are the next largest ethnic minority group after Chinese, but don't hold nearly the economic power that the Chinese community does, though there's definitely an Indian elite/professional class. Usually this comes with a dollop of Han-centricism (the only cultures which matter are touched culturally or politically by the various dynasties of the Middle Kingdom [minus the non-Han ones, save when they Hanified]). 

Not excusing it, just saying that it's consistent with where he's from, as well as really disappointing if that's an indication of his beliefs rather than something put on for a joke."

Family Reunion,Who‚Äôs Cartwright?
Family Reunion,The little old basket case on wheels or the ten foot tall roadblock?
Family Reunion,Call the President.
Family Reunion,Crazier: He has acting credits for every year since he began working.
Family Reunion,And he‚Äôs absolutely beloved.
Family Reunion,"Right, but, let‚Äôs say I haven‚Äôt seen it. What is it?"
Family Reunion,Badlands but I think the series got worse after season 1 or 2

Family Reunion,He had some small parts recently in the last season of Westworld..not saying to watch it all but just pointing out where I  saw him
Family Reunion,"The general populace in China is called [""100 family names"" for a reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baixing)."
Family Reunion,"Even if it's consistent with where he's from, that doesn't mean it's not closed to being criticized. People can have a lot of closeminded views back where they're from, but that doesn't mean it should be acceptable here.

You brought more context to the issue so thank you for that."
Family Reunion,Every time we hear his voice or see him in something my gf and I do the DiCaprio pointing meme lol it‚Äôs crazy how prolific of an actor he is
Family Reunion,The man only has 451 acting credits on IMDb. /s
Family Reunion,not familiar

Family Reunion,"I watched Turning Red last week and was reminded how great of a voice actor he is as well. He's great in Kung Fu Panda and Mulan of course, but apparently he has uncredited voice work in the first american dub of the original Godzilla! What a career!"
Family Reunion,"The movie will answer your question, I‚Äôm not going to spoil it. Just go watch it, it amazing"
Family Reunion,"Obviously spoilers for EEAAO:

Family Reunion,"There's only 3 seasons. I really liked it despite its faults. The first main bad's storyline finished at the end of s2 instead of dragging on, the most annoying character in the show got offed at the end of s3, Nick Frost joined the cast and did a lot of big guy Sammo Hung esque Kung Fu and they were gearing up to introduce gun fu it seemed in S4 before it got cancelled.

I'm also really into that ruins of the old world vibe like in Fallout, and Horizon."
Family Reunion,"I don't think Badlands was ever good, the first episode was just almost good to me. I think it was just slightly too far past the silly line."

Family Reunion,Thank you!!

Family Reunion,worth watching just for the fight choreography. Absolutely incredible
Family Reunion,"It was a fun but dumb show. Cheesy over the top wire-fu action, like Xena Warrior Princess or Hercules. Maybe it wasn't ""good"" but I still enjoyed it for what it was."
Family Reunion,I KNOW I‚ÄôM NOT CARTWRIGHT!!!
Family Reunion,"Good luck. It‚Äôs no walk in the park. As you well know, Jack Burton spends the majority of the movie a few steps behind whatever is happening."
Family Reunion,"They seemed fine with it, I think not answering their question and saying ""it amazing"" is a worse answer"
Family Reunion,"The over the top wuxia style fight scenes were so fun to watch. The costume design also stood out to me, everyone is just so snappily dressed (shout out to whoever did Emily Beecham's wardrobe).

Unfortunately the story's pace wasn't great and the acting ranged from just okay (where the actors own the cheesiness and just chew scenery) to kind of bad (looking at you MK)."

Fire Force,"The Kyoto animation incident is a tragedy, but the show is called FIRE Force. This always seems silly to me when tv companies do this . If they wanted to take another week or two off and air it unaltered I‚Äôd gladly wait for it. Why would you change your show? You can‚Äôt take back all the other fire related media that‚Äôs out there."
Fire Force,"I get it.  The show *24* was altered on one of its episodes due to 9/11.  

However, the timing is not in *Fire Force*'s favor.  I would take another week off, though, just so that there isn't too much altering of the show."
Fire Force,"honestly this has to be the worst possible time to be premeiring your anime series called fire force.

they literally fight fire with fire in the show."
Fire Force,"Well it could be worse. I remember when 9/11 happened, some shows got shelved entirely."
Fire Force,"No surprise there.   Only a few episodes have aired, but it has outstanding animation, great soundtrack, and is made by the same creator as Soul Eater.    It could garner a big following in the west"
Fire Force,i love this show so much you guys!!!! i cried at both episodes so far
Fire Force,So many people say You is a guilty pleasure.  Personally I don't feel an ounce of guilt for really enjoying this show.  Just finished season 4 tonight and loved it.  Joe is pure plot armor but honestly I really just don't fucking care.  Stab away Joe.  I'm with you till the end buddy.
Fire Force,Joe is the the textbook definition of plot armor. There must be no good lawyers in the you-verse if he‚Äôs able to successfully frame so many people
Fire Force,First time?
Fire Force,did you not pay attention to the part where Joe said he wanted Marianne to be found. so her daughter would have closure?
Fire Force,"The writers don't understand Joe's character but you do. 
It's always been you.
You're the only one who understands Joe."
Fire Force,"I think this is You's worst season. The whole murder-mystery vibe of the first 5 eps was just okay, but none of those formed into a cohesive ending as the ""killer"" just ""revealed himself by the end of ep 5. None of Joe's investigating has come to a cohesive thought.

With the benefit of hindsight, of course this isn't what really happens (talking about who the killer really is, ep 6 above). But all of the runtime investigating who the eat-the-rich killer was wasted and almost the entire 5 eps felt like they were almost all for nothing. 

Aside from that, the first 5 eps had a weird vibe. I think the writers wanted to change things up, but the generic murder-mystery vibe of the first half made You lose it's identity. It was never like that for the past 3 years.

The 2nd half felt worse. It's almost 5 eps of joe just fighting his inner demon (you-know-who), and the plot just felt like it was pondering up until the 10th ep. I absolutely loved the last half of ep 10 though. The plot twist has been a number of times so it wasn't really a shocker or a game-changer, and it really slowed the pacing down."
Fire Force,"I dropped this show after they decided to kill Love and just start the cycle all over again. It was a nice guilty pleasure, but I‚Äôm done. The best part of S3 was the brief moments where Joe and Love worked together.

Did they bring Mariane back? Such a dull character when compared to his previous love interests. I couldn‚Äôt stand his infatuation with her in S3. I was like, ffs, just focus on Joe and Love."
Fire Force,"Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn‚Äôt want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe ‚Äúdies‚Äù in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just *needs* to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù allows ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he‚Äôs always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous.

As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe."
Fire Force,"I think you're applying too much real world logic to the show. It's a silly murder comedy drama, not a documentary."
Fire Force,I this season 4 was the best season. It was dumb mindless drama. Yeah lot of plot of armor but it‚Äôs popcorn tv just set back and enjoy it.
Fire Force,Also would he not watch the news to see if they found her body?
Fire Force,"I'm going to agree with A LOT of what you said. Hands down the worst season. It didn't get good or interesting until episode 9!! ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The whole ""Eat the Rich"" drama was over the top. None of the characters were good. Over the top, bad acting and hey who cares. Zero investment. Yes in season 2 & 3 there were over the top characters but the writing and acting brought them to life. Forty! Loved him! Sherry and Cary! Hysterical! There's no saving the ""Eat the Rich"" crew! No depth and uuuggghhhh so poorly portrayed.

Was taking that storyline sooooo far worth the payoff at the end! Not sure! 9 episodes were wasted. And really why oh why wouldn't Nadia call the police immediately when she found Marianne. And run like hell when she saw Joe!.ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Fire Force,[deleted]
Fire Force,"This show is not going for awards. It knows what it wants and executed on it. I love it. I just started, ‚ÄúYour Honor‚Äù. The judge is every bit of fuck up like Walter White was. It‚Äôs cringey, but I‚Äôm sure they know this."
Fire Force,What I don‚Äôt get is now Joe has multiple personality disorder? Lol it would make sense if that was the case since season 1
Fire Force,"I'm just starting to watch season 4. I love the quasi Hercule Poirot whodunit with a established group of suspects in a modern, but traditional English setting. There was even a nod to Agatha Christie in the library! I hope there are more seasons set in Europe.

Binge watched it. Talented writing. Excellent."
Fire Force,The blackmailing to kill rhys made no sense because it implied Kate‚Äôs dad knew rhys has something on joe. In reality rhys doesn‚Äôt know who tf joe is
Fire Force,"  
I thought that idea of ""tricking the murderer"" was crazy. The show's reasoning was that he would honor Marianne's wishes and put her where anyone can find her, but who's to say that he actually does that? He could have buried her alive and the plan would have failed. Also the friend was not worried that her friend had not showed up for months on end? I don't buy it.   
  
Also, the whole not calling the cop thing, made not logical sense. Oh well he's going to come after me. Well not if Nadia has images of the ""trophies"" and actually shows the cops where exactly it is. He can be traced back to California and New York. This will be enough information for a full on investigation to take place. The cops are going to have to listen to the couple (black woman and white man) from the previous season. they can confirm that he had them locked in there. This will exonerate the Stamos's character of the murder of the first love interest.   
  
Kate's father character did not make much sense to me. You did ""a lot"" of digging on this guy, something a reverse image search could have accomplished. And all that the dad discovered was the situation with Joe and his former wife, that's it. No links to anymore there or New York. To continue, the father was just ok with it all, and Kate as well, was ok with him being a sociopathy serial killer. This is crazy writing. Really no-one had any smart thinking in this season, it was full of coincidences and dumb decisions.   
  
  
Lady Phoebe's whole storyline was a waste of time. I was thinking that there was going to be a connection with her storyline and Joe's, but nope. She seemed like she was cool with him killing, as long as the body was hidden, crazy. Her going to teach kids at the end was nice, but her and all of the other side characters were a waste of screen time."
Fire Force,It took you until season four to realise the writing makes no sense?
Fire Force,"your complaints make no sense, ur questioning why a psychopathic killer who was experiencing dissociation killed people because of ""not much rationalization"" and yes not hiding Mariennes body was questionable but to me hiding her body was just extra work that wasnt necessary, he hides bodies that would be linked to him, NOt hiding her body isnt a ""plot twist"" in my opinion"
Fire Force,I‚Äôm happy with this season tbh. Much better than the coattail riding season of 3 from season 2
Fire Force,Anyone think Kate gives Ghislaine Maxwell vibes?
Fire Force,Another major plot hole I found ridiculous was the way in which Nadia found Marianne. It seems extremely unrealistic to me that nadia simply saw photos of joe frequently eating at that Indian place and somehow put together exactly where Marianne was . Not to mention the fact that she broke into an extremely observant serial killers home 2x and he didn‚Äôt even notice (even tho he had a camera planted in the same room) .
Fire Force,"I agree with all the points made by OP. It wasn‚Äôt fun to watch (yes, I still did), there were so many plot holes and the fact that they tried to give him a redemption arc and then gave him a happy ending is so old and predictable. Based on how they begun this season, they could‚Äôve ended it so much stronger."
Fire Force,"**Could not agree more.** 

I found it painful watching the characters time after time make weird decisions. Joe started as a killer who killed but had thought behind it- in this season he seemed to turn into a psycho with no remorse and now will be killing for fun for Kate? HUUH

Watched it all but MY GOD, disliked the character assassination throughout. They have truely ruined his character, I can only predict the next season:

\- Joe kills for Kate

\- He over steps

\- She confronts him

\- They argue

\- If they want another season: she dies. If they are ending it: he dies. 

&#x200B;

Ez

Was nice to see Love again, though."
Fire Force,"I completely agree with you. This season was absolute garbage. Honestly, I was so mad when it was revealed that Rhys was just a figment of Joe‚Äôs imagination. It is incredibly cheap- just for shock value. Joe‚Äôs behavior does not make sense. Most of the character‚Äôs behaviors don‚Äôt. Season three Joe literally didn‚Äôt kill anyone without a thorough reason (Ryan and Love). He even ended up saving Theo and tried to let Gil free. Now we are supposed to believe that he just kills mindlessly, without reason? They really did assassinate his character. Does Netflix expected us to have forgotten what they laid out in previous seasons? honestly I‚Äôm incredibly mad and disappointed."
Fire Force,The problem with this season for me is that I hated every character. Even Kate‚Ä¶. No love for her. The first part was ok with the who did it theme. Yeah I‚Äôm still a you Stan but this season was just meh for me.
Fire Force,It reminded me of the dude that does AHS. Very interesting and pretty good until it has to wrap up and everything gets thrown out the window and you feel like you wasted your time
Fire Force,That‚Äôs how I felt until this season. It was sooo nonsensical that it wasn‚Äôt even fun anymore
Fire Force,What was plot armor about joe in this 2nd part? I swear yall love throwing that word around when theres plausable reasons for whatever it is
Fire Force,"How many people are going to use the useless phrase ""plot armor"" üòí use your big words and explain exactly what you mean!"
Fire Force,"It's fun to watch a villain do what they do best! It's never been about Joe finding justice or completely believable murders. It's about a twisted man who justifies his actions any way he can.

I think he kills so easily because he's unraveling, and I for one love to see it. I'll also be watching till the end :)"
Fire Force,"I like the show a lot but I found it strange how the whole goal for him has been redemption, yet they leaned into him being an evil, non-regretful killer now‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm confused where they‚Äôre gonna go next"
Fire Force,Joe has the good lawyers üòÇ
Fire Force,"Not only that but Marianne wrote that in the letter she left for Joe that he read and then burned.

She literally requested that her buddy be found so that her daughter would have closure. 

It was not luck it was all part of the plan to keep her body safe and I guess there OP missed that part."
Fire Force,Right. So now she hasn't been found because she got up and left? Surely smart Joe would have realised there was no report of her death. She would have been identified from dental records or maybe even ID on her body as Joe wanted to make sure her daughter got closure?
Fire Force,The season 4 love interest will frustrate you even more
Fire Force,You should watch it. It will piss you off
Fire Force,">Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn‚Äôt want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience. Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

>Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe ‚Äúdies‚Äù in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

No the plan doesn't make sense at all. Too many things could go wrong. You don't get locked up for months and decide to remain locked up with someone that hasn't fed you for a while. There was even no guarantee he would return. The plan to kill a professional could also easily go wrong. 

>The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just needs to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù allows ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he‚Äôs always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous

I don't have a  problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire. 

Joe in past seasons never killed for flimsy reasons. Why would Joe kill a drunk girl cos she said: the murders started after he appeared.

No one even took her seriously.

Joe mostly kills for obsession, love or to protect himself or those he loves. Even when he kills bad people, it isn't for flimsy reasons like that.

>As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe.

He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that"
Fire Force,It has to be believable to some degree to be fun to watch. Otherwise it‚Äôs magical realism and that‚Äôs not what this show was supposed to be.
Fire Force,I feel like finding a dead homeless person in a busy city wouldn't rank highly on most news days but who knows.
Fire Force,"I know a lot of people disliked Beck when the first season was initially airing, but she had by far and away the most chemistry with Joe, and the writing for her was far stronger than any of the love interests that came after her."
Fire Force,I noticed that at the end. They just wanted him back in New York with no credible story on how to get him there
Fire Force,"You can't even read and understand what I typed. You just rushed to defend

I said it makes no sense that she would fake her death rather than just escape or call the police. It makes no sense because she had no idea what he would do to her body.

Remember he burnt his ex-wife...there's no guarantee he wouldn't cut up Marienna or bury her

Her gamble makes absolutely no sense especially when you look at the easy option of getting him arrested...which she refused to do because PLOT"
Fire Force,"That is what I though too. Nadia had  some pictures and is like, yup this is where he keeps his victims. This was too convenient."
Fire Force,"Completely agree, how would you say to end it? I thought they chose the worst option but not sure how I would've wanted it to continue. Almost wish it ended with him killing himself: unsatisfying, but an ending."
Fire Force,"There‚Äôs going to be another season?!??! People need to stop ruining good things. You‚Äôs expiration date was max season three, maybe even two."
Fire Force,"The show was adapted from it's books....

But I heard only up to Book 3 has been released...so Netflix went their own way for S4...

Explains the mediocre writing"
Fire Force,Felt this after season 3. But I thoroughly enjoyed season 4 more
Fire Force,I‚Äôm with you. Felt like they killed it this season. This want early joe
Fire Force,Seriously. He died but was lucky to get revived from the bay. It is broad daylight but no one sees him slit someone‚Äôs throat. His gf is apathetic to him being the one who murdered all her friends and her dad.
Fire Force,I was thinking about a news report at least of her body but ya know. ‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏èTv magic‚ú®Ô∏è‚ú®Ô∏è
Fire Force,">The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience.

Of course getting the police would be the better plan, but she was traumatized, scared, tired, etc. The only thing that was keeping her going was her daughter. She wanted to get home and make sure the glove-trotting serial killer would never find her again.

>Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

We‚Äôre talking about after Marienne had already ‚Äúdied‚Äù though. He didn‚Äôt care about burning Love‚Äôs dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn‚Äôt love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn‚Äôt raise any red flags.

>I don't have a problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire.

Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what‚Äôs going on he‚Äôs no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

&#x200B;

>He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.  
For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that

He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media. He can erase any connection Joe has to Kate or himself. Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads."
Fire Force,The whole point though was for Marienne to be found and identified for her daughter to get Closure so surely Joe would want to make sure his great plan of leaving her on a bench with a weak pulse definitely worked?
Fire Force,And her reaction to finding out his depravity was accurate
Fire Force,Agreed. I think they set it up for another season... I guess we shall see.
Fire Force,That makes sense
Fire Force,"So do you not know how the real world works. As stated in the show there are people watching the area because its a popular spot for people to jump from. And do you not believe in medicine or science? From personal experience i can tell you people survive drowning. When i was like 16 i got pulled out to sea and was basically dead, but here i am writing this. The only unrealistic thing about that scenario was how fast his recovery time was.

Did you not see the body was hidden in a non populated area behind a car with trees around. Its not that hard to understand‚Ä¶. He didnt just kil him in the middle of a busy highway 

Joe never said he killed all her friends and dad. He only specified that he killed people before. And we know kate is not all the way sane either. She is used to her father disappearing people (killing them) she herself gave kids cancer. And she did dispose of a body previously with joe. She loves him and so she accepts him. 

Im really trying to understand how this is plot armor to u, its not rocket science."
Fire Force,Good point on that. Just another thing to move the story along. unfortunately...
Fire Force,">We‚Äôre talking about after Marienne had already ‚Äúdied‚Äù though. He didn‚Äôt care about burning Love‚Äôs dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn‚Äôt love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn‚Äôt raise any red flags.

This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.


>Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what‚Äôs going on he‚Äôs no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.


>He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media.

Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads.

Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice"
Fire Force,"My man was a serial killer walking around in broad daylight, who just so happened to end up with a billionaire girlfriend that was okay with him killing at least one person that she personally knew. It's also absolutely bonkers that he committed all of those murders himself and never got caught. Like the police in London must be absolute dipshits to not put 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 together. Also the absolutely stupidest part of the entire season was Nadia not calling the cops immediately when she found Marianne. Like her being a little Nancy Drew and conveniently fucking the whole thing up was just incredibly lucky for Joe, and the show even hinted at his plot armor here. ""If you call the cops on him he'll just weasel away again."" I'm sorry but Joe is one of the most plot armored characters I've ever seen in fiction."
Fire Force,">This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.

I‚Äôm not denying that it‚Äòs a gamble or irrational. I‚Äôm just saying she‚Äôs a traumatized, desperate woman trying to make sure her serial killer kidnapper/stalker can never come looking for her again.

>This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.

Of course not, he‚Äôs crazy. He thinks a guy whose book he read and is running for mayor is blackmailing him.

Also I‚Äôd argue that he‚Äôs *always* smart enough to cover his tracks. When he‚Äôs more stable he comes up with it on his own. But when he‚Äôs split into Joe and ‚ÄúRhys‚Äù, his mind rationalizes the importance of cleaning up his own messes by coming up with  blackmail schemes and avoiding being ‚Äúframed.‚Äù

&#x200B;

>Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice

If Tom was running for mayor I‚Äôd agree, but he‚Äôs just financially backing Rhys‚Äôs political opponent. Plus, like I said, he can bury stories. No one knows Kate was responsible for children getting cancer when she was 19. If the media found out Joe killed Rhys, who would look deeper into Joe and Kate? Joe‚Äôs only friends are Kate‚Äôs friends. They barely know him, and they‚Äôre all too self-absorbed or too dead to cause a fuss in the media. Plus they would want to protect Kate anyway."
Fire Force,"Your a clown right. Your mad about the plot of you? The fact that he met kathryn a woman with a rich dad? He litteraly stalked her at first it was bound to happen. Do you know how many murders arent caught? Its a higher number thank you would think. What 2 and 2 are the police supposed to put together exactly? With the fire at the masion joe was also almost killed so thats good cover. Joe doesnt know rhys so they suspect him of killing him. Nadia wanted to call the police you dumbass. That was her first instinct but marienne (however u spell it) told her no because she knows joe is smart and can get out of tricky spots or flee. How did nadia fuck it up??? She litteraly helped her escape the cage. It was just her need to see justice putting a serial killer away that got her caught.  You can litterally do your own research instead of bitchin.‚ÄúOften, a serial killer kills for quite some time and they get sloppy but in general the sloppiness is a result of a mental/emotionally spiraling out of control.‚Äù There are lots of murderers and killers that we walk by everyday and have no idea because they seem like the ‚Äúaverage joe‚Äù. It seems your just mad that he keep getting away, but if you used your brain you can connect the dots on how he gets things done. Also at the end of the day this is a fiction show, every show gives character luck or some amount of plot armor to do what they do"
Fire Force,"** The one thought that keeps stumping me. Is that at Rhys announcing his candidacy for mayor. Fruitcake crazy, Dawn takes a picture of both Rhys and Joe standing next to each other. 

So does that mean that since they've been seen together... There's a good chance it wasn't just Joe by himself. All along?"
Fire Force,Lmao you seem like the only mad one in the conversation. Imagine glorifying a TV program so much that you would write an entire essay to defend it‚Äôs ridiculous plot points that make absolutely no sense in the real world.
Fire Force,"I know people keep digging into the physical vs. digital debate, so I will try to avoid it as much as possible:

- If you want physical, then buy each season as it releases. Studios will often pull the plug on physical releases if sales of early seasons aren't good enough, especially if there is reformatting/remastering/digitization to be done. This is why we will never see Star Trek DS9 in high definition. 
- If you want digital, then it really doesn't matter. You can look out for sales and get an idea if you're worried about price.

I don't think it matters all that much."
Fire Force,"I'm not sure if this will be discussed at length, but there are hidden costs and trade-offs when choosing to purchase and build a content library online vs purchasing physical media.

This is something you might want to think carefully about.

With online content sold from providers like Amazon you do not actually own the content you purchase. You're renting it.  Amazon can remove purchased content at any time.

Studios sometimes get into disputes with content providers. Last year there was a dispute between WarnerMedia and Amazon leading to people who purchased the new full season of The Flash having access to content delayed by 1-2 months that they already had paid for.

With physical media you own a physical copy of the content, but over time physical media can become damaged or degrade, and playback devices may fail or eventually become unavailable."
Fire Force,"If you buy something today from a streaming retailers (iTunes, Vudu, Google, Amazon, whoever), there's no way to guarantee that the service will still be available whenever you have kids. That service, or that particular content on the service, could possibly be gone as soon as next month. No matter how huge and stable the company seems to be at the moment. You just never know.  

Meanwhile, people still have record albums and videogame carts and video tapes from decades ago, and machines to play them, and everything still works.  

This is why I'd rather buy my most favorite TV shows on a DVD, or a Blu-ray Disc. And have multiple devices in the house to play them (I even have a cheap player still in the box, in a storage unit up the street, as my most fail-safe backup in case I ever need it).  

Streaming services and their servers are out of your control. Physical media is something you'll always be able to own."
Fire Force,"maximize the cost.

pay as much as you possibly can.

&#x200B;

by each ep individually."
Fire Force,First look for streaming services that give access to those shows in my opinion
Fire Force,I am getting physical. But the question is should i get them by season when they come out or what for the complete season comes out?
Fire Force,Buy physical and digitize it.
Fire Force,"> over time physical media can become damaged or degrade

It's possible this can happen, and it does from time to time. But it is extremely uncommon for it to happen within the original owner's lifetime. I don't think people should worry about this.  

> and playback devices may fail or eventually become unavailable  

Working playback devices are still available for media that was made in the 1950s and 60s. Check eBay, LOL."
Fire Force,Yes I know but that isn‚Äôt the question I am asking. I am wondering if I should buy something one season at a time or buy it when it is a complete set?
Fire Force,[deleted]
Fire Force,"Depends on the show, and depends on the extras. For example, the bonus content that came with the DVD release of the Lord of the Rings extended edition films is far superior to what came with either the extended trilogy set or the individual extended films on BR."
Fire Force,"> It's possible this can happen, and it does from time to time. But it is extremely uncommon for it to happen within the original owner's lifetime. I don't think people should worry about this. 

Some types of media are more susceptible to data loss.  Optical media has varying shelf lives, but usually it's less than 10 years.  That's assuming it's not exposed to ultraviolet light or other conditions which might cause media to degrade faster.

> Working playback devices are still available for media that was made in the 1950s and 60s. Check eBay, LOL.

Yes that's an option.  I meant more along the lines of finding new unused playback devices."
Fire Force,"I understand, and I'll answer that now since you ask again. But I wanted to take a minute and talk about streaming vs physical media, since I don't believe that this part of the equation gets enough attention these days. Sure, physical media takes up room. But it's worth it, to truly own it. As somebody else said, digital media is really only rented under license, and never truly owned.  

Let's answer your real question, though. Here's my thoughts about that, as an entertainment writer who's covered home video releases of TV shows for 19 years now.  

If it's already available as a complete series set, then it's more cost effective to buy it that way.  

On the other hand, if it's in the process of being released season-by-season, buy each season as it becomes available, esp. if you can pre-order it (or buy it during release week) at any kind of discount. Or otherwise get it on sale at all.  

If a studio decides that the most recently-released season didn't sell well enough, and that there aren't enough customers for that show any more, then they stop producing home video releases of the next season. And a complete series set will never ever get put out in the long run.  

So for a currently airing show, like Rick & Morty, go ahead and buy each season as it becomes available. For a show that's already done and finished, and the complete series is available on home video - like Steven Universe (available on digital already, and hitting DVD tomorrow) - then go ahead and buy it that way!"
Fire Force,How?
Fire Force,I 100% have optical media older than 10 years that still works.  I don't know what kind of shit you are on
Fire Force,">  Optical media has varying shelf lives, but usually it's less than 10 years  

Don't make me laugh. I've got dozens of DVDs from 1999 that still work (and hundreds more since then!). I've also got hundreds of music CDs from the 80s  and 90s which still work. I have thousands of optical media discs in my library, and despite constant playing of ""old titles"" as I go back to the well and enjoy stuff I bought a LOOOONG time ago, I still haven't run across a single item which has degraded and no longer works!  

Public and school libraries are also loaning tons of discs older than 10 years which continue to work and haven't degraded."
Fire Force,"Optical discs that are pressed tend to last a lot longer, but are still susceptible to the same times of wear and damage. Burned media can have a much shorter lifespan, which is what I was thinking of at the time I posted, which really doesn't apply.

I didn't think so many would respond so angrily"
Fire Force,"I‚Äôm not angry. Just trying to correct inaccurate information.  

As for burned discs? The Warner Archive Collection launched in 2009, 11 years ago. I have DVDs from the first few months of the launch of that program. They still work.  

A lot of fear mongering goes on about physical media deteriorating, and it has been especially hyped up on ‚ÄúMOD‚Äú (manufacture on demand) DVD releases. Don‚Äôt believe the hype. Even an MOD release is unlikely to deteriorate past the point of working in the lifetime of its original owner.  

Studios like selling physical media, because it makes them some money. You know what they like more? Digital media. And they like you liking it. It makes them even more money, and they control it more easily. And a user who wants to get it cheap can‚Äôt buy it used. So the studios fudge the risks of digital media where service discontinuation and server outage are concerned. And they promote the fears about physical media deteriorating, and players going off the market. They talk up issues like how much shelf space in your home it takes up, and how digital is all in the cloud (where it may not take up your shelf space, but you have zero control over it, either).  

Can digital media be gotten illegally? Sure. But studios think along the lines of ‚Äúpeople who do that, won‚Äôt buy the DVDs either.‚Äú at least not new DVDs at full price, where the studio gets their cut of the money. When a consumer buys digital media from Google, iTunes, Vudu, or whoever‚Ä¶ the studio always gets their full share of the profits. and they like that a hell of a lot more than they like DVD or Blu-ray.  

I enjoy having my DVD of The Devil‚Äôs Advocate, with Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves. it‚Äôs an original version, before they altered the ending scene due to the lawsuit. I enjoy having my VHS tape of the closest-to-original Star Wars (‚ÄúEpisode IV‚Äù) ever legally put on home video. I enjoy having my Simpsons DVD season sets, including the episode with Michael Jackson. They can change that shit on the servers, behind your back and without your consent, no matter what you paid for. But they are not knocking on my door and telling me to hand them over!  

Consumers need to make up their own mind about what‚Äôs best for them. Especially collectors with long range plans!"
Fire Force,"Everything that gets adapted has to make decisions about what to keep, what to change, and what to dump. Sometimes things that work in a game or on a book doesn‚Äôt translate well on screen. Plus you have to deal with the personal likes and dislikes of the director/show runners.

Parts of the Tolkien estate were livid about the changes Peter Jackson made to Lord of the Rings. Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and other movies are quite different from the books they are based on.

Sometimes these producers misunderstand why something is popular, or are fans themselves and now get to make their own fan fiction into a production (I secretly believe that is what is happening with the Witcher).  Or they are just mercenaries with too big of an ego to follow the source material too closely, because reasons (like ego, a fan who now gets to do their fan fiction, etc). And sometimes these show runners haven‚Äôt the stones to say NO to studio interference and notes.

As for the greater representation-sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses. Every TV show and movie is a product of its times, and during these times, being intentional about representation matters. Bridgerton plays fast and loose with race in whatchacallit England, and there is basically a collective shrug. I argue that it comes down to if you are enjoying the show, it doesn‚Äôt matter, but if you aren‚Äôt, then you pick apart everything."
Fire Force,"TLOU is basically perfect for adaptation. Besides the obviously cinematic storytelling of the games, the story is also the perfect length for 1 season of prestige TV.

Wheel of Time is 15!! long books. You either need to bet that you can adapt 1 book per season and maintain an audience for nearly 2 decades (w/ production time) or you try to adapt the story over a reasonable period of time. That can mean seriously altering some storylines in order to make that work. This isn't cart blanche to make a bad product but something has got to give."
Fire Force,"WoT was never, ever going to be adapted as-is. the first book was not very good, and there overall story is so gendereded it just wouldn't work in 2023.

That said I did hate the finale. gonna watch S2 but I'm not optimistic for what Rafe has planned."
Fire Force,"Because staying faithful isn‚Äôt a winning formula, good writing/writing what people like is a winning formula.

The reality is that most people don‚Äôt care about changes to the source material because most people aren‚Äôt familiar with the source material. The ones who get upset are just louder."
Fire Force,TLOU lends itself very well to a reasonably direct translation to screen. Most properties don't.
Fire Force,"Dumb take that just panders to the current internet outrage.  The Last of Us proves that make a good show is a winning formula, it proves nothing about liberties with adaptations. You can make a shit direct adaptation.  You can make a magnificent show that takes a ton of liberties with the source material. Surprise Surprise, HBO show is better than Amazon show, just like literally every other comparison between those two networks. 


Also, looking forward to this take aging when the show inevitably deviates from the game."
Fire Force,It is certainly not the only formula.  Arcane barely references much about the video game at all and makes no reference whatsoever to the key story of the video game.  And it is widely regarded as fucking awesome
Fire Force,"Creative people in Hollywood want to be creative. So when you give them someone else's work they want to show everyone how creative they are so they wind up competing with the authors work they are supposed to be adapting. It doesn't end well. There is a reason they are making a show based on this author. Tolkien doesn't need your input. Robert Jordan doesn't need anyone fucking around with his creation.   


Nobody in the writers room stops them. They just cash the checks and crank out whatever the lead wants. If not we get a Tom Shippey. A Tolkien scholar hired by the showrunners of Rings of Power. He was fired pretty early on. Didn't want him in the writers room. Was stifling their creativity.  


With Witcher blood origins we had someone else's creative vision that was just a parasite on the original work and lore. That is what these creatives who can't adapt someone else's work are. Parasites who are using a known talent to try and pretend like they aren't mediocre."
Fire Force,"I don't know why the morons in this thread are responding they way they are. They're knocking down strawmen at best and spouting stupid diarrhea all over the thread everywhere. The Last of Us, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones are all largely faithful to the source material. Most scenes are straight from the source with combining and cuts to save time. Most new content inserted doesn't really work.

Then you look at a show like Wheel of Time and it was obvious from the trailer they were changing everything. It's hard to even articulate the changes they made because it's everything. It's easier to talk about the changes to LotR....Oh, they cut Tom Bombadil, oh Merry and Pippin joining was expedited, oh Gandalf left for 17 years and the movie kind of makes it look like he was gone a few weeks. And it's like why, why, why? And the answer is again and again 'to save time, to save time, to save time.' 

When you look at the first season of WoT, which is based on one of the strongest books in the series (people are wrong about this book constantly), probably one of the most adaptable books in the series, just open the first fucking epsiode and go scene by scene. 

1. moiraine gives clunky dialogue giving an overview of her mission, undermining her mystique and purpose in the book

2. Men Run from Red Ajah - I actually like this scene, but it doesn't fit well in the rest of the show, and is based in a bad decision to move up Aes Sedai stuff.

3. Lan and Moiraine watch from above and go 'there are four Ta'veren in the two rivers'. Top fucking KeK

4. Egwene gets her braid and jumps into a river - garbage addition

5. Minute 7 we get the first book resembling scene with Tam and Rand on the quarry road. None of the dialogue is from the book other than a mention of the wolves coming down from the mountain. Let's say the wolves mention is about 10 seconds. 

6. Arrive in town to pre-Bel Tine celebration. None of which was in the books. Mat Rand and Perrin dice, and have interactions that aren't from the book. Perrin is Married. The mention a war in Ghealdan. Mat goes off to rob a random black lady of her bracelet and everyoen claps for Egwene when she enters. I guess we can give 5 seconds for showing Rand worried about Egwene and 5 seconds for Tam unloading the wagon for Bel Tine, and 15 seconds for mentioning Ghealdan war

So We're 10 minutes into the WoT pilot now and I'd say around 35 seconds, or 5.8% of what's happening is taken from the book. The percentage does not get better from here. 

You're complaining about adaptations that keep single digit percentage straight from the source vs. LotR which almost every scene is from the book. Frodo is Bilbo's heir, they throw birthday party, Bilbo disappears, Bilbo goes on a journey after Gandalf gets upset about his disappearing ring, Gandalf leaves to investigate, Gandalf comes back and says it's bad and they have to go (here's a structural difference as timings are much different and it's not a sudden rush), Sam overhears, they leave together, they hook up with Merry and Pippin on their way out blah blah blah blah blah

In the WoT show a girl jumps into a river because physical injury didn't matter in medieval level of tech times, a boy and his dad walk into town but don't see a mysterious stranger. It doesn't turn out there are many strangers in town, which they meet, one of which is the elegant lady Moiraine who they all want to please, instead the Lady Moiraine walks into the pub and flashes her big Aes Sedai dick ring and goes, I'm very important give me a room. She doesn't subtlely investigate to try to figure out if what she's looking for is here. And for some reason Perrin is married but resents his wife because he wants Egwene and Rand and Egwene are fucking and Mat is a thief with a drunk of a father and super poor. 

The responses and votes in this thread are embarrassing."
Fire Force,"I think adaptations being good or bad come down to a few things:

1. The directors/writers/etc on the adaptation are artists too and artists inherently want to input some of their own creativity and vision

2. Like you said there is a lot more money on the line when making a tv show or a movie then a book and thus a lot more market research is done and if that market research indicates something from the book won‚Äôt be received well they tend to go that way even if it‚Äôs ill fated

3. Movies are usually a lot shorter than books; tv shows a lot longer. Something is always going to have to be added or taken out. These new pieces or cuts are critical and can make or break the piece. Conversely, video games usually have much more straight forward content than books, which spend a lot of time on exposition, simile, character descriptions, foreshadowing, etc."
Fire Force,"im glad i haven't read wheel of time or the parts of lotr books rings of power is based on, i like them both personally. the last of us aired a single episode, so who knows what could change by the end of it."

In The Dark,"Really loved season 1, but felt like a different show in the next seasons. Still watched it all and had mixed feelings about the seasons after."
In The Dark,"In the Dark has such an addicting concept. ""let's make a series about a blind woman you hate so you'll watch each week to see her dog herself in one deep hole after another."""
In The Dark,"Season 1 is amazing, after that it slowly gets sillier and more unrealistic to the point where in the last couple seasons the characters just start doing things completely out of character just to move the plot forward and things happen ""cause reasons"". I wish I could spoil the police station scene, its the most eye-rolling shit Ive ever seen on television. Its enjoyable if you like ridiculous comedies, but it becomes a far cry from the serious drama of the first season."
In The Dark,the finale was rushed and really bad.
In The Dark,"I actually stopped watching b/c it became TOO breaking bad in the later seasons. 

But first season was great. The influence was more Sherlock Holmes than BB."
In The Dark,Josh is the worst.
In The Dark,Wasn't sure which show you were talking about but realized it's that one my bf and I call Breaking Blind
In The Dark,"I too enjoy this show, still have to finish the last season"
In The Dark,Season 1 is great. the rest is pretty much garbage but I kept watching anyway
In The Dark, necesito que vivamos esto alg√∫n dia
In The Dark,"I had a really different reaction to Mattfield‚Äôs take on the visual impaired. Ignoring the problematic issue that they could have easily cast someone with visual impairment in the role. Mattfield‚Äôs eyes break character constantly, she makes eye contact with other actors and she follows other actors movements with her eyes as the move through scenes. I thought it was really poor acting."
In The Dark,Did you really compare a CW show to BB?
In The Dark,"I liked it a lot! very different tv show compared to what the CW was airing, I've always find it funny when watching a show and a character name is Felix because that's my name also, I have seen many Felix's lately and i used to think my name wasn't as common."
In The Dark,"Lol, it starts out great, then after each season you go wtf was that? Yet you just cannot turn away."
In The Dark,"My gf and I loved S1, but have progressively enjoyed each season less and less. I haven‚Äôt started this final one yet, gf says it‚Äôs the worst one."
In The Dark,"My take as well. The lightness, humor, and ability to actually *like* the characters was eroded away the farther they got into being a *Breaking Bad* imitation.  Murphy by the end was pretty heinous as a character.

I also wish they'd ended the show one episode earlier than they did."
In The Dark,"Sorry, but I had to laugh at the typo ""dog herself in...""

Hmm, Murphy works at a dog training facility.

She has a dog named ""pretzel.""

But yeah, it's like one disaster after the next.

Cheers. Merry Xmas."
In The Dark,"I should have said no spoilers. I just started season 4. 

Still, I found it amusing amongst all the crap that's on."
In The Dark,That's a funny analogy.
In The Dark,Yeah what the show turned into was really disappointing. They tried to turn it into a crime thriller when it was great how it was.
In The Dark,poquito habla espanol.
In The Dark,"I think she does pretty well with the role. They tried finding blind actors for the part, but she portrayed the character so well, they went with her. She shadowed a blind person for months to try to get the feel of what it would be like to be blind, but it is a difficult thing to do having sight.

Also, she was supposedly blinded as a teenager, who would already look to people speaking to her. I would assume the attention to them would be audio cues leading her to look in their direction."
In The Dark,"Yeah, I gave that a try and couldn't stick with it. I just didn't like the main character."
In The Dark,"Only the first season though, and maybe the second"
In The Dark,"Lol. Americans have literally destroyed all meaning of the word ""amazing"". Every single last thing is amazing to them."
In The Dark,Yeah I watched a few more seasons than I should have.  Eventually it dawned on my the main character was terrible yet the show made her the protagonist.
In The Dark,It is on my list to check out.
In The Dark,See also: ‚Äúawesome‚Äù
In The Dark,You sound like a very well-functioning person!
In The Dark,Me? Yep. I'm AMAZING!
In The Dark,"Said it before, I‚Äôll say it again. We need their version of Treasure Island now! Black Sails was such a fantastic show."
In The Dark,[deleted]
In The Dark,I remember binging this show years after it came back and I was blown away by it. I couldn't believe it wasn't more popular.
In The Dark,Man I miss this show.
In The Dark,One of the best monologues ever
In The Dark,"The ""*I'll stand here with you for an hour...*"" speech (4:37) is for me one of the most moving lines in TV history. The writers didn't cheese that scene with something corny like ""*please don't make me to do this*"". They delivered something unique."
In The Dark,"This speech really cemented the central themes for the show and what kind of story it wanted to tell. First season was somewhat slow, but Black Sails progressed really nicely and basically each season was better than the previous one. 4 seasons and 38 episodes is a suitable length, ideal for a rather quick rewatch. Show ends properly, but leaves you wanting for more, and once everything is said and done, it leaves a lingering impact, and that is a good thing."
In The Dark,Bear McCreary fucking killed the OST for this show.
In The Dark,"More people should watch this. Its got some fantastic characters, the actors performances are astounding, real stakes, real tension, real passion and that intro? Mmm mmm! I put it off for a long time cause I was like, meh, pirates. But its a show that starts good and becomes fantastic as it goes and it does something a lot of these big sprawling dramas have trouble with. It ends. In a satisfying way."
In The Dark,"I liked that the show didn't go so much for realism/naturalism, but instead embraced flowery monologues.

Not everything has to be grey and real."
In The Dark,I'm actually watching this show for the first time at the moment. It's really really great.
In The Dark,"Rough first season, but wonderful for the rest. Flint is my favorite TV character‚ÄîToby Stephens is just such a powerhouse in this role.

I love that the themes of the show remain consistent throughout all 4 seasons: shame/rumor as a tool for society, questioning the barbarity of England bringing ‚Äúcivilization‚Äù to Nassau, the complexity of creating an alternate persona, and what it means to live on the fringes of society once you are unjustifiably deemed a monster.

Beautiful visuals, stellar performances, and wonderful dialogue. Please watch it!"
In The Dark,"I always love seeing Black Sails talked about, it‚Äôs one of my favorite series ever. I recommend it whenever I get the chance."
In The Dark,[deleted]
In The Dark,Captain Vane was the only hero on this show.
In The Dark,I‚Äôm slow watching so I still have some episodes left. It‚Äôs so good
In The Dark,"black sails was amazing


criminally underrated


so sad that few people watched it due to starz"
In The Dark,A fantastic show that many people missed because it was stuck on Starz :(
In The Dark,Most underappreciated show of all time. I'm not exaggerating.
In The Dark,One of my favorite shows ever. I still can't believe it ended better than Game of Thrones.
In The Dark,Just learned that Toby Stephens mom is Dame Maggie Smith.
In The Dark,Love this show. Wish they would do Treasure Island now.
In The Dark,"Really liked him in Lost In Space, great actor :)"
In The Dark,"Phenomenal show- in my top 3 for sure. I do a rewatch every year and each time, I appreciate it more and more. Flint and Silver are two of the best examples of character development."
In The Dark,"Its a shame that they said they don't wanna do that, as they would need to change too much to make it tonally similar. But they also said it might happen who knows."
In The Dark,"A few days ago, I read Treasure Island for the first time (having already watched Black Sails years ago, of course). I was stunned at how good it was, and how dynamic John Silver's character is. Im surprised that it hasnt been made into a modern movie recently, but I suppose we are still sleeping off our Johnny Depp hangover."
In The Dark,Steinberg & Levine are too busy trying to get [*The Old Man*](https://deadline.com/2021/08/the-old-man-premiere-fx-on-hulu-series-jeff-bridges-return-to-production-1234814457/) in the can for FX/Hulu. It's based on a Thomas Perry novel about a retired ex-CIA operative (played by Jeff Bridges) who comes out of retirement when he's targeted by assassins.
In The Dark,Maybe they same will be for you someday?
In The Dark,"Must have been the fact that it was Starz right? I'm actually not sure why I watched it, but I'm so glad I did."
In The Dark,I understand why. It starts off as a very slow burn. It took me three tries before I got hooked and now it's one of my all time favorite shows.
In The Dark,One of the best Series Finales ever!
In The Dark,His speech earlier in season three episode 10 at the 44 minute mark is better. Where he basically said he has seen it all so he‚Äôs not worried about John coming for him.
In The Dark,Well said. It truly shows how much love and respect there is between them.
In The Dark,It's one of his best. The Parson's Farewell is an absolute banger.
In The Dark,Here. You need [this video he made about using the hurdy gurdy for the theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DXQ0z9NCl8).
In The Dark,">  It ends. In a satisfying way.

In many regards. But a certain female character basically got rewarded for a lot of shitty and terrible behavior, instead of ""getting what's coming"". And it mildly infuriated me and tainted the ending a bit and just took me out."
In The Dark,"Jack was always one of the smartest and most capable characters on the show, he just lacked the eminence that Silver/Flint/Vane and the other captains had."
In The Dark,He was also a huge piece of shit. His death certainly wasn‚Äôt enough to make him a hero
In The Dark,"What about Eleanor's manservant, the guy that secretly ruled a whole African American colony?"
In The Dark,In my country it was shown on the History Channel for some reason ps. The show was also shot in my country not far from where I live.
In The Dark,His dad was [Robert Stephens](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827137/).
In The Dark,Fun fact- he‚Äôs Maggie Smith‚Äôs son! You should also check out BBC‚Äôs adaptation of And Then There Were None with him in one of the main roles.
In The Dark,"We get a Ray Donovan movie all things, but not this. I know different networks and all but damn‚Ä¶"
In The Dark,I'd never even heard of starz until this show
In The Dark,"Yeah who liked it tend to oversell it a bit. 

I love the show, but it certainly had its ups and downs and as you said, a slow burn start before it found its pace."
In The Dark,"Do you believe John took Flint to be with Thomas, or do you think he lied to Madi? I ask because when they showed them reuniting, it was ambiguous enough to make the viewer make their own decision on what *actually* happened. It‚Äôs also been a while since I‚Äôve watched it so I may be misremembering."
In The Dark,Bad people get good things fairly regularly. I don‚Äôt think a complete storybook ending would have suited the show.
In The Dark,"I'm not saying its perfect. I'm just saying it doesn't do a Firefly and just stop, or a Game of Thrones and botch the ending, or a Supernatural and go on much longer than it should."
In The Dark,"Of everyone in the show, that female character was arguably amongst the least terrible people."
In The Dark,He wasn't a pirate.
In The Dark,You're from South Africa?
In The Dark,The actor who plays Captain Berringer is also his brother! Apparently they tried to get Maggie Smith in the last season but couldn't make it fit with her schedule at the time.
In The Dark,Hey! Leave Ray Donovan out of this!
In The Dark,I think it was a lie. They showed by that point John was basically living up to his Treasure Island reputation. And the way he spoke to Madi near the end really felt like he was trying to convince her of a lie.
In The Dark,"Ha, I‚Äôve watched all of these and you‚Äôve summed up succinctly exactly the things I look to avoid when considering a new show."
In The Dark,"I know, and I was just saying that the ending wasn't really that satisfying for me."
In The Dark,"Relativism is not the answer, when its still unjust. Which was the entire point."
In The Dark,Ah good point.
In The Dark,"Yeah, specifically the Helderberg area just outside Cape Town. You could see the set with the ships from one of the highways leading in to Cape Town (I drove past it quite a few times, if I remember correctly the sets and ships burned down while they were making the 4th season) ps. The crazy Ridley Scott sci-fi show Raised by Wolves is shot in Helderberg as well (new season is coming out today)"
In The Dark,Oh is that why Harriet Walter showed up (with her husband playing her husband) to play Eleanor's grandmother?
In The Dark,Apologies. I watched the show but I got quite bored near the end and finished it‚Äôs last season just to get it out the way. Main reason I‚Äôve avoided the film
In The Dark,"I‚Äôm curious, why do you think it was unjust? Because she played other characters who were already playing her and others? She achieved her position through her own cunning and hard work, and she did so by ruining fewer lives than anyone else. And those she did ‚Äúruin‚Äù, broadly speaking, belonged to those who were making life-altering decisions on behalf of everyone, including her, without ever considering what she wanted. 

It‚Äôs not even about justice or deserving anything; it‚Äôs about her finally being in a position where she chart the course of her own life, which is monumental given her background and her struggles.

Even her decision to pick the side she did was rooted in her not wanting to pursue a war she knew was going to destroy the lives of innocents. Of course, those who wanted to wage the war also had understandable reasons for doing what they wanted, but that doesn‚Äôt mean only one side was right."
In The Dark,I don't know if they ever confirmed it or not but that's what all the fans assumed at the time since it made the most sense.
In The Dark,It was just a joke! Everyone is entitled to their opinions and Ray Donovan certainly isn't above reproach lol. Hell I'm not even caught up on the show (just finished season 3) so it might go heavily downhill for all I know haha.
In The Dark,This is a bloodbath jesus
In The Dark,"I‚Äôve enjoyed all three seasons, glad it‚Äôs going to get a proper sendoff at least."
In The Dark,It's a miracle it made it this far.
In The Dark,"The CW just cancelled the whole network! 

Next year it will be all repeats and all reality all the time!"
In The Dark,I hope they let them know in advance so they didn't film a cliffhanger
SCAMS,"I've always thought that if it's dangerous enough, they should interview the person, rewrite the answers so their mannerisms don't show, and have an actor read it while being disguised."
SCAMS,"I‚Äôve wondered about this as well.  Not just for drugs/scam etc. cases but for informants and whistleblowers too. 

For example, if someone was a mob informant on a documentary and covers their face, I think people they knew for years would probably realize their identity from their body shape, gestures, or style of dressing."
SCAMS,"I've asked someone familiar with such things, and his answer was there are certain topics that involve very dangerous people and they might be willing to answer some questions, but only thru a trusted intermediary (who is also trusted by the crew).  Often they won't meet the subject at all simply because it is far too dangerous to do so. 

Some interviews are on paper only, or they might be audio recordings. The questions are often laid out ahead of time, with restrictions on certain topics/lines of questioning which allows the interviewer to know how far they can press with follow up questions.  This is especially helpful if there is a language barrier, as the intermediary will also be an interpreter and will know when to shut down a question without translating it.

The responses are then acted out, blurred video/masks and distorted audio. This allows for the interviewee to speak a little more freely then they would if being recorded, and also allows some level of plausible deniability should the interviewer get pressed by authorities over who they met and where they met them. Plus, it means that anyone who tries to correct the footage (descrambling the video, adjusting the brightness, or correcting the audio) isn't actually going to unmask the interview subject."
SCAMS,"I have interviewed a lot of informants and also did a major  newspaper series about a couple who were living in the Witness Protection Program. 

""Reformed"" criminals go from exciting adrenalized lives to anonymity in podunk towns and a decent number of them simply get bored and want attention. 

They also delude themselves that they will get paid enough to be consultants on other projects as a result of coming forward and they can spin those gigs into being some kind of producer themselves. 

Also I don't know what the percentages are for how many remain on the straight and narrow under their new identities but the ones I dealt with all ended up getting their hands dirty again.

Bear in mind that if these were criminal geniuses, they probably wouldn't need witness protection."
SCAMS,some of them are fake... most maybe?? i remember watching one a while back which featured my home country. it was a mix of obviously fake interviews and *seemingly* genuine ones.
SCAMS,https://youtu.be/vJki8XXqVws
SCAMS,"With money and ""bad guys"" like to brag about their crimes so they can have what called clout or street cred. For a whistleblower or informate it's to get the truth out there."
SCAMS,">illegal trade so how much can they be getting paid to make it worth the risk of death should they be recognized??

but they're not ""unrecognized"" IRL are they? so is there really any additional risk compared to ""day to day life"" in the illegal drug trade?

&#x200B;

i don't think ""nat-geo"" does anything more than record evidence that could be used against them.. (the cops are not UNAWARE of their IRL identities, either).

&#x200B;

risk of getting shot already exists.

risk of getting arrested already exists.

not sure risk is that much worse."
SCAMS,"Y'all do understand that Pyromaniacs have been known to have orgasms at the scene of the fire they set themselves, right?"
SCAMS,I guess some use proxy
SCAMS,"Some UK shows announce that was done. I assume the rest, and some US shows, do it but don‚Äôt say."
SCAMS,"Yeah, there is no way those people would ever go onto television as themselves. Besides a persons stature, the mannerisms and speech patterns alone would be enough to recognize a person well known within their networks."
SCAMS,"Exactly. It's SO risky for them, what's the incentive?"
SCAMS,I dont think you're right here. They could be putting themselves in more jeopardy especially if they were like moles or informants that infiltrated drug rings or whatever may have you. I think its more about what they say that will be more dangerous for them after the video ends because someone always knows someone.
SCAMS,Just like Disney stars do more risky roles as they get older Aunt Becky spent Christmas in jail to escape being typecast as generic nice woman.
SCAMS,"Wow, I remember when this was first reported. That seems like eons ago. I suppose any news from before the pandemic seems like a million years ago now.  





Remember ISIS?  What happened to that?"
SCAMS,[deleted]
SCAMS,the worst part was the dementors.
SCAMS,"2 months is just enough of a sentence so she can make a career out of it, just enough to have a story to say on tv panels and to make a title for her gohst written autbiography *Lori Laughlin's ""my life in orange"": mistakes and penance""*"
SCAMS,I don't understand the logic in this.  They have enough money to go to college any where else.        What was so special at USC?
SCAMS,"Just in time for holidays. New Year, fresh start.

Edit:  ""Loughlin also must serve two years of supervised release, perform 100 hours of community service and pay a fine of $150,000"". Well, not really."
SCAMS,"To the people who are mad about her getting out so soon: Lori Loughlin was not arrested for paying to get her kid into college. Lori Loughlin was arrested for trying to get a deal on it. It's completely legal to buy your kid into college, which is what should really piss you off."
SCAMS,I'm not defending her but in my opinion the college admission people should get more time behind bars than this woman. Parents are always going to try a way to game the system to get the best for their child. The gatekeeper against this type of behavior falls upon the college admission people who I believe ethically have a larger burden.
SCAMS,Did she get let go early because the prison was a Full House?
SCAMS,What I find sad and disturbing about this case is that it got far more attention and public outrage than the hundreds of elected officials that do things every day that have a far greater negative effect on the lives of far more people.
SCAMS,Most poor criminals spend that amount of time waiting for trial to begin.
SCAMS,"Isn't that what usually happens after someone finishes their sentence? This really just seems like a ""let's see if this gets people pissed off"" article."
SCAMS,"I *still* don‚Äôt get what the deal was here.

Is the issue that she/they didn‚Äôt bribe the school directly like many do for Ivy League schools?  Is the university mad she didn‚Äôt put a down payment on their new football field for them?"
SCAMS,"im still not bothered by what she did.

Im more bothered by the schools that let it happen."
SCAMS,Punishment should have been to pay the way for some low income people to attend. Just have her take care of their fees. Why is this not the punishment?
SCAMS,"I can‚Äôt believe how many people think she should‚Äôve gotten a longer prison sentence. She‚Äôs not a danger to society. 

Instead of advocating for privilged people to get fucked by the system like poor people, maybe we should instead make it fair for everyone."
SCAMS,That's enough for a cameo on Get Hard part 2 with Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell.
SCAMS,I‚Äôm still so genuinely confused by this entire situation. I thought we all knew that rich people buy their way into things. I‚Äôm just really confused by the backlash and even legal repercussions of this situation.
SCAMS,"Sure it may be unfair that rich people nonviolent crime gets punished less than poor people nonviolent crime. But the answer isn't to sentence Aunt Becky harshly, it's to sentence nonviolent drug crimes properly."
SCAMS,"As fucked up as this all is, I feel we use prison for all the wrong reasons in America. Bitch bribed schools to cheat her daughters way in, she didn‚Äôt kill anyone. Idk probably gonna get downvoted but this doesn‚Äôt seem prison worthy."
SCAMS,">convicted for 2 years; out in 2 months.

Sure is nice being rich and beyond justice."
SCAMS,Which is it reddit? Do you want people imprisoned for non violent crimes or not?
SCAMS,Next season on 60 Days in!!!
SCAMS,It wasn't prison. It was jail. There is a difference.
SCAMS,It was a hard 8 weeks at the prison spa.
SCAMS,If you have connections and money you serve  10% of your sentence and are released standard Procedure
SCAMS,Her daughter is too dumb to get accepted into college the normal way.
SCAMS,Two justice systems
SCAMS,Never got this witch hunt. This issue is widespread. A complete cancer on the admissions process that is not unique to this case nor university. It‚Äôs a steep public penalty to precisely 1 (metaphorically) of the thousands of participants.
SCAMS,She didnt learn shit and her daughters are still assholes.
SCAMS,"A lot of misinformation in this thread, I'm guessing in a mix from people not knowing exactly what happened and people injecting their own emotions/biases.

These are the facts per [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lori_Loughlin#2019_college_admissions_bribery_scandal):

* Lori Loughlin and her husband, along with 50 other people, were caught in a college admissions scandal investigated by the FBI. 

* The couple paid $500,000 to Key Worldwide Foundation.

* Key Worldwide Foundation used different tactics for different prospective students to help them secure admission. In some cases they faked SAT scores, in some cases they bribed admissions officials, and in some cases they claimed a student would participate in a sport they never had or never would.

* In the case of the Loughlin's children, Key Worldwide falsified information so that USC (University of Southern California) would be led to believe that their daughter would join the school's women's rowing team even though neither child had a background in this nor any intention to do so. 

* As a result of the allegations, Loughlin was released from *Fuller House*, was edited out of the show *When Calls the Heart* (Hallmark channel show), and HP removed her from their ads. 

* She plead guilty to wire/mail fraud and was charged to 2 months in jail.

* She served the required 2 months in jail and is now released."
SCAMS,"CMV: prison should be used only for people that would be a threat to others if they were not locked up (i.e. rapists, murderers, any violent crime) and not shit like this. house arrest would be more than adequate, and a huge fine would be an even better punishment than that."
SCAMS,Shouldn‚Äôt more people be mad at the university for letting people like Olivia in?
SCAMS,Any of us would have been locked up for at least 2 years
SCAMS,Rich people cheating their way through life? Mindblown.
SCAMS,Was bullshit she was sent there in the first place given all the other worse shit people get away with
SCAMS,I don't understand why the daughter didn't get into any trouble at all. She signed her name on all of the stuff she knew was fake. Arent college applications legal documents?
SCAMS,White rich people can get away with anything
SCAMS,"I wonder why she got 2 months while her husband got 5?

Was he more culpable than she was (seems unlikely since they both have said they knew what they were doing), or is this just another example of the courts arbitrarily giving more lenient sentences to women?"
SCAMS,"Play with millions, get a slap on the wrist. Sell a $20 sack of weed, FUCKING LIFE!"
SCAMS,[deleted]
SCAMS,Next stop: MIT
SCAMS,I think we all knew this wouldn‚Äôt last long
SCAMS,"Oh, that's cool. There's still thousands of people in jail for non violent drug crimes that'll be there for the rest of their lives, but I'm glad aunt Becky got a fair sentencing"
SCAMS,Her husband looks like some kind of doll robot.
SCAMS,Did any of the school administrators do any jail time? They‚Äôre the most egregious people in this whole ordeal.
SCAMS,Imagine blowing all that money just for your kids to drop out and be influencers
SCAMS,"Everybody: ""oh that's just long enough to blah blah blah""

Also them: not a damn idea what the inside of prison actually looks like."
SCAMS,And the corrupt asshats that run the college??? Any punishment for them?
SCAMS,Did any of the administrators and USC employees that took the bribes go to jail??
SCAMS,"Americans love to incarcerate other Americans for just about anything. Possession of marijuana, loitering, jaywalking and scamming your way to getting your daughter into college. Huge fines would have been way more effective than sending these people to jail. It  cost taxpayers more money in court fees and incarceration costs to put them behind bars."
SCAMS,"2 months, that‚Äôs it? It took way longer to try and sentence them. Seems like they are getting off easy considering how big a deal this was."
SCAMS,Meanwhile there are people serving 30 years for a gram of weed
SCAMS,"Imagine having a superficial little twit as your kid, and then you end up going to jail for them. That must suck."
SCAMS,Was not fucking long enough.These people are why college tuition costs are obscene.
SCAMS,"Reddit: jails don‚Äôt work 

Reddit: she got out too early"
SCAMS,">	""I am truly, profoundly and deeply sorry,"" she said. 

Yeah, sorry she got caught."
SCAMS,I just can't understand what they thought they'd accomplish long term if their daughters are too dumb to get into USC (not knocking USC.. but 500k?)  Buy them each a house and send them to community college..
SCAMS,"$500,000 to get her kids into uni!? They must have been dumb as shit if this was cheaper than tuition."
SCAMS,"Wow all of two months at club Fed. 

‚ÄúLook a lots changed since you went in...‚Äù"
SCAMS,"She paid her fine. She got out on good behavior. Time for the parole. Lori already lost every job she had as a working actor, and she likely won't be getting them back. Her Hallmark contract is null and void. Fuller House wrapped over a year ago. She ruined her own family and future."
SCAMS,"As George Carlin used to say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big club, and you ain‚Äôt in it‚Äù"
SCAMS,"....2 months ago? 

Two? Months?? 

2020 what the FUCK"
SCAMS,"Wow,...two whole months....she looks so beat down. How can she ever recover?"
SCAMS,"I just need to ask, who the fuck cares? Why is this and other stories about celebrities fucking news? It is just so stupid."
SCAMS,This is so weird that parents would get jailed over this.
SCAMS,What's that? A rich person who will never have to apply for a job was just released from a place where she got free food and housing for two months?
SCAMS,"Good, she should have never been to jail. Universities just got mad that she paid someone else instead of the university to buy her daughters way in. Its all a scam, she just paid a different scammer. Meanwhile the textbook dickheads are still benefitting."
SCAMS,"While both ""punishments"" are laughable at best (the money they were fined is just a drop in a bucket for them) and the ""prison"" terms are a joke.

Also, why is the male (her husband) given around 2-2.5x the punishment for the same crime?

Female: 2 months, $150,000, 2 year supervised release, 100 hours community service

Male: 5 months, $250,000, 2 years supervised release, 250 hours community service

This whole thing is a joke where neither of them is actually punished for their crimes."
SCAMS,WHO GIVES A FUCK. Trump just pardoned kushners scum bag father.
SCAMS,"Didn't Dr Dre just buy a building to get his daughter into USC? Seems like Lori Loughlan's real crime is only being kinda rich, not ""donate $70 million"" rich.  She has more in common with the average redditor than she does with Dr Dre."
SCAMS,"we spent so much time, effort, and money just to jail her for 2 months...our legal system is an absolute joke.

Systematic fraud?  60 days  


an ounce of weed?  60 years"
SCAMS,Prepare for YouTube and Netflix documentaries that ‚Äúprove‚Äù she isn‚Äôt guilty.
SCAMS,Did she come out with a tear drop tattoo by her eye?
SCAMS,How are we gonna walk down the street safely now?
SCAMS,See people bitching here about how short the prison sentence is. You have two options. Elect the right official who actually care about this country or be the 1%
SCAMS,"If you HAD to go to prison, 2020 seems like the right time to do it."
SCAMS,Rad
SCAMS,Did she get any tattoos? How is she going to find a good job with this on her record?  Can she vote?
SCAMS,Shocked face
SCAMS,"I wonder how many ‚Äúelites‚Äù have dumb dumb kids that they buy degrees for, shit, how many bought one for themselves too."
SCAMS,College admissions are a massive scam regardless. Feels like a waste of tax dollars all around.
SCAMS,Too bad she didn't strut around a state capitol with a gun.  That's 100% OK.
SCAMS,Rad.
SCAMS,I bet that wasn‚Äôt very rad.
The Legend of White Snake,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
The Legend of White Snake,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
The Legend of White Snake,Anime Watchers: What gap??
The Legend of White Snake,"Absolutely love this show, it‚Äôs just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
The Legend of White Snake,Undone was the shit
The Legend of White Snake,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
The Legend of White Snake,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
The Legend of White Snake,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
The Legend of White Snake,"It‚Äôs ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be ‚Äúadult‚Äù with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
The Legend of White Snake,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
The Legend of White Snake,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
The Legend of White Snake,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
The Legend of White Snake,"Easily one of the best animated shows I‚Äôve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It‚Äôs amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
The Legend of White Snake,Huge gap??
The Legend of White Snake,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
The Legend of White Snake,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
The Legend of White Snake,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
The Legend of White Snake,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
The Legend of White Snake,"It is‚Ä¶ okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn‚Äôt call it bad, but I really can‚Äôt suggest it to anyone who isn‚Äôt a fan of the stream."
The Legend of White Snake,This show is so amazing
The Legend of White Snake,I had no idea that it was based on a D&D campaign. The table to screen compilations are üî•üî•üî•
The Legend of White Snake,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
The Legend of White Snake,What gap ?
The Legend of White Snake,So many better shows than vox.
The Legend of White Snake,"I dont know if I've just only seen shitty scenes from it, but the dialog is increadibly cringe in that show."
The Legend of White Snake,"Just finished season 2. Would highly recommend.

It's got great voice acting, great art and superb story.

Can't wait for season 3."
The Legend of White Snake,Second season is even better than the first one.
The Legend of White Snake,"Such a fun show, I hope it has a nice long run great really funny and a great fantasy show"

The Legend of White Snake,"It‚Äôs genuinely just a fun show. Saw S1 when I had no real idea what Critical Role was, and was only vaguely aware of what DnD itself was or how it worked, but still enjoyed it a lot. 

Didn‚Äôt care much for the humor early on, especially in the first couple episodes- it actually reminded me a lot of the first couple episodes of Harley Quinn in how it just front loaded as much profanity, gore and sex jokes as possible. But it balances out over S1 and Season 2‚Äôs humor is, while still raunchy at times, far better balanced the same way Harley evened out. 

It‚Äôs definitely not a straight up grimly beautiful drama like Arcane. But its heavy enough to have substance while never being outright dour. It reminds me a lot of older scifi/fantasy adventure shows like Stargate, Farscape or Xena in how it has its heavier moments but there never stops being an underlying feeling of fun to it all, like it never takes itself too seriously. The kind of thing you put on and just have a good time with. 


I‚Äôd easily put it on par with later Castlevania seasons. Not as good as that shows first Dracula arc, but better than the subsequent ones. Vox Machina also seems to improve with every new batch of episodes as well. 

Id say its worth checking out for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and particularly found family stories, but isnt strictly looking for a pure drama."
The Legend of White Snake,Just finished season 2 last night. It's a good show.
The Legend of White Snake,"I enjoy the show to an extent but I feel like it is fueled by tropes and stereotypes. When an epsidoe begins, you almost immediately will know how it will end. I also hate how death is nothing in this show. And the modern spin coating everything is tiresome. I mean jesus... Grog is now just ""god of war"" but weaker and dumber. 

Amazon is afraid to get really creative. They play it too safe even in their great tv shows like The Boys or The Expanse."
The Legend of White Snake,"As far as original shows go, it's certainly up there as a fantastic addition to streaming shows. Definitely one I didn't expect to enjoy as much after so many other stinkers."
The Legend of White Snake,In the American view of the animation world.... Jesus.
The Legend of White Snake,"I‚Äôm really enjoying Vox Machina, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúfilling a huge gap‚Äù when there are tons of Japanese anime shows right now that honestly blow US cartoons out of the water.

Modern Western cartoon is honestly bare bone when it comes to finding good shows that isn‚Äôt shitty adult comedy/ Rick and Morty clones. They just never want to branch out to different genres and keep doing the same stuff over and over again. It‚Äôs either comedy or fantasy action, that‚Äôs it."
The Legend of White Snake,Best show of the year so far
The Legend of White Snake,"This show is actually very mediocre.

if ""ehh"" was an animated TV show, this would be it"
The Legend of White Snake,"To it‚Äôs credit I did finish the 1st season, but I just felt like it was so corny. Like I want American FMA, HxH, Monster, Berserk‚Ä¶ not this."
The Legend of White Snake,"Pantheon 

Primal

Invincible

Castlevania 

*gestures vaguely at anime*"
The Legend of White Snake,Arcane is amazing.
The Legend of White Snake,Bruh how can this be adult animation with no comedic gore or gross humor
The Legend of White Snake,I completely agree with the author! I love animated sci-fi and fantasy but typically these stories star teens. Matter of fact my husband has started teasing me about watching high schoolers save the world. It is not my fault that most things that fall into this category follows teenage protagonists. Things like Vox Machina and Lower Decks are a breath of fresh air for me! I get my animated sci-fi/fantasy with adult protagonists that I can identify with more and not so much of the goofy ridiculousness as you would find in things like Family Guy and Rick and Morty. I hope more stories like these start coming out cause I am here for it!
The Legend of White Snake,"Vox is fun. That means a lot. Doesn't take itself seriously. Action, comedy, adventure, absurd musical numbers, and fisting jokes. Perfect TV"
The Legend of White Snake,What‚Äôs the show about?
The Legend of White Snake,"I really hope culture changes enough in the next years so that people don't write embarrassing shit like this anymore. ""Saving a fantastical world with the power of friendship isn‚Äôt just for kids."" *Yes, it is.*"
The Legend of White Snake,Primal was fucking great too
The Legend of White Snake,Don't forget Castlevania. I'm excited about that sequel series they revealed.
The Legend of White Snake,"Those are coming-of-age stories with teenage protagonists, which is precisely what the author of the article *isnt* referring to in the title. 

VM is ""special"" because it has a cast of adult characters with adult humor going around fantasy land and saving everyone. Most shows with a similar premise tend to feature, like I mentioned, teenage casts and coming-of-age stories. Castlevania is the big exception, but it ofc has a very different tone to VM."
The Legend of White Snake,PANTHEON!! Totally got screwed by it‚Äôs platform. If it was on a bigger/more accessible service that shit would have blown up.
The Legend of White Snake,Then on top of those two you also have Dota: Dragon's Blood and Dragon Age: Absolution over at Netflix. I guess Arcane is more YA than adult aimed but it is definitely serialised fantasy in animation.
The Legend of White Snake,[deleted]
The Legend of White Snake,"They didn‚Äôt pay for an article, fuck em."
The Legend of White Snake,And Pantheon got cancelled despite being awesome.
The Legend of White Snake,RIP Pantheon.
The Legend of White Snake,Arcane?
The Legend of White Snake,"The author is an idiot, but this comment is hilarious because it's the most upvoted and yet dumbs down the conversation so much. Now we have to take a step back and explain to this smug poster what ""coming of age"" means"
The Legend of White Snake,Don‚Äôt forget King of the Hill
The Legend of White Snake,"I feel like you should read the article, the author has seen those shows:

> The Legend of Vox Machina is not the first of these shows, but it is the one that made me realize just how wide the gap between Steven Universe and Rick and Morty is."
The Legend of White Snake,"to be fair she said ""fantasy animation by adults for adults"" while invincible is a superhero show and pantheon is science fiction."
The Legend of White Snake,Also that they're working on Mighty Nein as well.
The Legend of White Snake,"Critical Role gets a lot of love, and rightly so, but the space for actual play D&D style games has really blossomed ( partly because of CR).

My personal favorite is dimension 20 -- relatively high production values and a cast with a comedy background.

So if people want more of that sort of story telling and are willing to take a chance on medium, check out a few actual play shows and see if one tickles your fancy"
The Legend of White Snake,They really have started to create harry potter levels of empire.
The Legend of White Snake,"To be fair the article does touch on that, even though a lot of anime is more willing to be mature a huge chunk of the mainstream ones are ultmately still coming of age stories about children, and a lot of these are still definitely aimed at children, we're just able to enjoy it too. One example I think about is how both Naruto and Ben 10 gradually aged up the cast, and once the cast got old enough instead of making a show about the adult cast they just reset to being about kids. 

Which isnt to say there's nothing like that in anime, I havent started new Trigun but old Trigun was definitely in that niche of action based fantasy/sci fi story about friendship. There is a lot if you search for it though I suspect the average anime fan just watches the most popular shows to come out each year like cartoon fans do. I also feel like a lot of mature anime about adults ends up not being action at all, Oddtaxi was amazing but I dont know if I'd say its comparable to The Owl House."
The Legend of White Snake,"It seems like no one in this thread has actually read the article. The article is specifically talking about how VM is unique by being a high fantasy adventure comprised entirely of adult characters with no coming-of-age plotlines.

There are bound to be *some* animes that do fit that bill, but most anime fans will agree that the vast majority (especially the most popular) don't. Some fantasy seinen have mostly adult protagonists and themes, but almost always also have extremely dark tones and settings that Vox Machina avoids. They also rarely get any attention in the west, which is dominated by shounen."
The Legend of White Snake,"The gap of non-ecchi anime.

I know some people can accept sexualized anime, but most of it is trash and feels very pedo. Girls who look childish but are ‚Äúhundred year old demons‚Äù or whatever is fucking gross.

Even Your Name, brilliant until the end, all of a sudden up skirt shot at the end ‚Äúbut it was a boy in a girls body.‚Äù Fucking pervs."
The Legend of White Snake,Shows that don‚Äôt have characters that need to go on internal monologues about how they need to be stronger and have more willpower for a decent 20% of the show‚Äôs total runtime in the voice registry of a 7 year old boy
The Legend of White Snake,Cartoons
The Legend of White Snake,"Agree, the fight scenes are epic, especially the ones in the S2 premiere and the last three eps.  I really liked the character arcs for Vax, Grog, and Scanlan this season, too.  They are all great voice actors, especially the guy who plays Scanlan.  His musical numbers are always so much fun.  He is a terrific singer!"
The Legend of White Snake,"A shame the entire underdark got skipped, i liked the dwarf city and the party ""friend"" they picked up. Guess they didn't want more stuff with the dragonborn sorcerer"
The Legend of White Snake,"For sure, but rotoscope is kind of on the edge‚Ä¶"
The Legend of White Snake,"The moment that really really sold me on the show was in episode 3 when >!Percy had a panic attack after seeing the Briarwoods and the whole crew came together, no jokes, no banter, and asked what they can do to help him. 
I was a little worried the show was gonna be a bunch of troppy assholes arguing the whole show, and had already written off Grog and Percy as 1-note, but that moment made me fall in love with the whole team. Percy and Vex are fucking adorable together!<"
The Legend of White Snake,"I just wish they'd do a bit more show don't tell.

The last few episodes were at some points kind of ridiculous when it comes to flashbacks during pivotal character moments. You'd have long flashbacks to scenes that happened only one or two episodes ago."
The Legend of White Snake,"Yeah, they did it their way. There aren‚Äôt corpo shills telling them, ‚Äúno, we can‚Äôt have Scanlan sing about anal beads or masturbation.‚Äù They gleefully and accurately translate the spirit of that game into the cartoon. =)"
The Legend of White Snake,"See I‚Äôve never watched/listened to Critical Role either, but I loved the first season! I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be groundbreaking or anything, just wanted to have a fun experience and that‚Äôs exactly what it delivered."
The Legend of White Snake,"Did you really just compare the animation to invincible?? Where they literally had some of the hero‚Äôs moving through still shots? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I liked the show, but vox machinas animation was MUCH better than invincible; which was clearly rushed."
The Legend of White Snake,"Speaking as a fan of CR, the first season of Legends of Vox Machina mildly sucked, especially compared to other adult animated shows, like Invincible and Arcane.

The second season is much better.  Sadly, I don't think very many people are going to get through the first season with any impetus to watch on."
The Legend of White Snake,"okay there's not much that can compare to Arcane, that's an unfair expectation"
The Legend of White Snake,"I finished the second season. The show feels like it was written for CR fans, and no one else. The show starts with an already established group with characters in the middle of their own characters arcs. The second season is better, only for the fact the characters are a little more established. Otherwise,  you're correct, you have no reason to care about any of the characters"
The Legend of White Snake,This is true the animation isnt great
The Legend of White Snake,"It's essentially just a show based on scripted RP. No matter how vehemently the fan base screams that it's all organic you can definitely tell they've been workshopping their material with each other and coming with up bits to do together. It's scripted, workshopped, rewritten, and practiced. Both CR and the show by extension get a lot of leeway with various aspects of their performance because it's all supposed to be made up on the spot and you can tell it's just not. That's not a deal breaker for a lot people but it is for others. 

It's very average and pretty derivative (ie they have a character whose entire concept is ""Sokka but he gets laid"")."
The Legend of White Snake,I feel like season one was kinda meh but season two is considerably better because it actually has character development for everyone.
The Legend of White Snake,I must have been sick or something the week I watched Arcane.  Do not understand the hype at all.
The Legend of White Snake,"I am pretty sure the source material had even more, just more improvised"
The Legend of White Snake,Most scenes with that unfunny gnome make me want to drop the series.
The Legend of White Snake,"Surprisingly the music is really fucking good too, Adds lots of point sin my book"
The Legend of White Snake,"I tried getting into the show recently myself and I pretty much agree with that. Though I thought their horny for everyone thing was just them making fun of the decades old trope of every d&d campaign always having at least one guy that tries to sleep with everyone and everything and use charm for everything  (which in my gaming in middle and high school was certainly on point). 

But yeah the show overall reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons from the 90s. Not the good ones, but the stuff like Captain planet. I would definitely say we need more animation like that today. It's definitely not anime and its not adult animation, it's more like the older cartoons and that's pretty cool tbh.

Also I haven't read the article fwiw."
The Legend of White Snake,">My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

A lot of this is down to the source material being a D&D game. Because... yeah, nearly every big fight, at least one character was on the verge of death. If that wasn't the case, the game wouldn't have been fun to play. Additionally, >!they *did* kill a character this season - but of course, she was resurrected, because that's something that can happen in D&D.!<

They could definitely work on being more creative with the stakes, but when you have a character in the party that can literally magically heal just about any wound/injury, the stakes do have to be pretty high for there to be any tension."
The Legend of White Snake,"eh, Legend of Vox Machina season 1 was funded by kickstarter, and Amazon came in 2019 to boost the season 1 funding and give the second season. Invincible released in 2021 - while LoVM release was delayed to 2022 - but LoVM could go straight into production for season 2 with no downtime once the writers etc were done with their portions for season 1."
The Legend of White Snake,"Personal opinion, animated superhero shows aren't something new, we have tons of them.

Not interested in invincible because it's too violent for my taste.

But a medieval fantasy animated show? We have way less of those. The ones I remember now are DOTA, the Witcher animated movie, castlevania and dragon age absolution. And I loved all of those.

Also I love toilet humor, what can I say. I might be 40, but my friends and I still joke with that. So it's nice and refreshing when most adult cartoons in that style are a bit overly doom and gloom."
The Legend of White Snake,"Let‚Äôs be real Amazon has the money to produce both at once, it was probably more a matter of choice considering how well received Invincible was and scheduling conflicts. I know Seth Rogan is a minor VA in it, and I think he also participates in writing and directing. I think it‚Äôs the same thing for The Boys. When Amazon has a banger of a show they typically know to keep it going and how to do so successfully despite some of the shitty adaptations. 

I mean didn‚Äôt The Expanse get picked up and flooded with cash because it‚Äôs a book Bezos enjoys? They do have big IPs they‚Äôve made flop, so they aren‚Äôt even close to infallible, but they seem to do well with the content they manage to get roots in the ground for."
The Legend of White Snake,"yikes, you must be never see damn thing else then. poor soul"
The Legend of White Snake,"I know it doesnt bother some anime fans but sexualizing little girls is a big turnoff for most people not desensitized to it through years of anime watching. Its why anime like Attack on Titan and Demon Slayer break through to mainstream pop culture once in awhile; but the larger volume of series with names like ""my little sister is sexually frustrating me"" get ignored"
The Legend of White Snake,"Yeah  
he's crying ""oh, we finally have a adult animated show""  
Wait, do you think stuff like Black Lagoon are for children ???  
Fuck, i am 45, and i still have a hard time watching the twins arc"
The Legend of White Snake,I mean anime is almost as bad as cartoons are in terms of the good:trash ratio.
The Legend of White Snake,I know who critical role are but I've never seen anything from them. I loved the show.
The Last Czars,I wonder who will be my boi Rasputin 
The Last Czars,I love this. It's such a piece of interesting history and it needed a big budget adaptation. 
The Last Czars,"If this even touches the quality of The Crown, I am so into this already."
The Last Czars,[deleted]
The Last Czars,"Last time I checked, we already have a great documentary about the fall of the Ronanov dynasty...

""Anastasia"" anyone?"
The Last Czars,"There needs to be an episode where a scullery maid for the Romanov family steals a bear-clock and absconds to America, where she descends to a life of prostitution. Eventually the bear-clock gets passed down through generations until it falls into the hands of a young Martin Crane."
The Last Czars,Spoiler alert: they all die. 
The Last Czars,">  It will be a mix of documentary and reconstruction

Crap, that rarely work well as a format. I wish they would make it like The Crown."
The Last Czars,Are we going to have any mention of Stalin robbing banks for the Bolsheviks? How many speeches will we see Lenin give? What about the formation of the Red Army? This has the potential to be fucking great.
The Last Czars,Woah! This would be pretty interesting
The Last Czars,"Probably to compete with Amazon's upcoming Russian show, ""the Romanoffs"""
The Last Czars,At least it's not another El chapo series
The Last Czars,Please get Leonardo Dicaprio to play Lenin.
The Last Czars,"This has a pretty high chance of creating a shit ton of controversy, or of being absolute shit. My money is on controversy.

Russia has recently gone insane with their Nicholas II worship led by, of all people, the cute Crimean female prosecutor that had weird anime pictures following a few years ago. A recent Russian movie about Nicholas‚Äôs affair with a ballet dancer was nearly banned, theaters were firebombed, and tons and tons of shit about it dominated the news. The director was nearly ran out of the country.

All because Nicholas II has been made a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church. So anything showing him as less than saintly ‚Äúoffends the feelings of the faithful‚Äù, which is legally a crime in the Russian federation."
The Last Czars,"I hope it‚Äôs not Downton Abbey, the Russian oligarch version."
The Last Czars,"I hope they don‚Äôt go out of their way to romanticize the Tsar. He was a bloody, yet highly incompetent and easily influenced ruler, who welcomed and indirectly encouraged pogroms, used army units to fire on peaceful demonstrations, and was in no small part responsible for WWI (and everything that followed).  It‚Äôs a shame about his family - but he got what he deserved."
The Last Czars,"Interesting that it's supposed to air in 2018.  Pretty quick for just hearing about it!  
That link also mentioned a show coming to BBC called Civisilations which [""tells the story of art from the dawn of human history to the present day, for the first time on a global scale.""](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/civilisations)  Seems like it could either be extremely interesting, or extremely boring.  Hoping for the former, and if it's the latter I'm sure there's enough adderall to make it the most interesting thing in the world to me."
The Last Czars,Announced on the 100 anniversary of the Russian Revolution. 
The Last Czars,I just saw the film Nicholas and Alexandra a few weeks ago and it really stuck with me. How a Royal family could crumble so quickly. 
The Last Czars,I just finished an amazing podcast about WWI that spent some time on this subject and it was really fascinating.  Should make a good drama.
The Last Czars,"Whenever I read the phrase ""Netflix orders..."" I always picture Netflix in like a bathrobe, getting pay-per-view in its hotel suite, and then letting us watch it after it's through with it. "
The Last Czars,"BBC did this 40 years ago for all 3 monarchies, called ""Fall of Eagles.""

You can watch it on YouTube, and Patrick Stewart makes a seriously convincing Lenin."
The Last Czars,We need more Russian and Asian history on TV. This sounds awesome. 
The Last Czars,I literally just watched the 3 part doc about the fall of the Romanov's last week. The one with Lucy Woorsly on Netflix. Don't really know much about Russia's History but the fall of Romanov's/Rise of the Bolshevik is still an important part of World History. Really looking forward to this.
The Last Czars,"Didn't they already do a documentary series on Romanovs recently?

It's probably up there as one of the best historical TV docs. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USUA_1WVM8I)."
The Last Czars,"This sounds really interesting and cool.  Look forward to watching.  Netflix is airing a series in January that also looks interesting - Babylon Berlin.  It's a crime show taking place in 1920's Berlin.  Sex, drugs and rising Nazis."
The Last Czars,Wish HBO would do this instead.  
The Last Czars,If it's done in a similar style to The Crown then I'm all-in
The Last Czars,When executed well (no pun intended) this could be freaking epic.
The Last Czars,"The way I'd do this is to have one story, the story of Lenin, paralleling the story of Tsar Nicholas. You'd cut back and forth between their lives, our protagonist and our antagonist never coming face-to-face. You'd juxtapose Lenin's squalid life relative to Nicholas' opulent life style, one character would come to represent the angry, poor Russians, whereas the other would come to represent the aloof, disconnected oligarchy. The series would have an air of urgency, like we are counting down to doomsday while we watch all of these characters who are totally unaware of what is about to happen. Since Lenin's brother Ulyanov  tried to assassinate Alexander III and ultimately he was executed for it, we'd start with a flash back where we see Lenin and his brother talking, establishing their relationship and establishing Lenin's motivations. Simultaneously we are cutting back and forth in the life of Czar Nicholas, seeing how his character experienced the same events. While Nicholas enjoyed parties and a lavish lifestyle, Lenin lost his brother and everything important to him, and so we understand his motivation."
The Last Czars, Guess I'm not the only one who clicked on that Empire of the Tsars documentary they have. 
The Last Czars,"""Documentary"", yeah. If it will be not antisoviet, i will be very surprised."
The Last Czars,"Se caliginosa e sordida giace l'ombra sugli Urali

The Last Czars,"I can‚Äôt wait to see how they portray Nicky - I‚Äôm guessing a bafoon in way over his skis that is a phenomenal family man.  It‚Äôll probably require quite a bit of complexity.  Plus Alexandra‚Äôs perception/treatment by the Russian nobility and peasants.

And obviously Rasputin will become a fan favorite."
The Last Czars,"In the dark of the night, I will binge watch this"
The Last Czars,"I'm a simple man.  I see Netflix and the Romanovs in the same sentence, I upvote."
The Last Czars,"Id rather them do a drama series called ""The Russian Revolution"" so we could get the full picture rather than ""poor Tsars got killed""."
The Last Czars,[deleted]
The Last Czars,Cool! I'll definitely watch that
The Last Czars,I honestly really want to see this. 
The Last Czars,Would watch. High expectations for location/set and wardrobe authenticity. 
The Last Czars,Tsar*
The Last Czars,"spoiler, they all die. communism takes over. "
The Last Czars,"Before this announcement: *What the fuck?! Price increase?! I couldn't possibly care less about original content!*

The history fanatic reading this announcement: *Psh, I ain't even mad, dawg.*"
The Last Czars,Really excited for this. Will they be sticking mostly to fact or will they go down the magic Rasputin and Anastasia surviving lines?
The Last Czars,They should get Robert K Massie as a consulting producer. Then also do a series on his books Dreadnought and Castles of Steel 
The Last Czars,Im sure it will be filled with hilarious stereotypes.
The Last Czars,Wasn't there a thread a few months back about things that would be cool on tv and this was one of the ideas?  
The Last Czars,Good choice Netflix 
The Last Czars,I love love LOVE the rise of historical series in recent years!
The Last Czars,"What they need is a low budget occupational comedy like 30rock, the Office, scrubs, IASIF, or parks and rec. "
The Last Czars,I hope it shows how totally brutal they were towards the people. 
The Last Czars,I get the feeling they‚Äôll do the same thing that they did with their previous documentary relating to the fall of the Romanov Dynasty. 
The Last Czars,Can they throw in a plucky talking animal for the kids? I don't know I'm thinking maybe a bat?
The Last Czars,"It would be great if they would do a thorough background check on all the principal players so they can avoid hiring any pedophiles or other freaking monsters.  That way they would avoid enriching the predators as well as  risking another sudden cancellation, and I wouldn't risk becoming a huge fan of someone's work only to find out later that I had been rooting for a monster all along."
The Last Czars,I hope they verify that no one has any sexual misconduct issues. 
The Last Czars,[deleted]
The Last Czars,"If this could lead into a series about the rise of the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin I think you could see some of the most interesting television ever made.

I don't think I've heard of a contemporary drama which really portrays the crazy fucking revolution and alien social landscape of the world's first communist nation. "
The Last Czars,Needs Kelsey Grammer. Frasier fans will get it.
The Last Czars,"As an American who doesn‚Äôt know a damned thing about Russian history but is legitimately interested and has 0 motivation to find answers in the meantime, I love this. "
The Last Czars,I‚Äôm loving all the historic dramas we‚Äôre getting on Netflix. 
The Last Czars,Ohh this should be good as long it‚Äôs House of cards season 1-2 meets Downton Abbey in Russia
The Last Czars,The last BARON!
The Last Czars,So dank. Actual history programming in the wake of History Channel‚Äôs failures.
The Last Czars,"I'm hoping this won't become a ""The Romanov Dynasty did nothing wrong"" sort of documentary."
The Last Czars,"This will be fascinating, I lived in Perm, Russia where a few of the family members were assassinated by the White Army. I've been interested in learning more about them since living there but haven't found the time to read much yet, this will be very good!  

Another interesting tidbit about Perm if anyone is interested, it is the town that inspired the fictional village of Yuryatin in Dr. Zhivago and most people have never heard of Perm"
The Last Czars,nyetflix
The Last Czars,They should call it The Fault in our Czars
The Last Czars,"Maybe they can keep it going for a little bit longer than Marco Polo.

(Am I in danger of being downvoted for saying that I really liked Marco Polo?)"
The Last Czars,Yaaasssssssss
The Last Czars,I saw a documentary where they found the czars families bodies and did forensic analysis.  Apparently their teeth were in pretty bad shape which contrasts with the extravagant clothes and lifestyle they had.  Its like a metaphor for the veneer of wealth and power covering up the rot and disorder Russia was.
The Last Czars,They should have called it Dancing With The Czars
The Last Czars,"What is the fucking obsession in pop-history with the ""LAST SOMETHING"", they are usually least interesting. 

I'd argue that the story of Peter the Great or Catherine The Great are much more interesting and entertaining. "
The Last Czars,"Knowing that it's Hollywood, they will likely whitewash the identity of the murderers."
The Last Czars,I for one am glad the Bolsheviks killed off the Romanov Dynasty.
The Last Czars,Soundtrack by Mastodon plz and ty.

The Last Czars,Great news!  I loved reading Nicholas and Alexandra.  The ERB with Rasputin is pretty sweet too. 
The Last Czars,In the last year I've been reading a lot of fiction surrounding the revolution and it only just struck me the other day that the 100th anniversary is near by.   Probably explains the sudden amount of interest in all things Soviet.
The Last Czars,"I feel like Netflix is throwing a lot of shit at the wall just to see what sticks and unfortunately, it's usually more disappointing than it is enjoyable, for me at least."
The Last Czars,I love this trend for historical dramas.

The Last Czars,Who will play Lenin?

For anyone interested in an accessable read on this whole thing though, I really recommend ""The Romanovs: The Final Chapter"" by Robert K. Massie. Knowing how it all ends will make it break your heart in places."

Horses prance through a silver storm

Figures dancing gracefully

Across my memory

Long ago

Far away

Glowing dim as an ember

Things my heart used to know

Things it yearns to remember

.

And a song

Someone sings

Once upon a December.

Bangkok Love Stories: Plead,"I have quite a few throughout my years of watching TV shows, but my overall favourite would have to be Naomi and Emily from Skins, season 3 - 7.

They're undeniably one of the greatest relationship stories coming out of Skins. Even if you were to separate all the Naomily-related scenes from everything else in the series, it'd still make a fantastic romance movie/miniseries, one that's well-developed, taking us through flowery heart-warming days to gloomy and heart-breaking ones. It starts out as a cheesy and maybe even clich√© '*gay girl have crush on straight girl*' plot, but I think what made this one work from the get-go is that the series established that these 2 already had some 'awkward history' before the point where they see them first. Obviously the inevitable happens, but the subtle intricacy I think most viewers might not have noticed with Naomi and Emily is how both girls used each other as bridges to 'get away' from their complicated home lives. With Emily being seen as nothing more than her sister's shadow by her family who doesn't accept her for who she is, and Naomi whose mother comes and goes as she pleases and seemingly doesn't care about what Naomi wants, both girls were able to find themselves with each other.

Both Naomi and Emily's character development were done within the bounds of their relationship, and it is quite impressive when you see how much they changed throughout the series. A great relationship doesn't come without relationship drama though, so by the end of their story they'd gone through tender, heartbreaking, gut-wrenching, sweet, emotional and even sadder moments. Everything was executed perfectly; from their lustrous and tender lake scene, to the dark and gloomy tone of Emily's monologue on the edge of that rooftop, to Naomi's touching confession of love at the end of their school days, to the very poignant hospital scene where one girl is devastated about possibly having to see the love of her life for the final time, while the other feels the same about breaking her heart again."

So during a standard body-swap episode they do the obvious thing everyone would do in a body of the opposite gender, and decide they quite like each other. They have a relationship (mostly based on sex) which doesn't get a lot of attention, until Chiana decides to sleep with D'Argo's son (for unknown reasons).

Takes them probably over a season to start getting back together (I can't even recall when it happened), but in the end Chiana is pretty distraught at D'Argo's death.

Just seemed like a good ""background"" relationship to me."

\>20. The themes, ‚ÄúIf you kill them, you‚Äôre no better than them‚Äù 

Oh hell yeah. Especially when not killing them is sometimes much worse. Like if they can't be captured or detained reliably and can be expected to kill more people.

My own ones are

A-Team Firing. Bullets are flying everything at fairly close ranges, but no one is getting hit, or at least none of the named characters. Also when the heroes are being strafed by a chopper or plane and the bullets follow a path to their left and right. And car chases where the hero's car has absorbed its own weight in bullets but no occupants or critical components were hit.

Melee where the fighters are happily trading punches, but as soon as one of them picks up a knife or sword, the other fighter gains a 100% dodge buff.

World-ending stakes. If you set the stakes too high,  the audience won't believe you'll follow through and destroy the world or kill the entire cast. Smaller stakes are better."

Bangkok Love Stories: Objects of Affection,"It's because of practical production issues. It's incredibly impractical to keep re-shooting the same scene over and over and have maybe 3 different scenes in a day where the character eats, if the actors actually eats properly during filming.

Bangkok Love Stories: Objects of Affection,Why not? I've been that way all my life. I've known families who were like that.
Bangkok Love Stories: Objects of Affection,"The servers leave the bill/cheque, expecting you to pay it at your leisure. In Hong Kong, the norm in those shops is to leave the bill immediately after receiving your food -- if not earlier -- or upon request -- ""bill, please!"". One can pay and leave on the table. No tips in Hong Kong. If change is needed, one can wait for a server, or bring directly to the cashier. This is for efficiency: HK restaurants are small; if everyone went to the cashier, there would be a big line that could block flow of traffic. If everyone waited for server, then new clients may not get their orders in, or their food in time, could be a back-up in the kitchen, etc. 

In US where I've lived, many restaurants with this norm will deposit the bill after asking if you will have anything else -- ""Just pay it when you're ready"" -- or upon request. If one is paying with a card, one will need to flag down the staff, of course, but if one has cash, then the total is there; one adds the gratuity to it as desired. Not every restaurant is this way, but those which are seem rather consistently so."

Bangkok Love Stories: Objects of Affection,"Yeah, [I was obsessed with the Granada *Sherlock Holmes*, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/oxakut/comment/h7ldk79/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Awesome show. The attention to period detail and even recreating the Paget illustrations was unsurprising given that the showrunner was John Hawkesworth of *Upstairs Downstairs, Danger UXB,* and *The Duchess of Duke Street* fame. :D  But the absolute cherry on top was their getting Alexander Baron is as a ringer to write the pilot episode (""A Scandal in Bohemia"") and start the series off with a bang when Watson comes in, sees the hypodermic and asks, ""What is it tonight, Holmes, morphine? Or cocaine?""  Baron also did, for my money, the very best ever adaptations of *Jane Eyre* (the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke one) and *Vanity Fair* (1987 with Eve Matheson as Becky Sharp). 

From that era of British TV mystery book adaptations, I'd say the David Suchet *Poirot* series, the 1980s *Lord Peter Wimsey* with Edward Petherbridge (though the '70s one with Ian Carmichael ain't bad, they didn't go into Harriet Vane territory and were a lot more Wooster/Jeeves in tone), the 1979 *Rebecca* (Jeremy Brett as Maxim de Winter), the 1979 *Racing Game* series with Mike Gwilym (which was soooo damn good, it inspired Dick Francis to write another two Sid Halley novels), and the 1986 adaptation of Josephine Tey's *Brat Farrar* are all fantastic.

The closest I've seen recently to that literary-adaptation style (and they're both still more procedury) are probably the BBC adaptation of the Robert Galbraith (aka J.K. Rowling) Cormoran Strike novels, [*\[C.B.\] Strike*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8TECB9GAk)  (HBO Max in the US), and *Case Histories* (random FAST services these days) which adapt the Kate Atkinson ""Jackson Brodie"" novels.

For silly cozies, I'm still watching *Death in Paradise*, and I liked *New Tricks*. And the Australian *Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries* series is fun, but this is more light popcorn viewing.

On the heavier procedural side of things, *Prime Suspect 1* and *2* are still up there among my all-time faves (though once it was out of the creator, Lynda LaPlante's hands, it kind of took a nosedive).  On Netflix, I like the David Fincher series, [*Mindhunters*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFlKiTwhd38) (FBI serial killer profiling drama), and Sarah Timberman's [*Unbelievable*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTIkUzkbzQk)*.* 

While more political drama than crime thriller, Hugo Blick's BBC2 series are distinct and unsettling and well worth the time: [*The Shadow Line*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNYCSNsTZSc) (FAST), [*The Honourable Woman*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg3Yzfu5kYI)*,* [*Black Earth Rising*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugxQuVPmVZU) (Netflix), and [*The English*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmcsV8_BefI) (Amazon Prime) all have his distinctive stamp on them. He's an auteur and does the hat trick: he writes, produces, *and* directs every episode of his series.

I also like the Williams Brothers crime thrillers. In the UK they were on BBC and ITV, but in the US, they're all over the damn place. [*The Missing*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXiOwboL774) (Starz)/[*Baptiste*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ1plvYFMrw) (PBS Masterpiece), [*Liar*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62jHH3GIVCs) (AMC+), [*Rellik*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWnotKVwmpk) (Cinemax), [*The Widow*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8KzGSZ40M) (Amazon Prime), [*Angela Black*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlMh9S2dBA) (Spectrum), and [*The Tourist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j_StJNMtu0) (HBO Max).

And then there's Sally Wainwright's [*Happy Valley*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwmEAPKhrVA) (AMC+)*,* which probably the best detective/police procedural series I've seen in a while. Most of us who'd seen it first found *Mare of Easttown* to be be but a pale imitation. :)  Just finished up its 3rd/final season in the UK. Will be on AMC+/BBC America/AcornTV in May in the US. I love all of Wainwright's shows, regardless of genre, but her only other detective show is the cop series, [*Scott & Bailey*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beJGiFnqCP0)*.* Though she did do a crime thriller, [*Unforgiven*](https://www.facebook.com/BritBoxUS/videos/unforgiven/745951722972377/)*,* that's on Britbox US that weirdly got remade into a Sandra Bullock thing for Netflix called *The Unforgiveable* (facepalm).   (Her dramedy, *Last Tango in Halifax* is on Netflix; her historical drama, *Gentleman Jack* is on HBO Max, and her next series is going to be Disney+'s *The Ballad of Renegade Nell*, another historical). 

Last but not least, I'd also push Abi Morgan's [*River*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrGdo8PDgzY) (Freevee), and point out that [the upcoming Netflix series, Eric, with Benedict Cumberbatch](https://deadline.com/2023/02/benedict-cumberbatch-netflix-eric-abi-morgan-sister-1235248912/) is also written by her.  Like Wainwright, she writes across a variety of genres, and also did the historical show, [*The Hour*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJxp25IJv9I) (FAST)*,* and the family/legal drama, [*The Split*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqbaDu_djOA) (AMC+, Hulu)*.*"

Bangkok Love Stories: Objects of Affection,"Midsomer Murders: A show about murders in the English countryside. It‚Äôs been going on for many years, and has managed the unenviable task of replacing the entire cast at least once. It occasionally deals with darker themes, but for the most part it‚Äôs tea time viewing. 

Death in Paradise: A British detective solves murders on a beautiful Caribbean island. Like Midsomer, it frequently changes cast (though it does still have characters from season 1) so it always feels fresh. It tends towards funnier antics especially in the first seasons, and the mysteries range from brain damagingly easy to incredibly clever. It also just started a spin off show called Beyond Paradise featuring one of its more popular detectives. It‚Äôs pretty good and doesn‚Äôt feel derivative to the original program. 

Agatha Christie‚Äôs Poirot: The perfect adaptation from the books, David Suchet is phenomenally cast and one of the best in history. The show begins pretty gentle but the last few seasons are a little darker.

Agatha Christie‚Äôs Marple:  Not the perfect adaption of the books by any means necessary, I do however love it. Especially the episodes with Geraldine McEwan. She‚Äôs amazing. 

Jonathan Creek: A Magician‚Äôs assistant is constantly roped into helping a reporter solve seemingly impossible mysteries. Whilst the idea itself sounds pretty dumb, the show is incredibly clever and pretty funny too. They made a few specials after its four seasons, but I didn‚Äôt really enjoy them as much.

Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"> Blue House, Not White House

> Designated Survivor: 60 Days is decidedly a Korean show, irrespective of its American origins. South Korea doesn‚Äôt have a ‚ÄúState of the Union‚Äù address, and thus does not have the concept of a ‚ÄúDesignated Survivor‚Äù. Park is in fact not present at the National Assembly, where the President was giving an address, because he was asked to resign just hours earlier due to his refusal to compromise in the trade agreement negotiations. 


> The politics are different as well ‚Äî South Korea‚Äôs biggest foreign policy challenge is North Korea, and this shows up a couple times throughout the pilot episode"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Was designated survivor good? I saw kiefer sutherland and figured it was another jingoistic rah rah america show.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"It was fine, not great and not too bad. The first few episodes were interesting but since it was a network show, with 21 episodes in the first season, we start getting lot of filler episodes. 

I was watching it mainly because of Sutherland & Penn."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I enjoyed it. Wouldn't say its a must see, but its better than average"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Is it remake or a spin off? I feel like it can't be both.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Remake
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Both. It's loosely based on the first half of the first season of the original, but set up by writer Kim Tae-Hee as if it's a shared universe."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I wish there were legitimate ways to watch older episodes without forking over $100 for a DVD collection. I dunno how they attract new viewers if there's no way to catch up on storylines. I understand all the way to the beginning would be crazy, but even being able to access the last couple decades on a streaming service would be cool."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,The show hasn't been the same since they killed of Dr Drake Ramoray
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I haven't watched the show in decades, but I'll always have a fondness for the 80s era - Bo & Hope and Steve ""Patch"" Johnson, Eugene and Calliope, Shane the spy, evil Victor Kiriakis.  Marlena and Roman.  Good stuff."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Everyone jokes but shows like this remind me of my grandma watching when she would stay over when she was getting to the end. Makes me miss her a lot
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I miss when it used to appear on nbc
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I can hear the opening narration forty years after my last sick day from school.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Fantastic news.

The show continues to be enjoyable and somehow is funnier than more shows on TV, comedies included."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I stopped watching at season 54, is it worth coming back to?"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Is Marlena still possessed by Satan?
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Peacock has breathed new life into the soap genre.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,...or *was* it!?!!
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,[deleted]
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Okay, so I just watched a promo (the Bo and Hope one) for this show and all I can say is what the fuck did I just watch? Like I said in another comment I'm from the UK, I watch Coronation Street sometimes with my girlfriend, but just from going off the promo, this looks almost like a parody. Corrie and the UK soaps in general take themselves pretty seriously. Please tell me people don't actually take this show seriously."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Best show on TV!!
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I wasnt aware they still ran soaps. Where do you even find them?
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Awww, I've got a soft spot for Days. My friends and I had lecture class and we'd take turns missing the first half of class to catch the show and then bring everyone else up to speed at the break."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I watched it for a good few years in my teens just for Nadia Bjorlin. There was a storyline that felt like Lost on crack with a mysterious island. Also, it was a bummer that they swapped the Brady Black of that era and recast the same actor in a different role later on. Soaps man, just bonkers!"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Must I have seen the first 59 seasons to understand the new season?
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I don't know if you've ever seen a daytime soap opera like Days but, at least from what I remember, they're more or less designed so that you can jump in on them at any point and get caught up pretty easily. They repeat plot points a lot, the progression is slow, often it's the same day for like weeks, a scene between characters could last an entire episode or longer. If you miss more than a few episodes it's not really worth going back, especially since they air five days a week, pretty much every week.

That being said some crazy shit has happened on Days over the years, it might be smart of them to put up compilations or edit down earlier seasons for people to watch. Dunno if there's anything like that."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"There are over 14,000 episodes of Day of Our Lives.

While I definitely agree that they need to market their more popular story-lines (the possession, the couple of people who have been buried alive, Stefano trapping Marlena in a giant bird cage, Melas Island and the serial killer, etc...) into easy to watch playlists, they're never going to release everything in any kind of easy-to-watch format.

Even if they were all available, it would take several years to watch through all of them."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Catch up after 60 seasons? If anything what they need is a recap service.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,r/piracy is always looking for new members
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Did you know he wrote a lot of his own lines.

Designated Survivor: 60 Days,[deleted]
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"> Calliope

Huh. Never saw this name spelled out. Feels like I would have misspelled this horribly if forced to type it out."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"My mom practically raised me on Days, so I was there through all of the 80s and early 90s stuff, but I don't remember Eugene and Calliope."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I would sit and watch grandma's ""stories"" for a couple hours every day, when I would visit, because I couldn't play NES until she was done.

I couldn't tell you what games I played after, but that time watching those soaps with her, are some of my fondest memories of that time."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I'll always remember hearing The Young and the Restless theme at FULL VOLUME, with my grandmother folding laundry in the living room. 

I also remember the time she was watching a movie...

""Grandma... You're watching Wayne's World?""

(Points at Garth, laughing) ""He's so ornery!""

(Looking up, I don't think she used the word right? But it was hilarious.)"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I dropped off around season 37, returned for season 39, fell off again around 43 and gave 48 a shot."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Yeah I'm actually very surprised. Daily formats like talk shows haven't really worked on streaming. I wonder if Judge Judy's new Amazon show is attracting viewers too.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Chasing that Grey's Anatomy plane crash high, eh"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Peacock.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I'm just a weird completionist even when there's redundancy. I'm the type of guy to watch a Sitcom in chronological order or not at all, and they're entirely made to be episodically self-contained. I'm okay to be this weird lol."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"> often it's the same day for like weeks

Seriously? I'm from the UK and even though I'm not really a big soap watcher, I still catch a few episodes of Coronation Street when my girlfriend watches it. They don't really do this. Usually one episode is one day in soap world. I can imagine it would get really confusing otherwise."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"> (the possession, the couple of people who have been buried alive, Stefano trapping Marlena in a giant bird cage, Melas Island and the serial killer, etc...)

Soap operas are really crazy lol."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"What the fuck? A possession and a serial killer? I remember my mom watching this, but don‚Äôt remember seeing that crazy shit. Insane"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Yeah but then they got rid of Jessica Lockhart!
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"That's great that there's still old timers on.  (Of course, I remember when the ""old-timers"" Alice Horton and MaDonald Carey.)  Is he still the one who announces the show?"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Eugene and Calliope were great.  They were kind of the comic relief of the show.  Almost everyone had the standard chiseled ""soap opera"" look, whereas their characters were very unique, with wonderfully quirky personality traits.  They were the funniest and most charming characters from that era, I would argue.  Trivia, for the genre inclined:  Eugene was played by John De Lancie, who would later become known to Star Trek fans as Q, from The Next Generation.  Calliope was played by Arleen Sorkin, who, in a dream sequence from this very show, was the inspiration for the character of Harley Quinn, and who voiced her on Batman: The Animated Series."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Days is different. Peacock actually promotes it, which is one huge thing nobody else is doing, and they‚Äôre doing Days live events in their app. Pretty radical compared to the ‚Äúdump it on streaming and only advertise it *during* the tv broadcast‚Äù stuff others are doing."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,">Yeah I'm actually very surprised. Daily formats like talk shows haven't really worked on streaming. I wonder if Judge Judy's new Amazon show is attracting viewers too.

Judy Justice is great. Love the stenographer and law clerk/granddaughter"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"lol then maybe a soap opera isn't for you. There are nearly 15,000 episodes of Days."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I'm the same but trust me soaps are kind of designed to just jump in mid stream and just go with it.

As someone once told me, there's no beginning and no end just middle and middle is all there will be."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"If you had access to every single episode of Days and played it 14 hours a day with no breaks or holidays, it'd still take well over 18 months, if not much more than that."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Well then don't go into soap like this. It's impossible to be a completionist with a show like that lol. Even if that was your full time job, it'd be hard."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I'm not a big soap watcher either, but I remember a few years ago EastEnders did like 2 weeks in January where all the episodes were set on New Years Eve and viewers complained about them dragging it out too long. 

It was about mid-January and someone told me ""EastEnders is still celebrating New Years"" and I went and looked up what people were saying about it. Really made me think about how British audiences would react to the pacing in American soaps."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"> I can imagine it would get really confusing otherwise.

I suppose it's one of those ""soap logic"" things people just have to get used to, like characters suddenly aging up/down, actors being swapped out, people coming back to life, etc."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Soap operas out competing comic books for bullshit.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,">Eugene was played by John De Lancie

Ah, now I remember them, but I could have sworn they were on Another World."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"""Live events"" have to be the future of streaming. Whether actually live (like Chris Rock's special) or just live premieres it seems like a way to make your show hit harder on social media. So many shows get lost when an entire season gets dumped at 3am. 

I feel like we're going to get more and more aspects from linear TV back in our streaming services. Live premieres with post shows, linear channels like Pluto has, building a schedule of similar shows to make a block of programming."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"> law clerk/granddaughter

My only complaint is episodes end with Judy in her chamber giving her editorial-style opinion with her clerk / granddaughter.

It's not Judy's editorial that bothers me, I actually find it the most enjoyable part of the show (whether I agree with her or not). It's that Sarah kind of sits there and smiles, agreeing with nods, and not saying much of anything. 

If you read old Greek philosophers they'll have essays where they present their ideas and then some nobody sidekick whose only job is to say ""Plato you're so smart"". It's a style I get but it annoys me."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,It would take almost 5 years to catch up if it was a full 8 hours a day
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I never watched that show, so I can't say for sure.  Did shows ever transplant characters?  I don't know.  But I know they were on Days!"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Sometimes the granddaughter disagrees at the end, but always in a very delicate way that isn't necessarily validated 

I feel worse for the stenographer, though, she doesn't get enough moments to shine (even if just through reaction shots)"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I'd blow my brains out long before I was done.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"The NBC soaps never did, aside from the spinoff from Days had.  I know there were occasional crossovers on the ABC shows."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,First season is great. After that it just doesn‚Äôt hold up.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I wasn't able to get past the first episode, where they pretend Iran moving destroyers to the Strait of Hormuz is some major crisis, but the protagonist defuses it by calling in the Iranian ambassador and talking tough to him.

- The Strait of Hormuz is international waters and in Iran's backyard, their navy moves through there all the time.

- The Iranian Navy is a joke, the last time the US tangled with them we nearly wiped it out, and our only loss was a helicopter the Iranians claim to have shot down but most likely crashed due to pilot error.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Praying_Mantis

- If Iran really wanted to create a crisis in the SoH, they would use naval mines and missiles, not destroyers.

- There is no Iranian ambassador to the US.  Its sorta the foundational issue for our relations with the Islamic Republic, ever since they attacked our embassy in Tehran and took our diplomatic staff hostage."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Would have been a great miniseries
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Holy cow, what is this writing?"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I wouldn't recommend it. The writing is bad and the characters are cartoonist.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I think it probably would have best served as maybe a mini series or a locked 2 season show.

It tried to be too many things, house of cards, family drama, west wing, lost/mystery show‚Ä¶there are also plot points that just could not happen‚Ä¶and the bigger questions at play (like how you could replace all of Congress, and judicial branch all at once) are given less time than say‚Ä¶daddy issues."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I think it's an original show.

I liked it but often the show didn't live up to the interesting premise."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"We liked it but lost interest after the original plotline (the fallout from the disaster) was resolved.

I guess... compare Prison Break or (in this case, either) House of Cards, shows that are ostensibly about a single plotline that was resolved early on but kept on going anyway. Personally, some of what Prison Break did next was quite memorable (that hell hole prison in, I forget where) but much of it wasn't. British House of Cards' is probably at its best in To Play The King but there's a reason they call it a trilogy... through the judicious use of time skips, it's able to put Urquhart in two new situations that evoke the original. American House of Cards' second arc was fine-ish but it was floundering after that."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Cool concept with bad execution. It was something where you could get really detail oriented and make it very authentic because the strength of the premise is so apparent‚Ä¶. But then they opted for mundane regularly tv drama with it
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I made it further this 2nd round somewhere in s2 maybe after a certain tragedy . Then I dropped it as I didn't find the politicking appealing .

Still better than when it aired live and I made it 3 episodes in  ...

I hope to finish it some day if the mood is right ."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I think this show should have been a limited series. Have what happened and uncover the conspiracy and then end it. Instead, it dragged. I think it's a really cool concept but something that shouldn't be a multi-season show.

There were times where his experience in HUD was actually showcased to help him and that was interesting.

As for the bipartisan aspect. He is an independent. Sometimes they will remind you he is independent and promote the idea of other independents. But most of the time he seems like a Democrat.

I didn't watch when it moved to Netflix so perhaps he seems more independent there?"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Well, what do you think?"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,It is a shitty TV show.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I enjoyed the first half of season one, but it started faltering by the end.  I got about halfway through season 2 then I gave up.  It didn't know what it was.  Political drama?  Spy thriller?   Something else."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,it's awful
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Does it do a good job of being bipartisan
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I have to write a hundred charecters when I just wanted to ask one question
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,">like how you could replace all of Congress, and judicial branch all at once

out of curiosity, do the justices show up in the state of the union? wouldn't that mean all branches were lost that day?"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,">that hell hole prison in, I forget where)

Panama"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,What does that even mean?
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I meant the run-on sentence, lol."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"It doesn't try to appeal too conservative or liberal

What's with the downvotes"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Yes it absolutely does that and it's really for the worse.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,Can you elaborate please
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,One of the worst deaths for one of the worst FBI agents ever written. Seems fitting.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"Semi-unrelated but I‚Äôd be down with CTU agent Maggie Q. 

GIVE ME MORE 24"
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,I actually liked season 3.  >!He becomes the thing he detested.  A true politician.  Corrupted and all that.!<
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"What a wasted potential of a series.

They could've made a show about a potential American Civil War but instead it became another poor West Wing clone."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,It's a one season concept.  It would only work if they could somehow turn it into another 24 with a new storyline each season or put it on a more premium network with fewer episodes per season.
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"I stopped watching that show early in season 2. It's like once they used up the brilliant premise of the show for that first season they didn't know how to continue, so they just threw everything at the wall to see what stuck. I don't know if the third season had this but when the second started they kept adding these horribly unfunny jokes everywhere, like the show was all of the sudden a badly written dramady."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,">- The sudden disappearance of half of the cast with no explanation whatsoever. Some were minor characters, but quite a few had major roles and had actually become some of my favorite characters on the show. Where the hell did Mike go?

I started following LaMonica Garrett after he was on CW, and saw that he mentioned he was not asked to return to DS because of the budget. So, that's where he went. 

I don't watch Designated Survivor but I saw a lot of people were mad about this when S3 came out."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"It should have just been a film. Sometimes ideas only work as one thing. This had a great premise, but not for a TV show. I wonder why it was never developed as a film. It would have made a great political / spy thriller."
Designated Survivor: 60 Days,"So I couldnt last through season 1 of this version, however I did stumble upon the Korean version of this series, which had the same big story beats and found that I liked the characters a lot better. Also they planned it only being a single series long, so everything ties up nicely. If anyone really liked the concept of Designated Survivor, id give it a shot. It worked for me. (You can find it on netflix)"

Record of Grancrest War,"Wish HBO got it....but The Boys and Expanse were good so we will see. I'd probably start with the reboot. Then if it does well, do a prequel series covering the Greece events."
Record of Grancrest War,Ben stiller better be kratos
Record of Grancrest War,"#this is awful

1. The Wheel of Time guy is a bad choice
2. Skipping over the entire Greek history of Kratos is a bad choice
3. Amazon has been putting out a lot of crap lately"
Record of Grancrest War,it's not to late to stop it
Record of Grancrest War,lol another franchise down the toilet!
Record of Grancrest War,"Fuck, not Amazon. They have ruined everything they have touched so far."
Record of Grancrest War,"I don't know about them starting with God of War 2018. 

Part of the appeal of that game was that we had seen him (and BEEN him) hacking and slashing his way through the Greek pantheon for six games and the tonal shift to seeing him as just a dad wanting a quiet life with his son following the death of the woman he fell in love with was such a shock."
Record of Grancrest War,It would have been a better news if it was on HBO.
Record of Grancrest War,"This is completely unnecessary. Amazon, how about you focus on making Lord of the Rings and Fallout good before throwing more shit at the wall."
Record of Grancrest War,The games are fantastic but I don't trust movie adaptations of video games...  I'm going to be cautiously optimistic about this one.
Record of Grancrest War,"No matter how high the budget is and how good the actors are, I just hope they have enough people from Sony Santa Monica involved that make sure they get the story and feel of the show exactly right.

Neil Druckmann was one of the writers for the ‚ÄúThe Last of Us‚Äù HBO show with also a few other people from Naughty Dog involved and that seems to have really paid off judging from everything we‚Äôve seen so far. Let‚Äôs hope the GoW show will have the same dedication and involvement from its original makers."
Record of Grancrest War,"Please, no. Stop ruining good IP‚Äôs, Amazon!"
Record of Grancrest War,Please for the love of God don't do this
Record of Grancrest War,"What a fuckin shame that Rafe Judkins is the showrunner, most important position in making a tv show and they gave it to the back who ruined wheel of time and was involved in the uncharted adaptation. Fuckin come on man, god of war is a huge property, how are they not gonna hire someone who‚Äôs actually accomplished and experienced as a showrunner. The boys is good because Eric Kripke is a quality show runner who understands the material, wheel of time on the other hand blows because Rafe is a total hack"
Record of Grancrest War,Because their last big budget fantasy adaptation did so well

Record of Grancrest War,"I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre skipping 1-3. They should‚Äôve started from Greece and it be an action packed show.

Record of Grancrest War,"Is it me, or anytime there's news of a live-action adaption for a video game I instantly roll my eyes? As a gamer, I'm fine with JUST the game. I don't need a TV show or movie to accompany it. Not to mention a lot of times it's shit..."

Record of Grancrest War,"Honestly as a huge fan of LOTR and God of War, I just can't get excited about this. Lotr is such a mid show. From the moment it was announced I read every scrap of news I could find etc and was left with such a non response to the first season so far. I just can't get excited about God of War adaptation"
Record of Grancrest War,Let‚Äôs pretend it wasn‚Äôt

Record of Grancrest War,I remember a time when I would be excited about content being made for a series I love. Now I am dreading it. There isn't a movie or show that is going to be better than the games themselves. This can only be worse.

Record of Grancrest War,"Ah, I see that they're skipping the Greek mythology era and jumping right into the Norse era, thus skipping the majority of Kratos's story, just to capitalize on the current popularity.

Fuck off Amazon."
Record of Grancrest War,I want kratos in a wheelchair and Asian.
Record of Grancrest War,"Oh hell no! Why the hell do these studios have to ruin every good game franchise by churning out ""adaptations"" that are nothing like the original?"
Record of Grancrest War,This will be bad.
Record of Grancrest War,I wonder which trans black woman will finally fix this problematic character with their brave portrayal.
Record of Grancrest War,Christopher Judge has to play Kratos
Record of Grancrest War,"Fans: We want a GoW remake of the first three games! 

Producers: What fans really want is a live action show, written by a team who doesnt like the game!"

Record of Grancrest War,Great so Amazon is going to go woke on another great series and fuck it up.
Record of Grancrest War,I‚Äôm keeping my expectations low with Judkins in charge.
Record of Grancrest War,"I truly wish they would stop making these.  None of them are ever good.  The only very good adaptations we've gotten, through like a dozen efforts so far, are The Boys and Invincible.  And realistically, adapting comic book stories to television is drastically easier than adapting books or video games, because comic books are sparse on details, which can simply be filled in.  


Even the upcoming HBO adaptation of The Last Of Us doesn't look like anything special. If HBO can't create a great show, especially with a pre-established story as deep as TLOU, then there really is no hope for anyone else.  


If this sucks, it will just forever tarnish the image of the series itself."
Record of Grancrest War,"The boy will now be a black girl, and Kratos will be Latina.

Athena is a strong black woman.

The Story of Saiunkoku,"""this will function well as a series finale, unless Apple wants to pay me so much money for season 4 that I can buy my own island."" 

Which I think is fine. Guarantee some level of closure for the series, give Sudeikis an option to move on or stay, and leave the door open if Apple wants to bring other characters/actors and writers back."
The Story of Saiunkoku,I'd be happy to see it end naturally than renewed with the writers kind of stuck.
The Story of Saiunkoku,I need a Higgins spin off where he solves crime in the countryside.
The Story of Saiunkoku,It either had to end or they needed to move it to the US.  It doesn't make any sense for his character to miss his kid's entire childhood.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I hope Ted Lasso's character gets a solo spinoff, they could call it ""Ted Lasso"""
The Story of Saiunkoku,I feel like they wrote themselves in to a bit of a corner by giving him a kid. Ted is not the type of character to not be in his child‚Äôs life even if it‚Äôs an amazing job opportunity. They kind of have to end it unless the kid moves with him to the UK or something.
The Story of Saiunkoku,That's good. I like that they get to leave on their own terms instead of being pressured into more seasons by greedy network execs
The Story of Saiunkoku,Bill Lawrence confirmed it was a 3 season arc quite awhile ago. I believe before the second season even came out. He talked about it on the Scrubs podcast (way back when I still listened to it).
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Not every show needs to last forever 

I know they are anime but full metal and death note are two of the best anime‚Äôs because they tell a story and End

Not everything needs to be the office or simpsons where the show dies but keeps going because someone will just watch it"
The Story of Saiunkoku,At least we will have shrinking.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Wouldn't it be a perfect fit for Ted to be interviewed on The Morning Show? Both on Apple and I've noticed that Apple uses a lot of the same actors in more than one show, although not playing their other character."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar, 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon honey, a pinch of kosher salt and 1 finely chopped garlic clove. Whisk in 2-4 tablespoons of olive oil."
The Story of Saiunkoku,More shows should plan to be finite. Makes them stronger pieces of work compared to letting them slowly become bastardized versions of themselves over multiple seasons.
The Story of Saiunkoku,I am totally fine with that. We've gotten so many shows which started out really strong but it became obvious the showrunners never had a clear exit strategy. Come up with a story with a clear beginning and end and don't just extend the middle part because studios throw money at it.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Ted is a character that is the glue to the show. All the stories and side characters work as a compliment and a foil to him. That's why season 1 was amazing.

Season 2 started to have characters doing their own thing, and honestly it was weaker for it. Rebecca went from this really compelling season 1 character to just being on her phone the entire second season and having that really awkward love arc with Sam. Keeley dealing with her boy troubles.... I mean it wasn't bad but it wasn't all that interesting either.

I can't really imagine having much interest in the characters if Ted isn't involved."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Season 4 will be about how Ted goes home to
America and starts coaching in the MLS. It will pair well with Apple‚Äôs purchasing of the MLS rights."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Great story it is. But the best stories end leaving the audience wanting more.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I‚Äôm sad, this show has become my comfort show lol. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a 4th season. But it‚Äôs nice to know they‚Äôre not going to drag it on."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"honestly, i would be very down for a Roy Kent spin-off with him being the Head Coach."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I thought season 2 was a noticeable downgrade from the first. Maybe it's because season 1 came out during Covid and everyone needed a bit more happiness, but I thought the writing in S2 had such a drop in quality.

The Ted's mental health storyline felt really hamfisted, the Rebecca/Sam stuff had no real bearing on anything, the Rick Astley funeral singalong veered into cringe over earnest and I still think it's so weird that Brett Goldstein has written himself to be the character that everyone loves/is attracted to/wants to be mates with."
The Story of Saiunkoku,id be fine with season 3 being the last. its been great.
The Story of Saiunkoku,Beginning middle and an end? I‚Äôm into it
The Story of Saiunkoku,Man people really turned on Nathan at the end of season 2. I'm still just waiting for the big lesson he learns in season 3. As if they were just gonna leave it at he's an asshole lol.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt think this is the greatest show ever? Like I enjoy it, it‚Äôs fine. But I also find it to be overly saccharine and the character of Roy is just so forced. He‚Äôs too much. The grumbling and the fake toughness, etc. I only ever see rave reviews/comments/posts about it and, like, I can‚Äôt be the only one, right?"
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I would absolutely love a limited series (think one short season) catered around Coach Beard. Maybe a couple years post-Ted Lasso, he‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ floating around Europe, being his best bohemian self."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Ted Lasso is the most basic, cheesey, shit. Probably why it's so popular."
The Story of Saiunkoku,What if they did a semi-AHS and took the cast and did a whole new story and characters with them the next 3 seasons?
The Story of Saiunkoku,Noooooo!!! Finally a show that is positive. üò¢üò¢
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Pay him more, Apple. You have enough money to buy all of Hollywood."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Whatever go concentrate on Shrinking it‚Äôs better anyway
The Story of Saiunkoku,"We don't need anything else regarding this show.  Just let it be three seasons.

No spin offs, nothing."
The Story of Saiunkoku,I want a Led Tasso spinoff
The Story of Saiunkoku,Ted lasso and Ted the bear move in together.  Hilarity ensues
The Story of Saiunkoku,Sad it‚Äôs leaving but fantastic to see they are ending it on their terms and how they wanted to tell it. Not many series can claim that.
The Story of Saiunkoku,I have enormous respect for creators who have a plan for their series and deliver a f@#¬£+ng ending.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Hmm ‚Ä¶

End of the story they wanted to tell. That‚Äôs a pretty open ended comment.

I mean - Ted Lasso could go back to the US, coach an American football team using what he‚Äôs learned from the UK. 

Or, he could go to Australia and coach an Australian Football team. 

New stories. Same character."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Someone at apple has been tasked w determining the cost of the average celebrity island and the revenue from Season 4.

The Story of Saiunkoku,"They could kill off the kid, but in y'know, a wholesome Ted Lasso kind of way."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Three seasons for this type of show seems about right. Season 1 ended with relegation, in Season 2 they returned to the Premier League, and in Season 3 they presumably win the Super Premier League Bowl or whatever the Brits call it. Then we all hug, cry, and go home. 

Not everything needs to be stretched out."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Kid/ex wife could move to England or some nearby country in a very convenient plot line.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"> they needed to move it to the US

Roy Kent as a college (American) football coach would be amusing."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Moving the team to the US might actually be really fun. The opposite culture clash from season 1.
The Story of Saiunkoku,or the mom dies and the kid grows up in britan
The Story of Saiunkoku,"> It doesn't make any sense for his character to miss his kid's entire childhood

Who cares about that? Just get him being hit by a ball, die and them make a fake wholesome moment about Lasso getting over it."
The Story of Saiunkoku,They could move the kid to the UK if the ex wife had an aneyurism or car accident.
The Story of Saiunkoku,Or a dark edgy reboot called Lasso.
The Story of Saiunkoku,After being a successful coach to a football club in England he travels to the US to try his hand at being an American football coach. It is a fish out of water story.
The Story of Saiunkoku,Maybe they give him a radio show. Then you could call it ‚ÄúTed Talks‚Äù
The Story of Saiunkoku,The Ted Lasso
The Story of Saiunkoku,We‚Äôll this was their plan from the beginning. It‚Äôs not writing yourself in a corner when you are setting out to tell a planned story.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Ted‚Äôs kid learning about the UK from a Ted who‚Äôs lived there for two or three years would be kind of fun, and extend it a little bit. But a clear end is a great thing to be able to get."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I think too many season's of a show ruin it rather than help it.  I understand we live in the world of ""more is better"" but not in my opinion.  Gives me 3 amazing seasons and tells a awesome arc.  Eventually, your show's characters run through their personal arcs.  All you're left with is recycling of plotlines using the same characters.    
Give me quality, not quantity."
The Story of Saiunkoku,FMA was brilliant. Death Note should have ended with that one character‚Äôs death.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I was going to say it sounds like Bill Lawerence has shrinking and a few possible
Other irons in the fire. Rather get quality over quantity."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Ha! I love this idea! 

What is this?! A crossover episode? üêï"
The Story of Saiunkoku,"And they could then end it by saying coming next ‚Äúthe president of Lumon tells us about their new technology to change work as we know it forever‚Äù and then Ted can run into the dad from Trying on a pub and Jared Leto as the Wework founder happens to be there too because it‚Äôs all a shared universe! 

I‚Äôm happy Reddit theories are not used to write tv shows"
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Fuck it, do a Bad Sisters crossover."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Apple Cinematic Universe
The Story of Saiunkoku,Is this the recipe for Ted's shortbread cookies?
The Story of Saiunkoku,Tbh it is a very good dresssing
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Boooooo hissss, haha I am more interested in Higgins, family, and his jazz roots that what happens to Ted."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Agreed. S2 lost all the fish-out-of-water underdog charm of the first. Yes there were plot conflicts to resolve but except for Ted's therapy storyline it was all hugs and smiles and opportunity. Complete inversion of the basis for the show and it was pretty boring story to have most of the high-stakes drama resolved, everyone wins, and their problems are just soap opera relationship stuff.

My one hope is Nate, I actually think his betrayal is the start of a potentially great plot that would mirror the first season."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Already have Jim Curtin in Philadelphia built in as Ted's rival if they want.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Nah, move back and coach in the PAC-12, seeing as they‚Äôre about to sign that deal. I‚Äôd love to see Ted in his element as a (proper) football coach."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"100%. Now that Ted has ""won"" and charmed everyone from British heiresses to his team to even Roy, the stakes are so low and the plots are all so irrelevant.

The biggest mistake is that the therapy storyline isn't even about Ted's family at home at all (the one thing that Season 1 did to give his character some complexity and tension). It's just about his dad committing suicide. Deep stuff I guess, but no relation at all to the story"
The Story of Saiunkoku,"You just might be, haha. That being said, nothing wrong with you. It‚Äôs just not your cup of tea, or mug of coffee if American, or bag of weed if Californian."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I think the characters are what make ethos show. Assuming their story ending involves one or more of them going separate ways, I would love a limited series based solely around one character each year. 
Year one Keeley, two Beard, three Higgins and so on. 6 episodes per season, not really a spin off in traditional form."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I know you‚Äôre getting downvoted but you‚Äôre not terribly far off, Apple has over 50 billion in cash on hand, if they wanted to they could buy Warner Brothers (est. ~37 billion) and Universal Studios (est. ~12 billion). Then we can get the long awaited Ted Lasso/Batman/Veggitales crossover we‚Äôve all wanted."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"It‚Äôs not really just the revenue, it‚Äôs the point of their whole platform. Haven‚Äôt seen a single other show on AppleTV besides For All Mankind that I found compelling to binge. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of Severance, their other hit."
The Story of Saiunkoku,By ‚Äúisland‚Äù I‚Äôm assuming he means ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äù kinds of money.
The Story of Saiunkoku,I assume because the real cost would involve setting up infrastructure and whatnot.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"There‚Äôs an island near Syracuse, NY. Probably super cheap, considering all the chemicals in the water."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Claw-dia Schiffer
The Story of Saiunkoku,Honestly I see it now. He solves crime by day and every episode ends with him doing a smooth jazz number at his local haunt.
The Story of Saiunkoku,"They could just pretend the kid never existed at all. Even if one character mentions it, Ted Lasso plays dumb and it‚Äôs all played for laughs, maybe a few jokes about milk and cigarettes."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"This could still yield a crossover with Shrinking (same team of creators), with Harrison Ford as Ted's therapist, helping him overcome grief and return to London. That would give an expanded universe for Apple, which doesn't have IPs.  

I would still send Roy Kent to coach an MLS team, helping to popularize the league, now that they have a 10-year deal with Apple."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"I like your style! Let me try. They could have the United States and Russia fall in a nuclear war, but in y‚Äôknow, a wholesome Ted Lasso kind of way."
The Story of Saiunkoku,Oh no! Is Danny Rojas gonna bean him with another ball to the head?
The Story of Saiunkoku,I  believe it‚Äôs the Super Series Bowl World Stanley Cup
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Going from promotion to winning the league would be....something.

Unless there's a time jump, that feels like it would be quite the stretch of imagination. Though maybe they can have they go for a smaller cup, and come up against Nate's West Ham in the finals."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"If they keep it realistic Richmond might win the EFL...I mean the Milk Cup, The Littlewoods Challenge Cup, The Rumbelows Cup, The Coca-Cola Cup, The Worthington Cup, The Carling Cup, The Capital One Cup, and now, The Carabao Cup. 

Could beat West Ham for it."
The Story of Saiunkoku,"Ted season 3 - ok guys, have you heard about PED's?"
The Story of Saiunkoku,Did I miss where they were promoted to the premiere league at the end of season two? Honest question

Fight for My Way,"Not surprised at all to learn that How to Train Your Dragon and Jurassic Park were both reference points for the Storm's End and dragon fight sequences. The stormy glimpse of Vhagar when Lucerys arrives at the castle was very T-Rex-y, and in general I got a similar sense of impending doom during that scene.

The aerial chase scene between the two dragons was also really well done, and the sense of scale was crazy with Vhagar dwarfing Arrax."
Fight for My Way,"Smart move because the dragon fight and flight scenes in those movies are gorgeous.

Fight for My Way,How to Train your Dragon is probably the best movie to involve dragons.  No need to try to make anything better.
Fight for My Way,"I just want to say in this thread everybody should go watch the show Quarry which he directed all 8 episodes of, got left on Cinemax to die but the season is phenomenal and the finale is one of the best directed episodes in tv history. If that show was on parent network HBO he easily wins his 2nd outstanding directing emmy. True detective s1 ep4 level with a masterful 7m long take and then a cut and 4m more to follow. It‚Äôs so fuckin good. The show deserved so much better and would‚Äôve been a hit on other streamers especially hbo, really sad situation especially because there was tons of source material to pull from for future seasons. Cannot recommend the show enough it deserves to be seen great cast/acting/directing/cinematography. Here is the trailer for anyone interested https://youtu.be/loJxKTCkoTY"
Fight for My Way,"I‚Äôve never seen httyd, but I assumed that lucerys and his dragon were partially based on that movie. He‚Äôs a dead ringer for the animated character. His dragon is small too. All the proportions are there."
Fight for My Way,"I can imagine Ben Wyatt energy: ""I watched ‚ÄòEnchanted‚Äô three times to get all the details right, and then another two times because that movie is amazing."" lol"
Fight for My Way,"""Fight"""
Fight for My Way,This is so hilarious it makes it somehow awesome
Fight for My Way,"And HTTYD actually collaborated with experts for advise on the ""technical aspects of bird flight"" when animating the film. My wife got her masters under a professor who is listed in the end credits of the movie and was part of that collaboration."
Fight for My Way,There's a new Game of Thrones series?
Fight for My Way,Why didn't they use that science-based dragon MMO? It seems perfect for this.
Fight for My Way,So they used a dragon training guide to...train their dragons?
Fight for My Way,"Worked on a game that had dragons in it. Animators tried to reference bats for the dragon flight animations cuz‚Ä¶they have leathery bat wings. It looked terrible of course. I told them to model it after the Game of Thrones dragons instead. How to Train Your Dragon would have been good too, maybe even better."
Fight for My Way,They must have been watching Shrek as well.
Fight for My Way,"nice title bro, love how it spoils it"
Fight for My Way,No duh. Plus httyd is far better than hotd.
Fight for My Way,"I don't plan to watch this show, but I want to comment on the final fight at the end of How to Train your Dragon.  That fight was a culmination of everything both Toothless and Hiccup had learned together over the course of training in the movie and the trust and friendship they built.  And from a tactical standpoint Hiccup knew this massive dragon's greatest threat was gravity.

If you don't build all that type of stuff in the show and hope for a good battle, it's just going to fall flat."
Fight for My Way,Bran king already?
Fight for My Way,Great spoiler
Fight for My Way,Spoiler. Damn. Have not finished the season. I hate entertainment news.
Fight for My Way,"Spoilers in the title, why would you do this?"
Fight for My Way,Hello? Spoiler Alert!
Fight for My Way,BRO THANKS FOR THE SPOILER
Fight for My Way,Seems about right for the dumpster fire of a show.
Fight for My Way,Spoiler title
Fight for My Way,We all immediately knew. It was practically shot by shot
Fight for My Way,Lmao woooooow so it looked like that scene on purpose
Fight for My Way,"Watching documentary to make another documentary, makes sense."
Fight for My Way,"God, the dragon action and animation was so good in this show. I‚Äôm happy to see the director took inspiration from the HTTYD franchise for bits of it. And the way they went out, too- an accidental death at the hands of a cousin, who‚Äôs now a Kinslayer who lit the powder keg for a civil war with their family at the heart of it. 

Plus the size and colour scheme of Lucerys‚Äô dragon kind of reminds me of my favourite Pokemon (Salamence, with its blue body and red wings), which *really* just twisted the knife that much more. Their death scene never fails to make me sad, yet I‚Äôve rewatched that scene more than any other for this season."
Fight for My Way,"Ahh yes, season finale spoilers in the title. Nice"
Fight for My Way,"House of Dragon was sooo predictable and boring. It felt like hbo gave the writer‚Äôs room a list of things that made the og game of thrones a hit. Incest, check!  Dragons, check!  Cheesy court intrigue soap opera, check. Torture and gratuitous gore or torture - check. But they forgot about humor, world building and any sense of cohesiveness. Compared to Andor or Rings of Power, House of Dragons felt like a B movie."
Fight for My Way,Spoilers in the title. Good job
Fight for My Way,Fucking SPOILER.
Fight for My Way,"Love it when there are spoilers in the title. 

What the fuck?"
Fight for My Way,"Spoiler literally in the title, assholes"
Fight for My Way,Thanks for the spoilers you massive dickhead
Fight for My Way,/r/nottheonion
Fight for My Way,"no wonder it was the most obvious shit ever, it was crafted for small children"
Fight for My Way,Neat
Fight for My Way,"On the behind the scenes part of the episode 10, you can clearly see how to train your dragon on in the background"
Fight for My Way,I recommend reading Zog for further dragon-research.
Fight for My Way,"I know this is meant to be a good thing, primarily because I‚Äôve seen the HoD episode and the dragon fight is great. But the headline does kind of remind me of the writers in [this sketch.](https://youtu.be/4k9_N4k5IQI)"
Fight for My Way,I was litteraly expecting for Luke to do that maneuvar from the firts movie
Fight for My Way,Disney+ should at this point make a HTTYD live action film. Just a thought
Fight for My Way,ofcourse he did i was thinking of this the moment i watched it and anyway it would be great if some does a live action movie like how to train dragon
Fight for My Way,Good idea. It's a great series
Fight for My Way,Makes sense
Fight for My Way,Aemond should have probably done the same.
Fight for My Way,We managed to save you‚Ä¶. Well most of you
Fight for My Way,Strong move
Fight for My Way,"How To Train Your Dragon was effortless in how good it was, so it's no wonder why this was something to view before doing it."
Fight for My Way,One of the few trilogies where each film is a masterclass of storytelling and visuals.
Fight for My Way,"~~Plagiarize from the best~~

I mean pay *tribute*"
Fight for My Way,HtTYD did that shit great. Absolutely use it as a reference.
Fight for My Way,Learn from the best.
Fight for My Way,"I just rewatched the first How To Train Your Dragon the other night. It really holds up, basically flawless, no wasted scenes. I enjoyed the sequels too, but the original is the one that stands out in my mind."
Fight for My Way,House of how to train your magical dragon of thrones of the ring you‚Äôre a lizard Harry.
Fight for My Way,Reign of Fire is also a good one
Fight for My Way,How to train your director
Fight for My Way,So will there be a Night Fury?
Fight for My Way,"This is a man of Quality, resolve, and unmatched charisma."
Fight for My Way,Tell me he finished the series
Fight for My Way,"How the fuck did Daemon find out about the chomp so fast? 

Did part of the body fall on his lap or something?"
Fight for My Way,That‚Äôs a good movie
Fight for My Way,"Just a theory, but I'll spoiler mark it since it relates to the end of episode.  >!Anyone think the prince could survive clinging to the netting we see on Vhagar's neck.  Since we don't see a body.!<"
Fight for My Way,Wasn't much of a fight to be honest. More like a horror thriller monster out to get you vibe.
Fight for My Way,"After watching the scene , my wife said it reminded her of ‚ÄúHow to Train Your Dragon‚Äù."
Fight for My Way,I don‚Äôt think THAT happened in How to Train Your Dragon ü•¥
Fight for My Way,Spoiler title
Fight for My Way,"both movies failed to the fact that it's impossible to do it without protecting your eyes, director should have seen Avatar, it is dumb to think dragon riders can see shit with naked eyes, pretty big error"
Fight for My Way,That‚Äôs actually pretty smart
Fight for My Way,"It's easy to forget that Roger Deakins worked very closely with the cinematographer on the HTTYD movies. ('Easy to forget' because he's only listed as ""Visual Consultant"". I suspect due to guild/union/studio rules? Even on Rango he's listed as ""cinematography consultant"")  
  
If you're gonna 'take inspiration', take it from one of the Greats."
Fight for My Way,"Finally, HTTYD getting its due!!"
Fight for My Way,Yes this 1000% should be at the top of my new page.
Fight for My Way,But why did he attack vhagar? Just run and hide little one. You were almost free‚Ä¶
Fight for My Way,I could see it with the broadside the little dragon did on the bigger one. Had some how to train your dragon vibes for sure.
Fight for My Way,"Well, I guess now I know the finale has a dragon fight, despite me not having started watching the show, yet.

Thanks, spoiler titles!"
Fight for My Way,Toothless!
Fight for My Way,"The flight scene reminded me off hiccup being above the clouds for the first time, but when he was flying during the storm it was totally like when the big queen and toothless were fighting."
Fight for My Way,[deleted]
Fight for My Way,"T-rex vibes and also GODZILLA for me!  It was terrifying seeing Vhagar off in the distance upon arrival.  I said, ""Oh shit...""."
Fight for My Way,"The sense of scale was so well done i said "" OH MY GOD"" out loud and had to replay the reveal for my kid who absolutely had to know what I was reacting to. She said ""woah"" or something. 10/10 would watch this part again ."
Fight for My Way,Also Shrek for the coronation scene
Fight for My Way,"Fun fact, much like the way the Trex wasn‚Äôt supposed to bring down the glass roof of the SUV scaring the kids for real, Meraxes wasn‚Äôt supposed to eat Lucerys and Aemond‚Äôs Reaction is genuine"
Fight for My Way,"When the big bastard comes up through the clouds, its a holy shit, he dead, moment."
Fight for My Way,Looked like that was a kid pretending to be 12 while riding a pony at the fair.
Flowering Heart,Verne seemed like such a good hearted dude. Loved seeing his posts around here. RIP
Flowering Heart,"Rest In Peace, you 3-legged stud. "
Flowering Heart,"I already miss seeing him randomly show up on the front page. Seemed like such a cool dude, RIP Verne!

Edit: sounds like it may have been a suicide too from the Instagram post. Damn that's rough to know he was struggling that much."
Flowering Heart,RIP Minime he was a big man in a small body.
Flowering Heart,Links to the donation page for his two favorite charities. [Starkey Hearing Foundation](https://donate.starkeyhearingfoundation.org/) and [Best Buddies](https://www.bestbuddies.org/donate-to-best-buddies/). RIP Verne.
Flowering Heart,[deleted]
Flowering Heart,I'll never forget how he engaged the Reddit community with his latest cooking creations...and charm.
Flowering Heart,May /u/vernetroyer rest in peace.
Flowering Heart,"I had the pleasure of shaking Vernes hand. I was 17 and star struck. When an elevator door opened and I saw Verne I said ""what's up little fella"". Even though I was an idiot by spouting out the first thing that came to mind and Vernes security looked like they were going to lay a curb stompin on my dumbass; Verne shook my hand and said ""hi my name is Verne. What's yours?"" 

You should've let your security teach me some manners, but you were better than that. It was a pleasure meeting you buddy. Rest in peace"
Flowering Heart,He's pissing in the corner of heaven now. 
Flowering Heart,His YouTube channel was something I always looked forward to seeing a new video on! He was always so genuine and funny.
Flowering Heart,"I went to the same high school he graduated from and there was a plaque in the hallway with all of his movies and he visited our elementary school on occasion to talk with the kids. Solid dude, but I never met him."
Flowering Heart,Oh my God. The shitpost king of Reddit. I can't believe he's gone. R.I.P.
Flowering Heart,"I'll never forget when he was on the show ""Surreal Life"" . He got hammered and pissed in a corner of the house from the comfort of his  scooter.  RIP."
Flowering Heart,We need to stop wording things like this. He did not simply pass away like it was something peaceful. I have seen a lot of articles doing this. Hiding the fact that people are coming suicide isn't helpful. This has become an epidemic of our age and stigmatizing it only makes people think they need to hide it away until they as well can't handle it and end their lives
Flowering Heart,"Years ago during an AMA Verne was asked who his biggest role model was growing up [and he answered:](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1xu9jr/i_am_verne_troyer_ama/cfeojhy/?context=1&st=jg9u7kav&sh=0c5ecfde)

""My parents. They never treated me any different than my other average sized siblings. I used to have to carry wood, feed the cows and pigs and farm animals.""


RIP, u/vernetroyer"
Flowering Heart,"last death to hurt me this bad was Robin Williams. :( Rest easy, Verne "
Flowering Heart,"True story: I was at Pitchfork Music Festival a few years ago watching a headlining set by Neutral Milk Hotel when some stoned fifteen year old wandered through the crowd, came up to me and said, ""Verne Troyer just died of an overdose of poppers"" and then walked away. 

Im almost ashamed to say that I checked Google anyways. 

"
Flowering Heart,Suicide is a serious thing. I‚Äôve dealt with it myself. If anyone needs to talk feel free to inbox me. 
Flowering Heart,"this guy! too sad he won't get another 45 minutes! In your next life Verne, for sure!

""Curvy 5ft 6in stunner Genevieve, 36. reveals: ‚ÄúWe had to be creative‚Äîbut because of my yoga experience I could get into the right positions to make it work. And I was soon head over heels in love with Verne.

‚ÄúWe could have sex up to 10 times in a single day. We‚Äôd do it for 45 minutes and he would just keep on going as I had orgasm after orgasm.

‚ÄúHe was a sex addict. He was then only the second man I‚Äôd ever slept with. He told me he‚Äôd had huge numbers of girls.‚Äù"""
Flowering Heart,"Just try to be nice to someone who you normally might have been a little harder to. The guy who cuts you off or such, the only thing you are really doing is hurting yourself by getting upset. Let it go and just be nice to them. You never know why people are the way they are and every single person needs a break."
Flowering Heart,[one of my favorite Austin Powers scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jZiKFLL6MI)
Flowering Heart,Noooooooo! Same feeling here! I hope you are in a better place man! Pioneer!
Flowering Heart,"Poor little bugger 

RIP"
Flowering Heart,"I can't say anything new or refreshing. 
This sub has said it all in a loving way. 
Peace and love to him and his family.
Tell your family and friends you love them."
Flowering Heart,The media is leaving something out of their articles... Like the cause. 
Flowering Heart,"Noooo! Rest In Peace man, you will be well remembered."
Flowering Heart,Best Napoleon ever. Sad he's gone. His episodes were the best.
Flowering Heart,Goodbye Mini-Me 
Flowering Heart,"Thank you for making me laugh sir, Rest In Peace."
Flowering Heart,RIP good dude. I‚Äôm sad. 
Flowering Heart,"I'll never forget seeing him on a reality TV show in the early 00's: hammered drunk and peeing off the side of his rascal onto the living room carpet. We lost a legend today, I hope history remembers him a little like Andre the Giant - entirely too lovable. "
Flowering Heart,"This comment is at the bottom and means nothing to anyone, but I feel a deep sadness reading this. I hope you found the peace you couldn‚Äôt find on this Earth sir. Wherever that may be"
Flowering Heart,"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee

- Verne Troyer

Bugger I salute you.


Thanks for giving me a great childhood. "
Flowering Heart,Tripods all around the world will remember you. May you Rest In Peace man and whatever demons you had leave you. 
Flowering Heart,Mods are already [deleting](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/8dzxqk/rbeamazed_mods_remove_verne_troyers_last_post_on/) his last comments on reddit. 
Flowering Heart,"Dude, this is sad as hell, I loved this guy.

Rest in peace "
Flowering Heart,Such a shame his life had to end so shortly

Flowering Heart,WTF?! I swear it was just yesterday he was posting his various exploits on reddit. This felt like it came out of nowhere.
Flowering Heart,"I was sure he had already died, this is like a Mandella effect thing for me. Was he recently in the hospital for something, or did a different famous little person die? I was positive I heard this months ago."
Flowering Heart,"I used to like watching him on Austin Power. He was my favorite character. RIP, dude. "
Flowering Heart,RIP dude.
Flowering Heart,"Rest in peace, you magnificent bastard."
Flowering Heart,"RIP Verne, such a sad loss honestly... he brought such joy to so many and he was such a humble and kind-hearted guy! "
Flowering Heart,I hope it wasn't a suicide. From the post it sounds like it might be the case.
Flowering Heart,Life is short.
Flowering Heart,Buddy I will never forget that time you pissed in the corner drunk on one of those reality tv shows (I actually did forget what one) but you were exactly the real life that show needed. 
Flowering Heart,what kind of watch is that?
Flowering Heart,"I can‚Äôt stand articles like this, stop pretending to care just because someone died. 

You didn‚Äôt care he suffered from depression. That article definitely didn‚Äôt get 19k karma up votes.

Sad, that only when someone dies do people pretend to care. "
Flowering Heart,He lived a short life 
Flowering Heart,Was some drinker for his size..he could drink anybody under the table.
Flowering Heart,"What's left to say but that he came into this world the same as he left. 

The same size.



I'm sorry. "

Flowering Heart,"/r/fuck2018, the sequel to /r/fuck2016?"
Flowering Heart,I'm a little sad.
Flowering Heart,He lived a short life
Flowering Heart,"Thought it was a joke...another early death :( and for such a sad reason too. 
RIP buddy"
Flowering Heart,He was an amazing person.  He made me like the Dallas Cowboys after being named MVP in 92 and winning the Superbowl
Flowering Heart,This is sad news.
Flowering Heart,:(
Flowering Heart,"Bummer

Flowering Heart,May his soul rest in peace.
Flowering Heart,I‚Äôd like a gif of him peeing on the floor.

Flowering Heart,Now to binge Shasta McNasty.
Flowering Heart,This is so awful. Prayers to his friends and family.
Flowering Heart,R.I.P. buddy.üòá

Flowering Heart,Sad especially considering the circumstances
Flowering Heart,Avicii and now Verne... 
Flowering Heart,"Damn, sad to hear. Much respect Verne. RIP. I hope you are out racing a fast car in the next life. "
Flowering Heart,I am sad 
Flowering Heart,"Noo! Two far too young celebrities gone in just as many days. What a shame :/ 
Rest well Verne, thank you for the smiles you put on peoples faces."
Flowering Heart,:( 
Flowering Heart,FFS. Living on Earth has merc'd another person I dig.
Flowering Heart,Mini me you complete me :( god speed Verne you will be missed!
Flowering Heart,"I salute you Vern, thanks for everything."

Flowering Heart,Sad day r.i.p Verne üò¢üôèüèΩ Aka (mini-me) 
Flowering Heart,"Reddit is less without him, but more for having had him. Thank you Verne."
Flowering Heart,"RIP, big fella. That's sad. It mentions depression. Terrible disease that some of us know all too well. "
Flowering Heart,"That is so sad, I wonder how he died?? "
Flowering Heart,Sad to see his life was cut short by depression.
Flowering Heart,"Your heart was bigger than you could handle, miss you  Mini-Me"
Flowering Heart,Are you really that stupid that you miss the humour in that statement..hes always under the table you knob..he was barley3ft tall.. go back to the short bus ^^
Flowering Heart,Rip
Flowering Heart,RIP man. Never take anyone or anything for granted. 
Flowering Heart,There have only been 2 celebrity deaths that hit me personally: Robin Williams and Verne Troyer. They are both sorely missed. 
Flowering Heart,"Just curious, he was only 49,

Is it common for little people/people with dwarfism to have short lifespans?

Not trying to upset anyone, just a genuine question"
Flowering Heart,Rest in peace mate. Loved your YouTube channel. You will be missed by many. 
Flowering Heart,"Loved him as mini me! Tbh I'm surprised he was alive this long, I thought dwarfism also accelerates growth in certain areas... Rip dude"
School 2017,Luckily haven‚Äôt seen a single one of these lol
School 2017,I highly disagree about Heels.. it was a well written show with good drama.
School 2017,A worst shows of 2021 list is incomplete without Apple TV's Invasion included.
School 2017,I will not stand for Heels slander.
School 2017,I'm not entirely convinced half of these shows aren't made up.
School 2017,"i had to sit thru Sex/Life. Wife loved it, for me every minute was torture."
School 2017,"I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin. It was canceled the same day it was released (hyperbole).

Also, where are Wheel Of Time and Foundation? Again, I enjoyed both, but I spent a considerable amount of time on both subs and both series are very divisive 

Heels doesn't belong on this list. A Best of 2021 series..

I agree with Yasuke. I was expecting historical fiction that made me Google a whole bunch of terms, but instead we got some science fiction junk. Did have a great soundtrack."
School 2017,"Never heard of Them but it's got a great iMDB score. I don't know if I mind a little ripping off, that's how new frontiers are explored. There wouldn't be a lot of great bands if they never ripped off Black Sabbath."
School 2017,"Katla is fine imo.

Invasion and Cowboy Bebop deserve to be mentioned on this list."
School 2017,Wheel of time for me. Expected and wanted better.
School 2017,"Gossip girl reboot was so painful. I would argue that *some* of the case is talented. The actor playing Julien makes me want to stab myself with her delivery. Max is like Chuck bass lite. Audrey is like only the nice parts of blair with none of the spice. There‚Äôs not as much plotting which is what made the original so much campy fun. I think they need more monet and Luna to inject some life into this thing. I feel like zoya julien and Obie and aki don‚Äôt have much charisma to speak of 

Also I literally couldn‚Äôt  believe how cringe the writing/ dialogue on sex/ life was. I‚Äôm shocked I finished either of these shows but I was couch bound for a period of time so that‚Äôs probably why"
School 2017,"lol Didn't even know there's a remake of I Know What You Failed at Last Scream Ripoff.

Speaking of which, that wasn't even a great movie to begin with. I don't know why anyone would bother to remake it."
School 2017,Definitely agree with Katla. The first episodes I was hooked because you want to find out how and why these things are happening. But the season falls apart more and more with each episode and characters doing incredibly incredibly stupid shit.
School 2017,Lee Pace is solely responsible for Foundation not being on this list. It should be though.
School 2017,The most remarkable thing about this list is that Foundation and Invasion are not on it.
School 2017,"Thankfully haven‚Äôt seen these. And the ones I know of, I actively avoided. The worst show I watched was Nine Perfect Strangers. Couldn‚Äôt even finish it."
School 2017,Have a feeling the 4400 reboot will make this list when it comes out. Only saw Katla was hyped for it due to who was involved but just your average Netflix/SVOD drama.
School 2017,"I know it's not a new show, just a new season, but Snowpiercer season 3 has been pretty disappointing. First three episodes were okay, then five where basically nothing happens, and now one moderately good one leading to the season finale which just looks like it's going back to the first season."
School 2017,"I thought Gossip Girl was entertaining as hell, and I enjoyed having the Hawaiian setting of I Know What You Did Last Summer on in the background as I was doing other things. There's way worse stuff out there. Like Invasion or The 4400 reboot."
School 2017,"My full round-up of 2021 television (including this post):

* [Top 25 TV shows of 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/rp4ufb/top_25_tv_shows_of_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**Worst main character** ‚Äî Zoya (Gossip Girl) \[runner-up: Yasuke (Yasuke)\]  
  
**Worst ensemble of characters** ‚Äî Gossip Girl \[runner-up: Paradise City

*Thank you guys so much!* üíï"
School 2017,Book of boba fett started in December right?  Lol
School 2017,did only watch katla from the list. i wouldnt say one of the worst but that review couldnt be more agreeable. writers sucked badly about a good premise and cast did really bad job on this.
School 2017,"Wondering what Sex/Life would be like had it bee made in the 80s and if Patricia Rozema directed all episodes. Maybe it's the times, but shows about a woman's rock phase now has less bite than it did forty years ago. 

Also, another friend of mine tweeted about how Sarah Shahi plays a psych major but can't figure out her basic bitch of a husband which is accurate."
School 2017,"Yasuke instead of being what it should have been - probably something like Rurouni Kenshin, wanted to be Samurai Seven and just couldn't make it."
School 2017,I actually watched I Know What You Did Last Summer and even enjoyed most of it in a so bad it's funny way for the most part but the ending was just offensively stupid.
School 2017,I don't think I've even heard of a single one of those.
School 2017,This is literally the first time I've ever heard anything negative about it.
School 2017,"Definitely. Heels is a gem with a 8.1 score on IMDB after 6.2K votes. Ace, Wild Bill, Jack and Crystal are interesting characters with nice tension between some of them and the plot, which feels authentic, made me very invested."
School 2017,Nor will I sit for it
School 2017,"If you only use reddit as proof, then any book adaptation is going to be garbage. Outside of the diehard book fans, wheel of time did really well. It had good reviews and great viewership. Even the ratings are good when you consider the fact that diehard book fans brigaded and gave one star reviews"
School 2017,">I liked it, but Cowboy Bebop should be #1 by a wide margin

Not even close.  Yasuke was clearly worse."
School 2017,"It's not really a rip off, black horror is a popular genre now. Jordan Peele is not the only person that can make black horror films."
School 2017,"They could've at least not titled it ""Them"" considering there's a recent release called ""Us"". Like if you're going to rip off Black Sabbath you probably wouldn't want to call yourself Dark Saturday."
School 2017,i agree with invasion.
School 2017,Yep.  It‚Äôs one of the worst shows I‚Äôve ever watched.  And I‚Äôve watched a lot of cheap sci fi/fantasy made in the 80s & 90s.
School 2017,"Agreed. My expectations were tempered as I knew cuts would have to be made.  But they introduced entirely new scenes, rewrote character personality and motivations, and switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

School 2017,"It‚Äôs almost a bit disrespectful regardless of how good the film is to force that semantic ‚ÄúUs and Them‚Äù connection, normally reserved for spiritual sequels, to a film they have no relation to, purely for marketing reasons.

It reminds me of a book I read where a superhero called Battery (because she charges energy) is forced to take on a partner who calls themselves Assault, purely to completely change the meaning of Battery‚Äôs identity through the automatic ‚ÄúAssault & Battery‚Äù association."
School 2017,"For a second I thought I was on the Witcher sub cause everything u described happened with the Witcher lol.

>	switched several important achievements/events to female characters.

The only difference being that the achievements were mostly given to one character, Yennefer. So much achievements and character arcs were given to her that folks speculate there is some [self insert](https://reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/rwhzzh/the_show_is_in_love_with_yennefer_and_it_will/) going on with the showrunner. It probably also doesn‚Äôt help she said Yennefer is her favorite. The cherry on top is that I wish the only change they made was giving her so many achievements and character arcs, they also decided to just completely change her character from the books.

Season 2 is 90% made up with the first episode being the only one that is somewhat based on the short story from the first book. The rest is I kid you not all made up. Even the ‚Äúdeathless mother‚Äù, which is a huge character in S2, doesn‚Äôt even exist in the book. To add insult to injury it was the showrunner‚Äôs second time promising the season this time would be a close adaptation with little to no original content. With s3 coming she is once again promising the same thing on her twitter lol.

School 2017,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
School 2017,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

School 2017,"Great list----there are only six of the shows you listed, including Desafrenadas, that I've never heard of, but they definitely sound worth checking out because of your descriptions of them. Here's a couple of faves of mine on Netflix, some of which I didn't finish before they got taken off, and some I haven't finished yet, along with one I'd like to see, and haven't seen yet:

1.The Protector----a Turkish fantasy-thriller that lasted four seasons, with 10 half-hour episodes for each season. It's about a young guy who runs a shop with his father, who discovers after a tragedy that he's been chosen as the Protector, and that he's part of an ancient people with superpowers who fight the demons, called the Immortals, that are trying to take over the world. I've seen only one season so far, but it was pretty good, and fun to see a fantasy action series with a Turkish take on it.

2. Paranormal--- Netflix's second Middle Eastern series (after their first one, a Jordanian series called Jinn, which lasted one season). It's set in 1960s Egypt (where it was actually shot, because it's based on a popular series of horror books by an Egyptian author, Ahmed Tawfik.) It's about a hemotologist and college professor named Refaat Ismail who finds himself literally haunted by ghosts from his past, even tough he dosen't believe in the supernatural. He also finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of curses and supernatural terror anyway soon after he comes in contact with a mummy that he winds up stealing to de-curse it, along with another man who's trying to stop the mummy from cursing everything else around it. He, the dude trying to do the un-curses, and his crush, another professor named Maggie, wind up going to the desert, being chased by demon creatures and haunted by other things. Really fun and lively old-school show, only six episodes. It's supposed to get a second season later this year---I enjoyed the first season, so looking forward to the second.

Liked three of the Marvel shows----Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, and Daredevil---but my laptop conked out the same week all three shows were leaving Netflix for Disney Plus and I didn't get a chance to finish watching them, lol.

La Reina del Sur---a Mexican drama about a woman who winds up on the run after her drug dealer boyfriend is murdered to another country, where she winds up being too close to some more major drug and trying to keep her head above water. This long-running popular telenovela inspired a reboot of the series back around 2017, I believe, and an American version of the show called Queen of the South. It's very exciting and action-packed all way."
School 2017,"Cobra Kai wouldnt count for this list because the first season aired on youtube, i think"
School 2017,"For real-----even though I'm old enough to recall when the real case jumped off back in the day, and even after seeing the Ken Burns documentary that finally told the Central Five's side of their stories---When They See Us, which was very well made, was still difficult as hell for me to watch, knowing that these young boys--which is exactly all they were, no matter how demonized and hatefully stigmatized they were at the time, mainly because they were black---were going to jail and put through literal hell for a crime none of them committed. Yeah, they survived, but some of them still bear the scars of what they went through, and what it took to survive that, even today.

The second youngest of the Exonerated Five, as they now are able to call themselves, Yuself Salaam, wrote a book last year about his experiences called Bitter, Not Better: Living In The Pursuit Of Racial Justice, that's worth reading. Here's a review of it: [One Of The Falsely Accused Five Tells His Story](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/18/997792060/in-better-not-bitter-one-of-the-central-park-five-tells-his-own-story)"

School 2017,"I'll tell something I experienced about Super Mario Bros. 3. It's a 2D platformer that is widely hailed as a masterpiece, one of the greatest 2D platformers ever made. I said to a person online that I consider it a truly great game. He immediately attacked me, saying ""you're blind by nostalgia, take off your rose-tinted glasses"". I have no nostalgia for Mario 3, played it for the first time a few years ago, I told him so, and he went back in his criticism. But if I hadn't, he was basically going to call me out on my love for the game! Actually, he had already called me out for loving the game, and he assumed that I was nostalgic for it! But even if had very strong nostalgia for it, he would still be wrong in criticizing my high praise for the game! Even if I was nostalgic towards it, nostalgia shouldn't suddenly make my judgment and love towards it less valid and less well-thought. As if I have no critical sense, as if I don't understand and deeply scrutinize what I love, and I know why I love it, why it deserves MY love and praise! This is why I think that people who say things such as ""it's not as good as you think"" and ""you just have nostalgia goggles"" are assholes.

I highly recommend this video essay.

Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"Something to note is that most of SVB's assets are in long term, low interest bonds. So even with them having terrible timing and buying at the highest point right before the biggest historical interest rate increases in decades, the bonds will still probably liquidate for like 80 cents on the dollar (so at worst depositors get a small haircut)

Edit: new article indicates that SVB sold a $21b portfolio of bonds at a $1.8b loss (bonds bought at 1.79% interest vs 3.9% today), that is around 85 cents on the dollar."

Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"You're correct but you're missing the leverage part.  If they used 1 dollar in deposits to buy 20 bucks worth of bonds, then if the assets get liquidated for 80%, the investors get 4% back."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"There's a growing thought their liabilities now exceed assets since their assets declined so much, due in part to their mbs's getting absolutely hammered and they didn't hedge them"
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"It‚Äôs honestly even likely that they can find a buyer at 100% of the value of the deposits. Keep in mind that SVB is a business. Banks, as businesses, are frequently worth more than just the sum of their assets. Historically SVB has traded over 2x the value of its deposits. So a buyer is getting an extremely steep discount even at 1x the value of its deposits, if they buy SVB itself and not just all its assets - and that‚Äôs very likely. 

That 1x would be an awful, awful investment if you are just getting their book of assets. But if you get their book of assets *and* their ‚Äúbank‚Äù, it‚Äôs a pretty good bargain. On top of that, say you‚Äôre JPM and you do all the math and you decide that actually the best price is worth 92% of deposits. Others have pointed this out before me, but there‚Äôs immense strategic value to you as a bank to just bump it up to 100% and make everything hunky dory. 

The companies that are likely to get totally fucked by this meltdown are not those in Roku‚Äôs shoes, who have a big number there. They‚Äôre mid-sized companies who need money in the next two weeks, and have 100% of it at SVB. Although it‚Äôs very likely SVB gets acquired (imo), the timeline and availability of funds is more unpredictable."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,It'll come out to under 60 cents on the dollar I believe.
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"Exactly, if you're really well off like that, you've got to use a mega-bank.  Even SVB with 200 billion in assets is tiny next to BofA and JPMorgan."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"SVB was the 18th largest bank by assets. Not exactly a small bank. But yeah I see your point, if either of those 2 banks you mentioned collapsed like SVB the government would probably be forced to bail them out or the economy would mist likely collapse."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"What‚Äôs happening with these startups is that they are holding their money at the mega banks. That‚Äôs even true in Roku‚Äôs case, and where they‚Äôre holding 75% of their money. SVB just does some things with really high service levels which are startup friendly - the thing they are frequently cited for is paying wires quickly and efficiently. Roku, as a consumer electronics company, cares about that a lot.

What you‚Äôre seeing with Roku and others is that these SVB accounts are analogous to what you would be keeping in your ‚Äúchecking‚Äù account, while the rest of the money is in a ‚Äúsavings‚Äù account. So Roku has a lot of money here because they‚Äôre probably taking payments to this account and distributing payments from this account."

Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"Well yeah, this is almost certainly true. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre in trouble. But they aren‚Äôt just a book of bad assets. They‚Äôre a pretty good business fundamentally, holding an awful book of assets. So their value to an acquirer is likely more than just the asset value.

and JP Morgan will get their money back a few days later, + an entire portfolio of bonds and clients. 

It really is that simple. SVB failed for the dumbest reason. One sheep started running and the rest of the sheep trampled over their home in a panic to get out, and now they get to live in a corporate house."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"> They‚Äôre a pretty good business fundamentally, holding an awful book of assets.

By definition, startup companies collectively are awful assets.  SVB F'd up by not hedging the estimated value of their total assets.  When they had to do ""mark-to-market"" on essentially start-up companies, those assets didn't adequately backup SVB's lending, so SVB became insolvent.

> This is historically a pretty good enterprise

It arguably is, but SVB is a dead duck.  Their asset portfolio is garbage.  Why buy SVB, when depositors can get similar terms from JP Morgan, or a better run competitor?"

Think about the dollar amounts involved in a company like that just doing payroll. I‚Äôm not sure how you can come to the conclusion that they were ‚Äúprobably investment instruments‚Äù."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre asking in the first paragraph. No, I don‚Äôt think that the funds being uninsured would imply at all that they were illiquid to Roku. Do you mean they were in illiquid investments made by SVB?

Again, very unlikely IMO that Roku loses this money. The big issue is that it‚Äôs inaccessible in the short term. For Roku, sounds like that‚Äôs not a huge issue, but for others could be an issue"

Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"It was TV for people who used public transit to commute. But since it launched at the exact moment the bulk of that audience started working remote because of the pandemic, it completely missed the subscriptions ramp it needed to control costs and eventually hit profitability."
Chivalry of a Failed Knight,"I mean ya, they chose a bank as a safe place to store money and earn 1-2 percent interest while still having full access to the money as needed.

The bank then took that money, leveraged it, and put it in a very safe bond investment. 


Then interests rates rose a lot and just kept rising. Normally this would be fine as long as the bank has enough assets to cover immediate withdraws since they will still be earning more money over time than they give the depositors even if the investments are currently down. 

But with high interest rates suddenly the Venture Capital firms want all their money back. Instead of letting it sit in a bank to be ready for investments they want to buy bonds themselves and earn a guaranteed 5%. 

A few large clients do that, suddenly the banks assets look shaken and a few more do. Now the bank has to try to cover the increased immediate  expenses by selling their otherwise perfectly safe long term bonds at a loss. News breaks they are doing that, now everyone wants out and the bank collapses. 


It‚Äôs not that crazy of a system and from what I read no one acted irresponsibly, a bank buying leveraged bonds is pretty standard. It just happened to be at the right (wrong) time for everything to go down poorly and since they were a specialized bank with exposure to just Silicon Valley, it was easier for news about the run on the bank to spread and easier for conditions to change that would effect most of their clients. 

It‚Äôs not like they bought falsely rated mortgaged back securities claiming they were a safe investment when they really weren‚Äôt which is what collapsed banks in 2008"

But they had over a year to adjust their bond and asset investments, as everyone knew the Fed was going to jack up interest rates.  Any bank CEO/CFO should understand what ""mark-to-market"" means.

I think less of Lehman than of Bear. Bear basically ""bet the company"" every 24 hours and when they could not get overnight repo , the firm *failed*. 

That's because  their raison d'√™tre was finely grained arbitrage on those interest rates. But they still had zero tolerance for error; one missed swing and they were done.

Its not even about Blue vs Red.  Wall Street owns both political parties, by design.  Its not an absolute control, by either Law or firearm, but effectively Wall Street gets to operate unaccountable to the Law, because they pay the politicians to write the Law, the PotUS and his ""ministers"" to execute gov't policy in a manner favorable to their interests, and the US AG, who determines who gets prosecuted.  (And after their stint in gov't, those ""public"" servants find new jobs within Wall Street befitting their value to those they've done favors for.)

> I think less of Lehman than of Bear. Bear basically ""bet the company"" every 24 hours and when they could not get overnight repo , the firm failed. 

No, I don't choose to make one or two losers responsible for the banking collapse of 2007.  All of the major Wall Street players were responsible for the collapse, from Jamie Dimon of JPMC, especially Lloyd Blankfein of GS, *and* Treasury Secretary Henry Paulsen who ran GS before Blankfein, AIG, all the major subprime lenders (from WaMu to Countrywide), and Rubin for repealing Glass-Steagal and Treasury/Fed Reserve officials in both parties for allowing the derivatives market to become Wall Street's casino and to keep it unregulated (to this day).

There's a significant contrast to the players in 2007 and SiVB today.  For the past **two** years, inflation was running rampant, and *everyone* knew the Fed was raising rates.  All bankers know they have to meet liquidity standards, and they're supposed to be aware where they can get squeezed and become ""insolvent"".  Their CFO must be some kind of moron or criminally negligent/reckless about how the bank could become insolvent.  And by management principles, that also makes the CEO a moron/crook.  But notice how so many of the industry professionals like to pipe up and suggest it was a ""black swan"" or a ""mistake"".  That's because many, if not most, of these banking assholes (outside of the TBTF) operate in a similar ""risky"" manner.

What kills me is that ENRON failed in an analogous way in 1999, and no banker or gov't regulator in California learned from that mistake."

I knew an actual person like Ted during college - I thought it was a schtick at first and despised him. Took me too long to realize it was genuine because I couldn‚Äôt believe someone could have that healthy of an outlook on life - he had off days like everyone else where he was more mellow, but he never, ever, wavered from believing in others and himself, being selfless, and wanting to do the right thing, even when no one was looking. 

He still did well for himself, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but he could‚Äôve/should‚Äôve been the President or something. Don‚Äôt think he was naive, but his own personal ambitions were so far down his totem pole compared to helping others that the corporate-ambitious people probably halfway used him wherever he worked, and moving up just wasn‚Äôt one of his motivations for doing anything. I wish I could form some coalition of other people that know him to campaign for him to get what he deserves"

My Golden Life,"> where there is almost zero stakes or meaningful conflict

It's fine if you don't like the show, but this criticism always makes me laugh for any show. I don't know what constitutes stakes or meaningful conflict for people in a make believe world. 

The show has peoples marriage's failing, relationships not working, 1 of the players derails his own career, a person coming to terms with retirement. I don't know what more you're wanting in terms of stakes and conflict... especially when the main character's whole philosophy is believing in yourself and trying to be a good person."
My Golden Life,">	It‚Äôs a big budget lifetime movie stretched into a show, where there is almost zero stakes or meaningful conflict

I mean it's true that in Ted Lasso the primary characters aren't constantly maneuvered by the heavy hand of plot into pointless interpersonal tension to create scenes that end prematurely so that the conflict can persist for the whole season like every other fucking show on TV, but that's what a lot of us like about it - there's real emotional stakes in the show, they just don't come from by-the-numbers TV yelly bullshit.

The scene where Ted takes on the rich team ex-husband in a game of darts in season 1 is one of the most tense and ultimately thrilling scenes I've ever seen filmed, and involves no dramatic misunderstandings or inappropriately withheld information, zero ""will they/won't they"" sexual tension, no conversations that end right when they're getting somewhere, and absolutely no characters who apparently only talk to each other for the three minutes when they're in a scene together.

Around about the 100th time you see a ""prestige"" TV show where 100% of the critical interpersonal drama could be resolved simply by a phone call that *doesn't* end just as soon as someone makes a dramatic reaction face, you'll be ready for something like *Ted Lasso*, where people actually continue conversations to emotional resolution."
My Golden Life,"The show's had stakes and conflict, though.  From the start it had the whole Major League plot where Rebecca was set on tanking the team, so you had Ted and everyone else's careers on the line.  Then of course there was Ted's trials with trying to be accepted by the very team he was leading, as well as navigating his relationship with his wife and son.  Roy and Nate had their arcs as well.

I think what might throw some people is that the stakes largely involved interpersonal relationships."

My Golden Life,His problems don‚Äôt go away though. The show is about that. He can‚Äôt save his marriage and he‚Äôs fucked up because his dad killed himself. It‚Äôs like you somehow took the exact opposite reading from the show.
My Golden Life,"While I understand how you might find a successful millionaire footballer hard to relate to, him being someone you don't traditionally sympathise with is kind of the point.

It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor, won the championship or not, coming to terms with the transitions in our lives is universal.

Similarly to the other conflicts in the show, they are human problems not rich people problems. It's fairly comparable to how science fiction can tell stories of love, loss, politics and everything in-between while being completely unrelatable on the surface.

I understand why some people don't like the overall cheery feel to the show. It lacks grit and can feel disingenuous but often it's a nice change of pace from the grim setting of many other TV shows."
My Golden Life,"> like all our problems will go away if we act like Mr. Rogers.

I mean that's not at all what the show is saying. Especially when in fact the Mr. Rogers in the show is the worst off psychologically in trying to not deal with his problems and just being like Mr. Rogers. 

I'm not saying you have to like the show, I think I understand why you don't. It's not a big exciting type of drama or action that you might prefer? But it's still more than very wealthy people with very minor problems."
Zombie Dumb,World War Z would have been such a great TV show if it was based off of the book. Each episode or couple of episodes could've been a different interview that was a missed opportunity.
Zombie Dumb,Did anyone notice the Asylum logo at the start? Read: Abandon all hope ye who enter here.
Zombie Dumb,I'm going to watxh next week. It might get better. The acting is rough though.
Zombie Dumb,"I wanted to like it, but the acting and production are typical of other SyFy shows and movies.  This is another show on SyFy that I tried to watch, but couldn't get past the awful acting.  These people strive to have the acting ability of reality tv stars.  "
Zombie Dumb,[removed]
Zombie Dumb,its like half comedy/half serious. They should just make it full comedy completely stupid and funny. have a guy run through a pack of zombies with a chainsaw fun.
Zombie Dumb,I mean is there really anything left to add to the zombie formula?
Zombie Dumb,"Watching it right now and as stated in the article the thought that comes to mind is why fucking bother? It's not even schlocky fun, it's just pointless noise."
Zombie Dumb,"Recorded it to watch at my leisure, watched 15 minutes and deleted it and the season pass.  What a disappointment."
Zombie Dumb,Holy shit its terrible. Like even for SyFy standards its awful. So laughable this was the networks answer to The Walking Dead.
Zombie Dumb,"""Dumb, gory show adds nothing to the zombie formula"".

Completely true... but I still liked it.

It's low-budget junk food.

Why are people expecting it to be something it isn't??"
Zombie Dumb,"Tried to watch this show.  Turned it off about half-way through.  This is some ""straight to DVD"" quality shit right here."
Zombie Dumb,[deleted]
Zombie Dumb,"I've seen the first episode. They messed up the show by introducing that zombie baby, really funny."
Zombie Dumb,So once again the commercials/trailers give away everything and leave no surprises.
Zombie Dumb,This is why I came here for comments rather than check it out. Good to know.
Zombie Dumb,"OK, I liked episode 2 better. I'm guessing the older the zombies get the slower they move. Because on this episode they were not as spry as the last.  "
Zombie Dumb,The guy on the radio has potential to be a worthwhile addition to the zombie formula.
Zombie Dumb,"Different strokes? I enjoyed the campiness and thought it was a lot of fun, though it's not going to be something I think about ever when I'm not watching it. It amused me to no end how obviously it was an Asylum production, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and zombies are everywhere, and fast. And it had a twist at the end I didn't see coming. I mean, I know it's dumb, but that was sort of the point?  I'll be watching next week"
Zombie Dumb,"Face it, we'll never get a good zombie show."
Zombie Dumb,OP adds nothing new. Misses the point entirely. 
Zombie Dumb,They're making tv shows out of Scream and Minority Report. I say there's still a chance in the future to see a WWZ show.z
Zombie Dumb,"I always saw the perfect WWZ adaptation as a Ken Burns-style documentary series (complete with ""wartime footage""). "
Zombie Dumb,I'm giving it one more week to redeem itself but I don't have much faith.
Zombie Dumb,"I think it was more the writing then the acting. A lot of the cast are experienced, decent actors. "
Zombie Dumb,"Can really tell they didn't give much for this 1st episode. Defiance had very good production and acting for a syfy show, and is the only show I watch on the channel. This show felt like a syfy original moster of the week movie. They have the story, they just needed to care more about it. 

If it stays the same as the 1st ep in acting/production quality, it won't last."
Zombie Dumb,"Have you seen Death Valley? It's a comedic version of Cops (think Reno 911) with zombies, werewolves, and vampires. Only ran for one season back in 2011, but I enjoyed it."
Zombie Dumb,I totally agree. Make it sort of a spoof on zombie subgenre. Make us laugh. If a movie/show is funny then it is easier to overlook how bad it is.
Zombie Dumb,I did not get the comedy part at all. Could you please give me an example from the pilot?
Zombie Dumb,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzFF_N_RRBE


In the Flesh.  A show about what happens *after* a zombie apoc. has come and gone, and the people left try to rebuild their society. Which includes ""partial death syndrome"" victims (aka ""cured"" zombies)  being re-introduced to society.  "
Zombie Dumb,"There's that new show called iZombie coming out. Zombie girl pretends to be human and works at a morgue, she eats the brains of the diseased and gets a glimpse at how they died and helps solve crimes. Based on a comic of the same name. "
Zombie Dumb,They need to fire the writers and start over. 
Zombie Dumb,"Genuine, gritty survival. I haven't seen a zombie movie or a zombie show where it's just about surviving. There's no military to fight, no dangerous outlaws to fight with, no cure. Just a group of people or even just one person standing off against the unfortunate situation they've been thrust in to. 

I want to see the zombie version of 124 hours, I want to see the zombie version of Castaway. "
Zombie Dumb,Maybe not but I think we do want to watch more interesting stories about a world with zombies. To me The walking dead and Zombie land are the standard that other shows should try to surpass. I guess it's hard to get it right because there are a lot of failures out there.  
Zombie Dumb,"How could you be disappointed?  That implies expecting *anything* from the show.  Its the same production values as Sharknado and their other shit.  


I found it mildly entertaining,  which is all I expect from a late summer, Friday night, syfy zombie show. 


I mean, seriously.  How did you expect *anything* from 

>late summer, Friday night, syfy zombie show.

"
Zombie Dumb,"During the scene with the z-Baby, you could see a crew member in the background (at least an arm). Kind of destroyed the scene for me (that baby was still freakingly scary and fast - nightmare material!)"
Zombie Dumb,People aren't expecting it to be something it isn't. People are wondering why SyFy continues to release the same low budget garbage that everyone expects from them. 
Zombie Dumb,"""Dumb, gory show"". I do not like ""dumb"" things (unless they are funny, then I hate myself for liking them), but why ""gory"" is used as a negativism? "
Zombie Dumb,"To be fair, that's what The Walking Dead is supposed to be.. it's more about the living people than it is the dead. The problem is season 2 took it too far and drove a lot of people away. TWD never claimed to be an action packed zombie thriller."
Zombie Dumb,"You reddit people make that out to be a much bigger deal than it is. 


First of all,  a show like this, spoilers don't matter.  Second,  why are you still watching commercials?  Fucking DVR or Pirate,  no reason to watch live tv anymore. "
Zombie Dumb,He had a nice moment of pathos when it was revealed that the video call with his girl was a recording.
Zombie Dumb,"I really miss that show, it was so damn funny with a few dark spots. Really worth checking it out. Just the idea of having monsters roaming the the valley...genius."
Zombie Dumb,the dumb baby running around as a zombie? idk seemed silly to me.
Zombie Dumb,Wow thanks this is a great show.
Zombie Dumb,I swear to god the BBC needs to advertise their shows better. How have I not heard of this before
Zombie Dumb,"I think I am going to watch this series instead of Z Nation. 

On the second thought, after watching 5 minutes of it, I realized that this is going to be just another zombie comedy. First zombie comedy was funny, then it was like the same joke repeated over and over. 

That's the existential problem of comedy, you have to be genuinely original to be funny. You can show me almost the same explosions again and again, and I'll watch it salivating over my porterhouse, but that won't work in comedy."
Zombie Dumb,"So Pushing Daisies with a zombie? I mean, I guess I can accept this."
Zombie Dumb,"But that's a zombie show in name only. There's a show with a zombie in it, and then there's a *zombie show*. Know what I mean?"
Zombie Dumb,The Walking Dead worked best in scenes without zombies. 
Zombie Dumb,"I disagree. I loved Zombieland but Walking Dead is not something a show should look up to or try to be like, in my opinion. If I were making  a show about zombies I'd look at The Last of Us."
Zombie Dumb,"> That implies expecting anything from the show. 

Syfy was supposed to be turning itself around and going back to its BSG high, with the new shows based on Childhood's End and the Expanse. But I guess it was too good to be true. "
Zombie Dumb,If I could cancel my subscription to only the sci-fi channel I would. That's how disappointed I was in this show.
Zombie Dumb,The baby shouldn't have been fast at all. Babies have such bad motor control and muscle development that a zombie baby would likely just flail around. When this started bugging me I realized I was taking it way too seriously and dumbed myself down a bit.
Zombie Dumb,"> People are wondering why SyFy continues to release the same low budget garbage that everyone expects from them. 


Because niche channels like Syfy are literally subsidized by the existence of the cable package.  They're not trying.  Hell, niche channels were never supposed to chase ratings in the first place, dammit. "
Zombie Dumb,Because they make money that way.
Zombie Dumb,"There's a connotation with overly-gory shows/movies being pretty bad, and using that as lipstick. "
Zombie Dumb,That seemed like unintentional comedy. Too bad I knew this will happen at the very first frame with this baby.
Zombie Dumb,"But it's the exact opposite of a comedy. It's a drama with fleshed out (no pun intended) characters. Maybe just watch the first episode and see if you change your mind, it's not a comedy at all."
Zombie Dumb,"Well then, you just sold me that show. "
Zombie Dumb,I get you. 
Zombie Dumb,"I don't think The Walking Dead is about zombies, its about surviving, in the same way Zombieland is about surviving.

World War Z the film was about the zombies and curing it rather than surviving.

I think the show The Last Ship combines good elements of surviving the failure of society and elements of looking for cure or solution to the illness"
Zombie Dumb,"> The Last of Us

I haven't played that game so I don't really have anything to compare it to. I'll have to disagree with you on the Walking dead. These sort of things are subjective but I know a lot of people would agree with me on the walking dead. That show has been a monster of success. I think it has been well earned.     "
Zombie Dumb,"wtf are you talking about? those could still be good. and this is the first bomb theyve released since the revamp. Helix was a great show, dominion wasnt too bad and defiance is well... its still on?.. so i guess its not doing too bad for itself. look at every other network they cant all deliver gold with every release"
Zombie Dumb,But they cruelly teased us with the hope for quality programming when they aired BSG. 
Zombie Dumb,I would pay extra for AMC. I would cancel sifi if they would let me.
Zombie Dumb,"I guarantee you they make less money off their original programming than networks associated with quality original content (HBO, FX, etc.). Taking the path of least resistance isn't particularly lucrative for them either, it's just what's safest. This is despite the fact that they recently pretended to be shifting towards more ""quality"" original content that was supposed to mark a change for the network. Instead they've continued delivering the same low level shit (this, Helix, and without a doubt the upcoming '12 Monkeys') "
Zombie Dumb,">overly

I think most people lose expectations of any subtlety before committing to watching a zombie show."
Zombie Dumb,I am really confused right now... May be the comedy was not intentional?
Zombie Dumb,"ill agree with that, i got a lot more out of the last ship than i expected"
Zombie Dumb,"> World War Z the film was about the zombies and curing it rather than surviving.

It is a real shame that WWZ didn't stick with the basic concept of the extremely enjoyable book.

I do get that you often have to sacrifice original content and many plot lines to create a movie, nevertheless WWZ was disappointing beyond measure.

 There was rarely a movie that disappointed me more."
Zombie Dumb,"Maybe not, but like I said in a previous comment, I don't care about the people surviving. Except for Daryl. And Glenn. "
Zombie Dumb,I don't disagree. But then again look at any thread involving TWD. It's a bunch of people watching a zombie show and proclaiming they're too sophisticated to enjoy it.
Zombie Dumb,"Yeah, if there's any comedy at all then it's intended to be dark. I don't remember much comedy at all quite frankly though. The show is all about a post zombie apocalypse world learning to accept the undead. I remember the show getting me quite irritated in a few scenes with how the undead were treated by the living.

It's definitely worth another go honestly. Try to watch the whole of first episode and watch it as a drama because that's exactly what it is essentially."
Zombie Dumb,Maybe not what?
Zombie Dumb,HBO has a western series: Deadwood.
Zombie Dumb,"The problem with a Red Dead adaptation is that the plots are just pastiches of like, every big western movie ever. They'd really have to steer into an over-the-topness to avoid just seeming like an endless string of cliches, but that isn't really the game's vibe."
Zombie Dumb,"Not sure how Red Dead's story, while awesome (one of my faves) would prove upon all the amazing western movies that already exist.

I think they should create a show based on Bully."
Zombie Dumb,Then there would be a red dead show on HBO
Zombie Dumb,I‚Äôd rather have Blood Meridian
Zombie Dumb,That's what Westworld season 1 felt like to me
Zombie Dumb,Are people at Rockstar up for an adaptation? I've read that they denied multiple chances at turning GTA into a show or movie. Maybe it's the same for RDR.
Zombie Dumb,"I don't really care about where shows come from, I just want shows I enjoy.

If they made this and it's good then sure, more western shows would be cool."
Zombie Dumb,i want more stuff like arcane personally. something new. i don't have much interest in only these cinematic games also being shows/movies.
Zombie Dumb,Sooo all those dumb yellstone shows?
Zombie Dumb,An original story set in the rdr world? Sure. A 1:1 adaptation of the games? Fuck off.
Zombie Dumb,It would literally be a western though with mean-humor?  TLOU has supernatural horror edge though.
Zombie Dumb,Or maybe just maybe watch some of the old western movies? Most of the stuff from the game is basically references from popular westerns of the past. Try some of the gritty Spaghetti western or if you want some comedy the Trinity trilogy with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill.
Zombie Dumb,Doable. They'd just need to change the story a bit. Take out the big western cinematic set pieces and bring in some original ideas. Red Dead is better as a game though.
Zombie Dumb,"The film and television industry loves to follow trends. If The Last of Us remains a hit, there will be more video game adaptations. Not sure if a western is the best genre, though."
Zombie Dumb,It would have zombies.
Zombie Dumb,Red dead 2 has a pretty clunky story that has to twist established lore to fit. Although that probably wouldn't matter in an adaptation.
Zombie Dumb,"It could certainly make a good show if it was done well. However the Red Dead Redemption games would be *much* harder to adapt than The Last of Us. The story is much longer and more meandering than TLoU, which is pretty tight as games go, both thematically and narratively."
Zombie Dumb,"Red Dead was already made over 50 years ago before.

Essentially Clint Eastwood cowboy movies are the ""go to"". Not to mention Italian western and Japanese westerns.

And if you seen Hell On Wheels... yes that's basically Red Dead."
Zombie Dumb,It's called Deadwood
Zombie Dumb,We dug coal together
Zombie Dumb,"People have often made a similar statement how awesome a Sleeping Dogs movie would have been, but in reality, no, it wouldn't. The game is likewise a pastiche of major HK triad movies and themes, it would be extremely derivative. They're clever and fresh when you're not aware of them, but if you've watched a lot of movies from a given genre of film, not so much."
Zombie Dumb,"Yeah, as much as I loved *playing* the games, I don't think they'd make very good TV, as is. Nothing much original in the narrative or characters.

I see people suggest a GTA show too, and for the same reasons, no thanks."
Zombie Dumb,"I agree with you but still feel with a great cast, score and action pieces that would be enough to carry the show even if the story is simple and done before.

There are plenty of emotional scenes where the actors can showcase their talent. As well as many cool action set pieces that in an ideal world would be amazing to see live.

Agree it might not be the best adaptation material but I would be first in line to watch it not gonna lie."
Zombie Dumb,"It‚Äôs not about a red dead show being a badass western, it‚Äôs about telling the story, which is absolutely brilliant.

The last of us isn‚Äôt just your ordinary zombie movie, it‚Äôs a story. Red dead isn‚Äôt your ordinary Wild West shootin game, it‚Äôs a freakin story about a cowboy who has grown to regret the life he lived."
Zombie Dumb,"I guess the only adaptation they've ever done is Max Payne with Mark Wahlberg. And since nobody here really remembers it, makes sense why they haven't done anymore adaptations."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Only A-Listers in the Building (not a complaint)
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep was a combo I didn‚Äôt know I wanted to see
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,She already won The Emmy for that teaser
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Hulu throwing shade at Netflix by making a third season of a show
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Gosh, what a fun show, can't wait!"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I have to give them props. My initial reaction was, ""There's a THIRD season?""

And they immediately lampshade the elephant in the room."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Streep having fun is best Streep!
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"They really turn around new seasons for this show fast, eh? Not that I'm complaining."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,How are there people left in this building with all these murders!?
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Release date?
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Now, throw in Harrison Ford as a grumpy old resident of the building."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,i want this show to go on forever
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Love it!! ‚Ä¶ Can‚Äôt Wait!! üòù
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Hopefully the guest stars are better than Season 2 this time around. Michael Rappaport and Cara Delevingne made Season 2 a slough to get through. Amy Schumer wasn‚Äôt good either but at least she was only in it for a little bit.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I have had my account on pause for a year... It may be time for me to hold Netfux and get Hulu back for a while.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,The best show on streaming is back!
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Really looking forward to this. Any news on the release date?
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Is this the first season of this show to have been shot without any significant COVID restrictions placed on it? I do sort of think of this show as a COVID show (maybe THE Covid show?)

I wonder if that's going to have an effect on it. A lot of that quiet, low-key, almost podcasty charm of the show I think was due to those limitations causing the show to find creative workarounds.

It might be that even without those restrictions, they stay in that general shape because it just... works?

(although S2 did flanderize itself a little bit in a couple different ways. Still loved it tho)

edit: LOL what the hell - is this question getting downvoted because... a PANDEMIC actually happened? I don't get it. I honestly want to know."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Love this show and supporting my girl Selena. Can‚Äôt wait for S3! OMG cast for this season is amazing!
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,This is perfection. I just binged 2 seasons. First season is a visual treat. Definitely made for NPR listeners / New Yorker readers.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Is this show good? Like actually good?  

Can I ask people who really like this show what *other shows* they really enjoy so I can see if it's a good fit for me?"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,friendly reminder that she supports roman polanski
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I really enjoy this show but the ending to season 2 was a real let down. The acting performances were great and there is some good writing, but the plot ended up convoluted and messy."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I hate Meryl Streep. I hope she doesn't have much screen time.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I'll watch, but season 2 was a 5 out of 10."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Didn't think they could make it any better, and then they add a legend, Meryl Streep, and the funny, sexy, and iconic Paul Rudd to the mix. I can't wait to see where this season takes us"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Season 2 was a farce.   They should have left it as a great mini series.

Won't be watching this"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"When I saw that thumbnail, it took me a couple seconds to remember Robin Williams is dead. ‚ÄúHelloooooooooo!‚Äù"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"‚ÄúOnly on Hulu‚Äù, and by that they mean released 3 months later everywhere else on Disney+ but since the Hulu-D+ merge hasn‚Äôt happened yet I guess I have to sail the seas like with every Hulu show because I‚Äôm not waiting."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I gave up on this show like 8 episodes into S1 but it's been on my watch list for a while. This definitely seems more like a fall watch than a spring-summer watch
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Awful
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I hope they put some more effort into the scripts again. Don't get me wrong, season 2 was as much fun as the first, but storywise it was all over the place."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I only got into this show a couple weeks ago but binged the hell out of it. Didn't realize how much I missed Steve Martin and Martin short after growing up on their movies. Also, for the first time in my life I would consider myself a Selina Gomez fan (I missed the Wizards of Waverly Place boat by a year or two)."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I wonder if 20th Television and Hulu are just sending a dump truck full of money to the cast or if it's a ""I'll take a pay cut to work with Steve Martin"" type situation."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Uh exqueez me? You clearly hate B and C-Listers, not to mention the D-Listers. I‚Äôm literally shaking.

üòÜ

Edit: FFS I was joking"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I demand a cameo by Jiminy Glick.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,They will throw in an oscar too
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,[Same energy](https://youtu.be/wZ5R1TZwKK0)
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,hulu canceled reboot after one season
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I know people are iffy on the movie, but she was so hilarious in Don‚Äôt Look Up. She was having so much fun with that role"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,The cast made a instagram video where they treated her like a waitress/intern.  It was pretty funny.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"It is nice to have TV on a regular schedule and not the 2-3 year cycle that it‚Äôs often becoming. 

Suppose it‚Äôs a lot easier to do when most of the show is shot in the same couple of building sets"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Not really. We are still shooting this current season. It'll be mid to late summer before anything airs.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,This and slow horses.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,It doesnt honestly seem like a big thing to film like no car chases or explosions or cgi. The biggest thing is just scheduling really.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Presumably they're receiving regular resupplies from the same place the Midsomer Constabulary keeps getting all its ill-fated Englishmen and the various NCIS branches keeps getting all their dead naval officers.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Well I'm guessing prices are dropping because of all of the murders so that attracts people taking the risk
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,My guess is 3-4 months.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"One would think they'd include that with a trailer, no?"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I assume June or July
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,They need to save some A-listers for future seasons as well no?
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Um‚Ä¶ did you see Meryl Streep in this teaser? That trumps all guest stars of every season of every show.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I would say the writing and lack of jokes made season 2 a ""slough to get through"""
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Amy Schumer is just awful, I cringed everytime I saw her on the screen."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I'd say tiger king was THE covid show.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Honestly the closest thing I can think of in tone is Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. With a playful modern detective setting.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I don't know how the upvotes and downvotes are going to go with my reply but it is the most okay-est show I think I've ever seen. It's really, honestly, okay."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"why don't you start with saying what shows you consider good, so we know if it's one for you or not? way easier"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Season 1 was pretty good.  I describe it as a nice show to watch 

Season 2 was a mess of inconsistencies and the biggest praise I can give it was they managed to release the season pretty quickly after season 1."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Season 1 was a fun ride but the ending was very unsatisfying (read: flat-out bad).

We couldn't get through three episodes of S2."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I only like it to watch the Martins chew scenery.  I loved Steve in L.A. Story and My Blue Heaven, and loved Short in Innerspace and as Ed Grimley, the inventor of the dab.  Selena Gomez started out with wooden limited emoting skills but the Martins' infectious comedic chops warmed her up by S2.  It's not a sincere puzzle show where you need a notebook and a pen to take notes like Primer or the Scream movies.  It's a very ""Manhattan"" show for you to watch with your teen daughters.  It falls between Always Sunny stakes and Good Place wholesomeness.  I didn't watch this week to week, just waited until each season was over to binge it all in a day while under the influence. Hope this helps!"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"s1 was actually good

s2 was kind of a chore"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Hopefully she won't be in too many episodes like Amy Schumer in season 2
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Season 2 released each episode on Disney+ the same day they were released on Hulu (at least in Canada, and I assume most countries other than the US)."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I think it's the former. I read an article in Variety before the second season that said the two Martins were both making $600k per episode. Safe to assume they're throwing similar numbers at the big name guest stars.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,have you considered your joke was bad
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,***Only***
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I'm still mad about that one.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Probably
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Last season was last summer, so a lot better than most streaming shows nowadays."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Are you working on the show?
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I believe Slow Horses was originally purchased for 2 seasons, so they shot the first 2 seasons back-to-back. Then Apple renewed it for 2 more seasons, so they are shooting 3 and 4 back-to-back. It has certainly helped them release on an accelerated timeline."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"S1 and S2 [both began dropping in the summer](https://www.epguides.com/OnlyMurdersIntheBuilding/), so I'd agree."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Still plenty of A-listers
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I really can‚Äôt stand Meryl Streep. The whole siding with Weinstein, cheering for Polanski, and ignorance during her acceptance speech in 2017 has really soured me on her."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I don‚Äôt think that was filmed during covid.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Ooh thanks for the reply
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Why would I do something the easy way?
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"As in lame or somehow tr-tr-triggering? üò±

Either way it is what it is, it‚Äôs there and idc anymore"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I forget at times how easily offended some people are by the most innocuous things
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Totally agree about her support for Weinstein and Polanski, it's disgusting. But what part of that 2017 speech did you think was ignorant?"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,">ignorance during her acceptance speech in 2017 has really soured me on her.

Oh, majorly.  Fuck her."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I don't know why you are downvoted.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I guess I meant it in the context of it was the show that we were all captive audiences for during early covid.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,">	tr-tr-triggering

god this kind of humor is so predictable and pedantic. legit r/onejoke"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"The biggest thing that annoyed me with that speech was her saying tighter immigration would mean ‚Äúyou'll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.""

Because mixed martial arts is an incredibly global sport and at the time more than half the champions were not American. In fact, right now in the UFC only three of the 11 champions are from the US. Also claiming it isn‚Äôt an art is pretty ignorant.

I did come up with a reason why she oddly attacked MMA though: days or weeks before her speech WME-IMG bought the UFC and it just so happens they‚Äôre also one of the largest talent agencies in Hollywood but she‚Äôs represented by their main competitor, CAA."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Because the Reddit hive mind puts her on some weird pedestal despite plenty of evidence that she‚Äôs self serving and a bad person. It‚Äôs the same thing with Alec Baldwin and I think it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre both publicly anti-Trump.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what the person was talking about. A lot of shows and movies had to make changes while filming to adjust around Covid restrictions.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"What is wrong with baldwin? I've seen a few reddit comments that toss shade at him, never heard what makes him bad though."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Yea. Re-reading it you are right.  Although I still wouldn't call it THE covid show as much as I would call it one of the shows who's production was disrupted by covid.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"There are a bunch of accounts of him being a pretty big asshole (not the Trump stuff, like to random people)."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Of course he's an asshole, he's a Baldwin.  There are many famous people that are also assholes.  That's not worth treating him like Kevin Spacey."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Really hope Sanrio and Netflix plans on doing more collaborations for shows in the future. Especially since the final season of Aggretsuko arrives February of next year (which I'm going to miss dearly).

Dear Sanrio and Netflix, if you're reading this, please make a new My Melody series right now! If that happens, then I hope they give My Sweet Piano a bigger role. I remember watching tons of English subs of the Onegai My Melody anime back during my Middle School days and falling in love with it. And this is coming from a grown man!"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Looks really cute.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"Pressured by people and an expiration date. Same little buddy, same."
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,Missed opportunity for a hard-boiled detective series
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,TV show of the year lets go
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,This is some cute/wholesome shit. But December 13th is too far away.
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,"I've been to Japan a couple of times and many of the stuffys and merch show its little butthole. It has no butthole on the merch for the US, however.

RELEASE THE BUTTHOLE, YOU COWARDS!"
Hatchimals | Adventures in Hatchtopia,with this and that rilakumma bear season 2 i may resub to netflix
Radio Romance,">however. There‚Äôs a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom

They bring this up as a negative point but I really loved that in the first couple of seasons of GoT."
Radio Romance,[deleted]
Radio Romance,"Rolling stones is interesting and one I really see as a positive. I hope theres more focus on politics, intrigue and dialogue. Season 1-3 were the highlight of the original series (and books) for that reason. 

Also the problem that the quotable/witty characters might be a blessing in disguise. The show ended up destroying itself and those characters because they became beholden and flanderised based on those lines/subsequent popularity. Tyrion in particular."
Radio Romance,"When the negative reviews are ""too much dialogue"" I'm in."
Radio Romance,Am I the only one struggling to see any inherently negative points in a lot of these negative reviews?
Radio Romance,"I am cautiously optimistic 

There are a few things that I‚Äôm apprehensive about though. Succession filled the void GoT left behind of a political power struggle with many moving pieces that managed to be far more grounded than GoT. House of the Dragon has to live up to both it and GoT in that regard in my opinion 

Another aspect is that I really preferred the production of GoT in its earlier seasons where it managed to do a lot with what was available. Later seasons felt like they went big for the sake of it which I felt made GoT lose some of its charm and HotD seems to be closer to later GoT in terms of production 

I really hope it delivers tbh"
Radio Romance,I am not surprised that Milly Alcock gets some praise here. Even in just the trailers you can see she has some great charisma and presence. I wonder if her older replacement will be able to keep up with her performance.
Radio Romance,"The only thing I can conclude from these, is that, most random reviewers just aren't worth listening to. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking the same approach with this and the Lord of the Rings TV show - my expectations are going to be set so god damn low, that it's almost impossible that I could be let down. 

&#x200B;

Narrator voice: ""He was later let down in dramatic fashion"""
Radio Romance,"I'd say we should go in with managed expectations. As far as I'm aware, the source material is sort of like a history book more than a novel. 

When GoT show overtook the ASOIAF books, there was a significant noticeable drop in writing quality. Characters started acting more petulant and dialogue became mostly juvenile.

I really do hope this show is a return to form though. But most fantasy live action in the last few years has turned out absolutely abysmal."
Radio Romance,"Critic reviews for TV are much less important than those for movies. Because critics only judge a TV show based on a couple of episodes, their reviews are  always missing the entire picture. Unlike a movie which is experienced fully and therefore you have a much better understanding of the product.

TV shows are a much longer commitment and therefore your true score will only come over time as your brain digests the material to a fuller extent.

GoT had some middling pre-reviews for S1 as well. It was only after the entire season had finished that some critics went back and thought ""Y,know what? That was actually pretty good!""

I always give a whole season for a show to find it's footing.

Edit: The truly damaging review comes from Slate Magazine and it was done by a game reviewer. Awful choice and makes me disregard the review, even if it was positive. Video games are a more action-packed medium and this is a more ponderous story."
Radio Romance,"Saw it on Wednesday thanks to Tiff in Toronto. I absolutely loved it. Now, it‚Äôs a great pilot, but the next two episodes will really show if its got legs. Personally, I think its a very promising first episode, the writing, acting and directing was very strong. Plus, its a fucking great looking show with no comparison (some weaker cgi here and there but great compared to other shows). 

I was so ready to be done with the show and go back to rereading the books, but now i‚Äôm excited for Sunday again.

Plus, it feels like GoT, the politics, the intrigue, the danger‚Ä¶ and I think the story they picked will work really well for TV."
Radio Romance,"I‚Äôm super excited, not gunna lie."
Radio Romance,"Saw the first ep on Wednesday. I think it is going to be decent. However, people need to give it a chance with an open mind. I'd probably still watch anything GoT related that came out anyways, but I'm sure there are some people who are really bitter of how the show ended and are reluctant to give this a go. Really excited for Matt Smith as Daemon."
Radio Romance,"I know it all depends on the execution, but the mixed reviews talk about the focus on the politics of the kingdom and sitting around tables debating as if they werent the most engaging parts of early GoT. That being said, those scenes may be poorly put to screen in House of Dragon, will find out soon enough."
Radio Romance,"Should I even watch this if I‚Äôve never watched Game of Thrones?. The ending scared me off, but I am interested in this new one."
Radio Romance,"I see a trend when somewhat middling reviews start to appear for a soon-to-release popular property. Redditors start to pick apart those middling reviews, saying things like, ""The critic has a problem with *that*?! Ridiculous! That particular nitpick is what I *love* about the property!""

But when the dust settles, the critics are rarely wrong. A show that gets middling critic reviews is almost always middling. That doesn't mean it will be *bad*, and that doesn't mean it won't *improve*. 

But, I'm definitely going into this show with lowered expectations. Hopefully it will be halfway decent."
Radio Romance,"From the reviews here and the comments, it seems like people don't understand that this too is a book? A history book, to be exact. Reviewers and commenters are making statements as if the show runners came up with the story."
Radio Romance,"[Slant: A Frustrating Jumble of Incident and Spectacle](https://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/house-of-the-dragon-review/)

> House of the Dragon must really believe its own claim that ‚Äúthe truth does not matter, only perception,‚Äù for it ultimately is more interested in fan service‚Äîoffering up more dragons, more gore, more surprise murders, a more expensive historical re-enactment‚Äîthan it is in developing scenes that ring true for its characters. Game of Thrones veterans like director Miguel Sapochnik and composer Ramin Djawadi can make this new series look and sound like more of the same, but it‚Äôs as hollow and brittle as the massive scale model of the kingdom that Viserys takes pride in building. That‚Äôs a rotten foundation for an epic fantasy, so maybe the prophecy was correct after all: the only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon was itself.

[Empire: The writing so far lacks the sparkle of Game Of Thrones' most profound moments.](https://www.empireonline.com/tv/reviews/house-of-the-dragon-season-1/)

>For all its po-faced plotting, this show has plenty going for it. A decade time-jump in episode six, recasting several characters, gives the series a new energy; D‚ÄôArcy and Olivia Cooke (as the troubled Queen Alicent Hightower) breathe new dimensions into their aged-up characters, and the sudden switch-up suggests a show unafraid to take risks. This is a prequel that could surprise us yet. But to even skirt the heights of Thrones‚Äô best work, it has an uphill dragon ride ahead.

[Indiewire: HBO‚Äôs Devout ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô Prequel Rarely Roars to Life](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/08/house-of-dragon-review-got-prequel-1234752881/)

>Co-showrunners Miguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal, along with co-creators Condal and George R.R. Martin, make misogyny‚Äôs destructive influence the series‚Äô central theme, but it‚Äôs more of a convenient shield than a piercing dagger. After all, this is a prequel to ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù; where Westeros ends up has already been set. Learning its past isn‚Äôt far removed from its future is both part of the point ‚Äî feigning interest in how the medieval fantasy‚Äôs patriarchal power structures and boastful man-babies mirror modern day‚Äôs similar problems ‚Äî and a safe path for the network‚Äôs first spinoff of its highest-grossing franchise. The first six episodes set up an intimate yet epic tale of how misbegotten pride, outdated customs, and an obsession with power burned down a long-thriving kingdom‚Ä¶ all while enjoying the ensuing ugliness more than they examine its unnecessary proliferation. Pure spectacle and (often icky) soap opera make for intermittently absorbing TV. Mainly though, the new ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù sticks safely to the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù that preceded it, rather than fight for any meaningful change."
Radio Romance,"Meh - looking at what critics are choosing to praise here, I've slightly downgraded my expectations."
Radio Romance,"so, tons of childbirth scenes, THE STRUGGLE

&#x200B;

will still watch, though, because I'm bored"
Radio Romance,">Rolling Stone had a negative take, noting, ‚ÄúPalace intrigue, and questions of succession and legitimacy, were of course a huge part of Game of Thrones, but far from the only part. And they were only sometimes even close to the most fun part of a given stretch of that series.

Sepinwall enjoyed Game of Thrones for far different reasons than I did, it seems."
Radio Romance,[deleted]
Radio Romance,"I think people are too laser focused on what they perceive the review is I don't think they are complaining that politics are always boring, but rather that the show lacks in other areas that GoT didn't. There was plenty of political intrigue there but also lots of hillarious moments intersped with it, you could have Varys doing spy master stuff learning about everyone's position on matters and then have him discuss court gossip and marveling at the tales of Podrick's amazing sexual powers. 

Hopefully it isn't like that and the show's tone is more complex and not just FIRE AND BLOOD, non-stop. Even Tywin relaxed from time to time."
Radio Romance,Any idea if I need to have seen GoT to watch this show?
Radio Romance,"A big problem this show will have is that it can't be all things to all people like Game of Thrones did. GoT is like a diner that has a little of everything (burgers, chicken tenders, shrimp, quesadillas, etc.) while House of the Dragon is like a seafood restaurant (depending on your preference, one is better than the other). With GoT, there were plenty of people who said they only watched for the political intrigue or dragons or white walkers or Dany or Arya or Jon or the battles or the magic or a particular actor or actress or large scope or large number of characters or to root for certain characters to die, etc. House of th Dragon has some of that stuff but not all it it so it would be nearly impossible for it to be as big of a show as GoT (even if they season 8 had been incredible). They only way it could would be if it could get new people. Also, I hear GoT was the highest watched show for HBO in 2021 despite the bad ending and it being 2 years after it ending so that's a little hope for this show."
Radio Romance,"> however. There‚Äôs a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom  

That is exactly what I'm here for. I can go plenty of places and get high flying wizardry and sword fighting. *The Crown* is fucking awesome, and it has zero dragons, sword fighting, or wizardry. 

I thought it was a great pilot episode, it didn't try to be GoT *exactly*, while still feeling like GoT (to me at least). GoT was a generational phenomenon, and impossible to recreate 1:1. Any attempt to do that would likely fail based on probability alone. 

I like the fact the show might be more concentrated. Sometimes GoT felt way too sprawling, and characters were moving around the map at breakneck speeds, especially towards the end where the scale of westeros really shrank.  

I thought the cgi could be cleaned up some in a few shots, but nothing too egregious. Some really great acting performances also.  

I usually love an underdog, so I think I'm gonna be team princess. I always wondered what Henry VIII would have done if he had just realized that one of the most influential monarchs in English and even world history was sitting right under his nose, so it was really fun for me to see a monarch do exactly that in this episode, even if it was a pretend one. Can't help but wonder if GRRM has the same question."
Radio Romance,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens compared to the more expansive scope of the original series:

the show is literally named ""house of dragons"" why was this person expecting stories of baratheons and starks?"
Radio Romance,"THR review has to be a meme.

Show is called House of the Dragon

Gets mad that it focuses on Targaryen Family"
Radio Romance,I just wanna see /r/freefolk implode if it's good
Radio Romance,"I'm going to say something that will bother many: if it wasn't for HBO, the reviewers ratings would be much worse."
Radio Romance,RollingStone points out the reason I've been so apprehensive about this show -- too much palace intrigue and not enough common folk stories from the wider world to ground the whole thing.
Radio Romance,[deleted]
Radio Romance,"Yeah I don‚Äôt know if people will ever get over the awful ending and return to the GOT universe. I can guarantee that this show will never even touch the ratings that GOT had back in its prime. Maybe it will start to pick up traction in a few seasons, but I think we all are still a bit scarred and this was too soon if you ask me"
Radio Romance,"These reviews don‚Äôt inspire confidence in me - someone who wanted a reason to be pulled back into the show other than just ‚Äúit‚Äôs more GoT and more dragons.‚Äù

I expected more quality from this show tbh."
Radio Romance,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens

You're telling me House of the Dragon is focusing on the house whose sigil is dragons and who owns dragons??!

*shocked pikachu face*"
Radio Romance,"Whatever, call me when it's done. If they don't screw it up, then I'll watch it."
Radio Romance,"Idk if it's cause the last season or two of GoT turned me off to it so much or what, but the trailers didn't make me want to watch"
Radio Romance,"93% on RT so far, can‚Äôt wait"
Radio Romance,*fart*
Radio Romance,Looks like it‚Äôs worth the watch and a palette cleanser for that last season of GOT
Radio Romance,Is it even worth watching if i've never seen GoT?
Radio Romance,[deleted]
Radio Romance,I was interested in watching it so I rewatched all of GOT and remembered why I'm done with the series all together. I hope you guys find enjoyment where I find pain lol....

Radio Romance,"Grace said it‚Äôs good so it must be, I‚Äôm very excited, cannot wait for it to drop

Plus seems like GOT meets Succession, and as a fan of both I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fun"
Radio Romance,How much of the season have these reviewers seen? Always feel weird to judge something that isn't whole yet.
Radio Romance,It‚Äôs to big to fail‚Ä¶.. they will talk about how great it is till we think it is. Hopefully it will be‚Ä¶.. see already starting to work!
Radio Romance,I prolly only watching this for Matt Smith.
Radio Romance,"No matter what anyone else says, the show is still gonna be ""tainted"" by the slap-in-the-face GOT ending. I'm still pissed."
Radio Romance,"I'm not super excited about this. I'll watch it though.

Tyrion related and hung out with and plotted with the lower classes. The Stark kids went off in different directions‚Äî pampered nobility that were suddenly fish out of water. Jon went to the Wall and mixed with many types of characters. It was the mix of characters that made the aSoIaF books and GoT show good.

  
I'm sure they'll throw in some stories of castle staff and other lower class characters. But so far this looks like it's the adventures of a bunch of millionaires and billionaires (relative to our world) and that could get dry pretty quickly.

  
(I'm also in the weirdo minority who doesn't much like the dragons and dragon riding stuff. I love the dark magic that births them in aSoIaF. But then they grow up to be basically titanic lizards. Nothing really magical about them at all. They even need to eat herds of cattle just to survive‚Äîwhich would make them a huge drain on resources. Liabilities.)"
Radio Romance,[deleted]
Radio Romance,"Rolling Stone also panned Led Zeppelin‚Äôs first album, among many other highly acclaimed albums so I‚Äôll just take that one with a grain of salt."
Radio Romance,"I watched every episode of GoT, first because it seemed interesting and then because of its storied beginnings I thought it could somehow redeem itself. What memory offers now is an absolute  grimoire of grisly ideas papered over by the moniker ""fantasy TV"". Women having their babies cut out of their wombs, castration and humiliation, death drowning in molten metal, having to learn to fight through sudden blindness, a talking gallery of decapitated heads, some sort of creeping disease, death by being pulled apart by dogs, being tricked into eating your relative baked into a pie, casual, ritual, near constant rapes. Spoiler -- mostly everybody dies. And then at the end the actors of this monstrosity could barely phone it in and started leaving their coffee cups and water bottles on sets as they were being filmed. 

Doesn't matter what anyone says. \*Never again\*, GoT; over here we finally understood we the audience were being terrorized."
Radio Romance,No more misogyny‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm out
Radio Romance,"Yeah if I got paid to go to the big opening and review I'd say nice shit too, so I could go to the next big opening"
Radio Romance,All the people saying this franchise was dead after season 8 are delusional. Most of the reviews are positive; this show is going to be a *huge* hit.
Radio Romance,"Even negatives seems to be my cup of tea honestly.   


In the end, I'm here for the politicking and dragons and it seems that is what we will get."
Radio Romance,Most of the critics are things specifically said to be about the show (like too many Targaryens lol) and being upset about the things that made GoT great.
Radio Romance,reviews seem solid enough but i feel like there is a gap for rings of power to slide into that could take over the public consciousness.
Radio Romance,"Matt smith has one of the worst faces in Hollywood, and seeing him with that silly wig on he goes from being a 5 or 6 head to being 95% forehead. Not since MTVs the head, has anyone on TV had so much forehead."
Radio Romance,After GoT I honestly can not bother with this show. I stopped the books and can‚Äôt bother with a spin off.
Radio Romance,The show now lies around 85% on RT. Which is good news.
Radio Romance,"Trying‚Ä¶to not‚Ä¶.get‚Ä¶.HYPEEED!!!

But I am now! It‚Äôs too late. Time to pull out The World of Ice & Fire!!"
Radio Romance,"No matter what, I am going to wait for this show to end, even if it is going to be 10 seasons. Only if in the end it will be declared worth watching I am going to. GOT has been such a monumental delusion from season 6 to 8 that I am not risking that waste such a large portion of my life for garbage."
Radio Romance,"Does Matt Smith need to get a new agent? He's finally getting more work after Doctor Who but all as dour characters or villains without personality or at least appearing in movies and tv that's getting shit on for it, minus the Crown, which he was still a Dour Danny in, or Pouting Phillip I guess"
Radio Romance,Would take the guardian review with a grain of salt. Lucy Mangan is incapable of objective critique.
Radio Romance,I cannot fathom why anyone would watch this after HBO fucked up GoT the first time.
Radio Romance,"I just can't be bothered to care even if I wanted to (ABOUT REVIEWS/WATCHING THE SHOW if that wasn't obvious...I obviously care about expressing how I feel about this show). It's a prequel. A prequel to a terrible and worthless ending. Why care? Even if it gets 10/10 all around, it's a pass for me. Sorry.

Not to mention if I watched it, all I'd be thinking about in the back of my mind is the depressing ending. No ty.

[edit]: where were all you downvoting GoT gawkers after the show ended the way it did? lmao.  keep downvoting me for an opinion you know millions of people share."
Radio Romance,Is the show out already? I thought it was airing this Sunday?!?
Radio Romance,Why do these snippets feel like they‚Äôre written with less thought and care than your run-of-the-mill Reddit comment?
Radio Romance,How many episodes did they get to review?
Radio Romance,WE THE FANS ARE SUCKERS. George should have finished wind's of winter before doing any other projects. HBO ruined the ending passing George's progress and before he dies he owes US LOYAL FANS the ending we all know he wants to give us. How much money do you need at 70? The biggest heartbreak will be him not completing his life's work...then what some ghost writer gives us more of the same?  I watched the show. I know the history George outlined in the targaryens lives... I'm like you. A fan. I've read all the books...3000 pages x 5 plus. And I read them 4 times... so enjoy the show.. but don't forget... WE ARE OWED for our loyalty.
Radio Romance,"""Medical Horror"", I agree. What is the point of the super graphic birth? It was a c-section done archaically, we get it, mom and baby die. No need for the overly grotesque? It seriously made me uncomforatble and added nothing to the end result."
Radio Romance,"The premiere of this show was actually serviceably entertaining. In spite of the table conferences of the characters, this show seemed faster-paced than the old show. Maybe it‚Äôs because Benioff and Weiss are no longer involved.

A lot of fans have been miffed with George Martin recently over various things, like not working on the last books of the series and especially over his calling his audience names if they express exasperation with him. But none of that was enough to keep viewers, even the angry ones, away from the premiere, which did very well in the ratings. The bottom line is that people always need something to watch. And I guess they really do go for prequels, because they like stuff they are familiar with. There was never going to be any ‚Äúboycott‚Äù of George Martin. People don‚Äôt really care about entertainment politics, it‚Äôs not important enough to care about. They endlessly gab about it on the Internet, which sometimes makes it seem important. It‚Äôs mostly hot air and venting that doesn‚Äôt reflect reality."
Radio Romance,"The show‚Äôs just trying too hard for nothing. There is sex and gore just to be there, trying to compensate for the drama that the writers cannot create to fill up the time between canon events and dialogue."
Radio Romance,I'm really liking this. First episode was great on my books.  I hope hate doesn't get this cancelled
Radio Romance,House of the Dragons is unbearably boring. I can't stand watching these disgusting Targaryen's bicker back and forth and that's all there is to see folks. BORING
Radio Romance,"One review ‚ÄúSitting around doing nothing‚Äù, another review ‚Äúfast pace‚Äù you can never tell with reviews"
Radio Romance,"I love the politicking of the earlier seasons but they were brilliant because we were invested in Ned Stark, Tyrion, Cersei etc. that it mattered to us. The murder mystery in Season 1, the looming invasion of Stannis on King's Landing, the built up to Red Wedding all worked because we were invested in various players on all sides of the game."
Radio Romance,"Depends how well they establish stakes and the relationships between characters. Having Tywin and Tyrion in the same room was always tense and had me at the edge of my seat.

I‚Äôm very hopeful that they create some compelling characters like the original series"
Radio Romance,Totally agree but it only works if you have characters enjoyable enough to sit around with. The critics complaining about this mostly say the characters are bland as well. Who knows I‚Äôm still excited!
Radio Romance,"Not enough dick jokes. Truly those are a sign of prestige television.

4/10."
Radio Romance,Foundation has Lee Pace sitting around with himself(brothers) and I enjoyed that.
Radio Romance,"Yeah, sign me the fuck up for this"
Radio Romance,The first time watching GOT you don‚Äôt pick up on it. The 2nd time you realize how much info is actually in the ‚Äúsitting down and talking‚Äù scenes
Radio Romance,"Most of the quieter, slower-paced moments from the earlier seasons were character centric, not really expositing about the politics of the realm"
Radio Romance,Tywin & Arya's scene around a table is one of the most memorable highlights of GoT acting that i think of frequently
Radio Romance,"Only if the writing and acting is worth it (which it was in earlier seasons of GoT), otherwise it turns into a boring slog."
Radio Romance,Fuck just recently the best episode of The Sandman (episode 6) waa just people chatting but it was still fascinating.
Radio Romance,"The Small Council ""musical chairs"" scene from Season 3, which is dialogue free until Tyrion shows up, is absolutely brilliant and wordlessly shows the viewer the personalities and characterization of everyone involved."
Radio Romance,"It looks like most of the negative reviews come from people who, for one reason or another, don't like the actual palace intrigue and the politics of GOT and were apparently watching it for different reasons. They're all on a similar line"
Radio Romance,Also the reason I loved shows like Succession. It was all just backstabbing and scheming.
Radio Romance,"Guess they didn't like Mad Men, either? Some of the best TV dramas are ""sitting around tables and talking""."
Radio Romance,"They also call the characters flat but like...it's presumably only the first episode? Probably a lot of time to round them out, the original GoT episode 1 had a lot of flatness as well if I recall correctly."
Radio Romance,These are the people that are constantly on their phone when watching something.
Radio Romance,"Yeah, that was the best part of GOT to me"
Radio Romance,"They need to bring back brothel exposition

They knew these segments could turn off some viewers in GoT so added nudity to keep everyone engaged

Shane they are dialing it back"
Radio Romance,"Right?? I saw that and my reaction was basically the Obi-Wan ""That's...why I'm here"" meme. I was genuinely hoping this series would lean more into the political stuff. If it does then I'm definitely on board."
Radio Romance,The dialog was at it's best in these scenes IMO

Are You Human,"Got here to thanks the recommendation and praise **Halt and Catch Fire**, such underrated show!"
Are You Human,I‚Äôm a couple years late but I‚Äôm just about finished with Dopesick on Hulu. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more enraged at some characters in a series before. Very powerful stuff. Michael Keaton is fantastic.

Are You Human,2nd season of **Perry Mason** Great show.

Are You Human,"Oh man, Bosch is so freakin‚Äô good. On Season 4 episode 8. I advise anyone who judged the show off season 1, to continue. So good.

RIP Lance."
Are You Human,"Ted lasso season 3- loved the first episode of the new season 

Perry Mason season 2- Why is nobody talking about this show?? It is so good and I'm finding season 2 to be really good so far 

The Mandalorian season 3- loving this show 

Star trek Picard season 3- 5 episodes in and this is the best Picard season by far, so engaging with a fascinating plot"
Are You Human,**Swarm**... Oh this show *crazy* crazy
Are You Human,"I watched and loved The Expanse, though the ending was (understandably, given the shortened final season) jarringly abrupt.  Highly recommend it‚Ä¶ great sci fi and political intrigue.

I‚Äôm just getting to the end of the first season of The Leftovers‚Ä¶ Great show but an absolutely torturous watch, if that makes sense.  I feel like I need to chase every episode with something funny or light."
Are You Human,"So what are we all supposed to do this Sunday with no **The Last of Us** and **Succession** still a week away? Interact with our families? Smh

Finished season one of the video game zombie show, almost done with **Poker Face**, keeping up with **Top Chef** (shout-out the two Canadians on this season, both looking strong so far) and **Abbott Elementary**."
Are You Human,"Bit late to the party, but I just discovered how great The Americans is. I decided to give it a go after watching the first season of Perry Mason and being very impressed with Matthew Rhys, glad I did."
Are You Human,"This is an anti-recommendation. I randomly stumbled over a dance choreography reality tv show on Netflix (""Dance 100"") and this show must have some of the most awfully edited performances of all time. Random zooms and close ups, weird and frantic pans and idiotic crowd reaction shots awkwardly put together. The actual dancing seems to have been secondary to whoever edited this thing. 

Add a stage production that at times completely floods the zone with fire balls or flood lights. 

Don't get me started on the rest of the show. What an utter failure lol."
Are You Human,"Watching  shadow and bone.

The writing is still ok but this is a huge letdown from the first season.

The first season actually gave you this brand new universe type feel.......

The second doesnt. Even worse they're plotting out some battle of the ages shit with an extremely more limited cast than the first season.

Idk if it was shot during the pandemic or it was budget cuts or what..

But you cant emphasize some big conflict that is about to occur while never showing more than 15 or 20 ppl on screen at a time.

The first season had literally fields and cities of actors and extras.. you got the feeling you were in  this massive other world which is always part of the appeal to fantasy shows.

This season it's just a large sound stage that can hold 30 to 40 ppl at best. And once you realize how downsized the show is you cant get it out of your mind 

The writing isn't that bad. Tho it does play on some heavily used tropes..the actual story isn't bad. But the show is not even close to what it was the first season"
Are You Human,"Swarm - 2 episodes in, utterly bizarre and I have no idea what I‚Äôm watching but I know I‚Äôll be watching the rest as fast as possible"
Are You Human,"Just binged Yellowjackets s1 in time for season 2 in a few days. It's so bat shit crazy. I loved it. The whole cast is incredible. 

I started The Wire for the first time last week. I'm only a few episodes in and liking it. Not loving it yet.

Doing a catch up on Chicago Fire with s8.  Always have and always will love this show. >!I miss Otis though.!<

Also think I'm going to start Perry Mason. With s3 three starting soon, seems like a good idea.

And watching my weekly shows. The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, Superman & Lois (s3 started this week), Daisy Jones,  Chicago PD and Vanderpump Rules for my reality fix."
Are You Human,Wait when did Star Trek Picard get so good? Last 2 episodes have been 10/10.
Are You Human,"Just finished first episode of Extrapolations. Some thoughts.

Plot is not that interesting or exciting. A little preachy. 

Matthew Rhys and Heather Graham kill it in this episode. So fun to watch both of them ! 

I really do not recognize Kit Harington. Are we sure he is the same guy who plays Jon snow? Ok this is a joke but really he look so different.

I am guessing they paid BIG bucks for so many people to come on to the show.

I will continue watching."
Are You Human,Star Trek Picard Season 3 is great so far!
Are You Human,"**The Last of Us** S1 - great drama set in a horror / dystopian setting. Maizin is amazing. Pascual & Ramsey are gonna get the emmys for this, and hopefully Nick Offerman for guest star. 

**Only Murders in the Building** S1 & S2 - delightful binge. It has that movie magic twinkle, excited for S3 with Meryl Streep. This is a really brilliant move for Selena's career, as she plays a voice of a (true crime) generation character. 

**Alaska Daily** - bold opening. Hillary Swank headlines this but the rest of the cast hold their own and are quite charming. It's a decent newsroom drama in a time where trust on the media is contentious."
Are You Human,"Pretty Mason S1. 

Shadow & Bone S2. 

Warrior S1. 

His Dark Materials S3. 

A Spy Among Friends. 

The Bureau. 

12 monkeys. 

Dark. 

Just finished all the seasons to The Boys,  The Last of Us, and both seasons of Slow Horses.  All great shows"
Are You Human,"The first episode of **Class of '07** was hilarious. An apocalypse hits an aussie girls' school reunion. Great cast, super witty writing, it's on Prime, watch it!"
Are You Human,Pretty excited about lucky hank.  New party down is great.
Are You Human,"Highly recommend Swarm on Prime. It‚Äôs crazy, unnerving, and has plenty of twists. I can‚Äôt remember the last time a show sucked me in this fast"
Are You Human,"Rewatching **House M.D**, after so many years it still holds up amazingly. Hugh Laurie is an incredible actor. Even though it has 20+ episodes a season, I'm not tired of it(into season 4). One of my favourite shows of all time.

I have also been watching alot of Korean Shows(The Glory, My Name, HellBound, All of Us Are Dead etc). I tried to watch  **Vincenzo** and could not get into it, reminded me of a cheesy CW show. The most off putting and annoying thing was that main character constantly had his face brightened by 1000%? I don't understand that."
Are You Human,"**Poker Face**--  I'm 6 episodes in, and it is okay.  I don't mind knowing the killer in the beginning a la Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent.  But I do wish there was more detective work to get there.  It's hard to put my finger on it but I just don't think Natasha Lyonne carries it.  

**Perry Mason**-- I loved the first season and so far the second season is good too.  I love watching period pieces."
Are You Human,"About to start **Shirking** because I've been reading a lot of good things about the show here. Better nor disappoint!

At the third episode of **Alice in Borderland**. It's okay, a tad bit over the top with action sequence, too exaggerated and sometimes the scenes and dialogues are way too long for the context.

Excited to watch **Shadow and Bones**, waited on this show for a long time.

Discontinued **Carnival Row** after first episode (Season one) due to many mixed reviews for season two. Amazon has done a unique job ruining three fantasy shows. I have a feeling that **Warhammer** could be a change that Amazon needs now that Henry Cavill is on it.

*TLOU*, I LOVED IT!"
Are You Human,I assumed Succession S4 was premiering tonight since TLoU ended‚Ä¶ F Me!
Are You Human,"Some of these weekly TV shows have become my main coping mechanism for such a stressful few weeks in the rest of life. It‚Äôs nice to escape to both new and familiar worlds. I‚Äôm overly positive on these shows because, well, life is tough right now and these help me through it.

**Star Trek Picard** continues to be fantastic. It gets better each and every episode - and last week‚Äôs was a banger! No spoilers - but if you loved TNG this season is wonderful.

**The Mandalorian** felt a lot like Andor this week. I really enjoyed the whole middle of the episode - it was some great, new world building - but I missed seeing Mando during it. The beginning scenes were some of the best I‚Äôve seen!

**The Bad Batch** was a really nice feel good episode. I‚Äôm enjoying our heroes learning about what life should be like. And completely expecting that to be ripped away.

**Ted Lasso** is back! And I can‚Äôt wait to see where this season takes Richmond and Ted. Up the Greyhounds!

Binged the last 5 episodes of **The Last of Us**. Some of these episodes could have been a whole season for The Walking Dead. I‚Äôm impressed with how much they‚Äôre able to focus on moving the plot forward while creating a compelling apocalyptic world - and building these character‚Äôs relationship. The jump between episodes 8 & 9 was a little abrupt but overall a great new show!

**Shadow & Bone** took a while for me to remember the first season. But this is a great show that my wife and I can enjoy watching together. I need a good recap of season 1 though."
Are You Human,Lucky Hank was decent. Not jaw dropping or anything but looked like a quality show that I expect to watch every week.
Are You Human,Just gonna say RIP Lance Reddick. Just finished binging **BOSCH**. Weekend ruined. Fucking po-lice
Are You Human,"I'll watch the final episode of The Last Of Us with my family this weekend. Excited to see it!

I also plan on binging the second season of Shadow and Bone on Netflix. The series is based on the Shadow and Bone trilogy by Leigh Bardugo. It is part-fantasy, part-drama, and part-adventure.

It's been a while since I've read the trilogy, which is a part of a whole fantasy universe called the Grishaverse (besides the S&B trilogy, it also covers two duologies). But both the book and TV series really remind me of Avatar: The Last Airbender (elemental magic), Game of Thrones (different nations and political intrigue), and Ocean's 11 (heists). So if you like any of these things, consider giving Shadow and Bone a try. Note that it is an adaptation of a young adult novel, so expect a little bit of romance and awkward (sometimes cringe-worthy) fantasy dialogue."
Are You Human,"*Class of ‚Äò07*

Really fun and entertaining ensemble comedy with an interesting premise and a great cast"
Are You Human,"Droppin a show in surprised I've never seen mentioned here before. 

Mr. Mercedes.. has many things in common with a lot of the shows ppl mention here.

Its based on Stephen king material.

First season is very much a very good crime drama but as it goes on shit gets very weird.  It is king after all.. but very good crime / thriller with sci fi elements that play our later.

Think it was originally on peacock and no idea where to find if now other than the skull and crossbones route.

Either way pretty interesting show. Great cast . With enough wtf weird shit to keep you interested.

A bit like You + mr robot + any good detective show.

Cast is kinda low key but some excellent work gets done. Especially Brendan Gleeson"
Are You Human,"RIP to Lance Reddick üôèüèº

Broyles from Fringe, if you don‚Äôt know him by name"
Are You Human,_Shrinking_ might have the most likeable characters of any show I've seen. There is no B-plot. Each character is funny and charming in their own way.
Are You Human,"**Poker Face** \- up to Ep 8 - I really like it - an episode every few days.  Lots of great guest stars. 

**Clarkson's Farm** S2 - Jeremy and Kaleb are hilarious Frick and Frack.  I love the cast of side characters.  Cows!

**Pretty Hard Cases** S3 - it can be a little cringey, but I've loved the character development between Kelly and Sam.  And I like how they unfold the police investigations over the season.

Hate-watching **Inventing Anna** because I needed something purely trashy that I had downloaded when there was a 5 hour internet outage here.  I'll likely finish it out.  I'm intrigued by some of the supporting cast.  I didn't realize it was a Shonda show until I started into it.

Finishing up **All Creatures Great and Small** S3.  Not my favourite of the seasons with TB and WW2 both at play - but still wonderful characters and scenery.  

Next up - **Shrinking**."
Are You Human,"Binged all of Swarm tonight, I loved the first 5 episodes, not sure on the last two at the moment. Really good soundtrack."
Are You Human,"Started Star Trek: Strange New Worlds on a whim after not really watching any trek since TNG and I‚Äôm absolutely blown away so far. It weirdly reminds me a lot of The Orville, which I always loved for feeling like classic trek but with a modern look, which is exactly what Strange New Worlds is but better and more serious."
Are You Human,"Binged Swarm, and it gave me nightmares üòÖ"
Are You Human,"Watching s2 of Ted Lasso and I love it. While watching the Emmys last year, without having seen s2 of Ted Lasso, I thought it was sacrilegious that Barry s3 lost to it. However, now that I've seen most of it, I can see why it won. I still think s3 of Barry is better, but this show/season is great without a doubt."
Are You Human,"**Swarm** has been a *very* pleasant treat! 4 episodes in and im absolutely in love with the show‚Äôs vibe

The story is dark and can be pretty intense at times, and i love how it just keeps getting more deranged, hope it keeps that up to the end!

Whatever film or lighting they‚Äôre using gives every shot a very nostalgic feel for me. The cinematography is great, and i really like the odd ratio it‚Äôs filmed in. Never seen it before.

Also it‚Äôs one of those shows that has the logo in a different texture every episode, and that‚Äôs something that always puts a stupid grin on my face

EDIT: Just finished the show. Oh my *god*, what an ending!!! One of the better shows ive seen in the past year. They stretched the show‚Äôs concept in ways i wouldnt have ever expected and it was incredible. Definitely give this one a watch if the trailer interests you at all"
Are You Human,"You could argue that it has its flaws but I have been absolutely loving the new season of Party Down. 

The most recent episode with >!Henry tripping out on mai tais and peoples shirts had me cracking up!< 

I can't believe there's only two episodes left. Please watch it. I can't handle this show being cancelled again."
Are You Human,swarm might not be amazing but it‚Äôs so unique and different i love it
Are You Human,"It's a bit confusing that with The Swarm and Swarm we have two (very different) shows out right now.

Anyways, while Glover's Swarm got lukewarm reviews, stylistically the first episode has me intrigued."
Are You Human,"**Star Trek: Picard** has been so good so far this season. I know people were burned by the first two seasons, and I get it, but hear me out. There's a new showrunner that actually knows how to do proper TV sci fi (Terry Matalas), the balance between fan service and actually telling a good story is great, they're taking the lore and the characters seriously and everyone seems to be having so much fun. The last 3 eps especially have been incredible Star Trek and incredible sci fi, you can really feel the stakes and what the characters are going through. 

And, without spoiling anything, it's going places that are really surprising and interesting. I saw someone on twitter call this season Star Trek >!Among Us but with changelings!< and that stuck with me, spot on description lol.

And the way they've actually held back on a lot of the fan service is impressive. We're halfway through the season and only now did >!Picard and Riker get a hold of Worf. No Geordi yet either, or whomever Spiner's going to be portraying this time.!<

They could still bungle it, but if the second half of the season keeps up this pace I say give Matalas the keys to the franchise, let him do whatever he wants in this era of Trek. A USS Titan series with Shaw as the Captain and Seven as the first officer, maybe?"
Are You Human,Class of 07. Is fucking great
Are You Human,"These two new
Amazon series are legit bingeworthy.

**Swarm** - some twisted, fever dream like show. Good and different.

**Class of 07** - Endearing with an ensemble cast that worked quite well. Laid back, entertaining watch that produced quite a few laughs."
Are You Human,"Watching second season of Slow Horses, so good!"
Are You Human,"Well I finished the Last of Us. Never played the game but I more or less know the story and decided to give the show a shot and I loved it. Especially Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship in the series. 


After finishing that show, I decided to watch the first two Creed movies on HBO since I just watched the 3rd film two weeks ago and I loved both films."
Are You Human,"Currently binging Regular show damn i miss the show.

I'm loving Perry Mason s2 so much i think its better than s1. Are you guys watching ?

Also unfortunately dropped Hello tomorrow, i wanted  it to be good but it lost me. Dropping Mando s3 until the season is done it has lost me ngl."
Are You Human,"Watching **The Old Man**.

Only two episodes in, but I‚Äôm finding it a surprisingly refreshing take on the ‚Äúold guy has to return to his life of violence‚Äù genre. More nuanced than I expected, with good performances from the cast."
Are You Human,"My Name (Netflix) - Just finished this great and criminally overlooked series yesterday! Nearly perfect action and mystery series. 

FROM (MGM+... formerly Epix) - Cool puzzle box of a series that will have you looking up Norse Runes and mythical creatures trying to figure out what the hell is going on. It's great for inspiring audience engagement and the subreddit is fun for looking at theories.

Are You Human,"I have a busy weekend ahead! Watching The White Lotus for the first time. Almost done with season 1.

I'm intrigued by Swarm on Amazon Prime, so I'll watch that this weekend too.

Then Shadow and Bone and the latest two episodes of Abbott Elementary for something light!

(I'm also behind on The Good Doctor...but that's because I'm a completionist and I have to see the series through)"
Are You Human,"Does anyone have recommendations for shows like Daisy Jones and The Six?

I like the whole drama / romance going between Daisy and Billy . Doesn't necessarily have to be about musicians just the drama."
Are You Human,"The Other Two.
There‚Äôs two seasons with the third coming out in May and am mad I‚Äôm just hearing about it but glad it‚Äôs still going"
Are You Human,"Oh man‚Ä¶ missing a Good Friday night premiere‚Ä¶ got spoiled by Sundays **The Last of Us**, Mondays **Perry Mason**, Tuesdays **Ted Lasso**, Wednesdays **Mandalorian**, Thursday‚Äôs **Shrinking**. Any Good Friday night must watch? 

Looking forward to **Happiness** and **Succession** on Sunday."
Are You Human,"I have been re watching Fringe for the past month, felt like not too long ago I finished up Vox Machina, and my older brother just beat Horizon. So Lance Reddick has been brought up a lot. Really sad to hear, though I know I won't forget about him anytime soon"
Are You Human,"Watching Extrapolations. Without spoiling anything, I'd rate it either 6 or 7 out of 10 so far. And its message about climate chane is roughly as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, so if you find heavy handed morals off-putting it may not be the show for you. Though for this case there's a good argument the heavy handedness is justified."
Are You Human,"5 episodes into S2 of Justified and I'm loving it! Highly recommend this show! 

I somehow gotta complete this before City Primeval arrives."
Are You Human,"despite all the uncertainty that I feel about Swarm, it's very bingeable. 7.5/10"
Are You Human,"**Ted Lasso**- season 3 - So glad its back, don't see what all the griping is about, solid episode I don't see any fall off in quality. 

OK - one gripe, Keeley and Roy breakup seems pretty transparently there because its likely an easy way to create drama for them to ultimately get back together. But the scene with his niece was still beautifully done.

Nathan is such a great foil for Ted - am really interested to see how this all plays out.

**Picard** add me to the pile of those who say this show is really really good this season and each episode seems to get even better.(SPOILERISH)  Was great to see Michelle Forbes again - really missed her character when she was written out of TNG

**Abbott Elementary** - Gold star to them for doing gods work and taking on the whole issue of Charter Schools - something rarely addressed in the media in anything but glowing terms."
Are You Human,"I really enjoyed **Swarm.**  Darkly comedic and creepy, and really nails the obsessive stan behavior I've seen on social media."
Are You Human,"**Watching**: *Daisy Jones and the Six* S.L, *Extrapolations* S.L, *The Mandalorian* S.3, *Party Down* S.3, *Perry Mason* S.2, *Rain Dogs* S.1, *Shrinking* S.1, & *Snowfall* S.6 

**Finished**: *The Last of Us* S.1 (**A**) & *Servant* S.4 (**B-**) 

**Dropped** (for now; will finish when I've got more time): *Dear Edward*, *Hello Tomorrow!*, *History of the World: Part II*, *Liasion*, & *Truth Be Told*"
Are You Human,**School Spirits** is a lot better than I expected. Mystery show where the detective is a murdered high school student. I was hooked right at the ending of episode 1.
Are You Human,Shadow and Bone season 2
Are You Human,"Watched the new show on The CW, 'Gotham Knights'... it sucks. The network won't be the same this time next year.  I'm genuinely surprised they renewed 'All American'.

'Gotham Knights', 'Kung Fu', 'Walker: Independence', 'All American: Homecoming', 'Superman & Lois' and 'The Winchesters' are definitely getting canned.

'Riverdale', 'The Flash' and 'Nancy Drew' are ending after their next seasons.

The only other thing that might survive the death of scripted programming on The CW is 'Walker'."
Are You Human,"What was that German/International scifi show that had some sort of aquatic alien intelligence and crab pandemic? The trailer was posted here awhile ago, but I forgot the title."
Are You Human,"Would you all recommend Sucession or Ozark first?? I'm probably going to start one thus week, and I'm a bit indecisive on which one, lol"
Are You Human,"Just watched **The Last of Us** finale and there isn't really that much to say other than I loved it all. I guess the only downside is that some of the episodes are so incredibly good that the not-quite-as-good episodes feel bad in comparison, when they're really not. I thought episode three was emotionally devastating in the best way possible and I love when a show or movie has that much effect on me. For me it's worthy to be on the short list of 10 out of 10 shows. It does enough for me.

I also finally got around to watching all of **Ted Lasso**, which I had been putting off for a bit because I was ""saving it"". Like... I knew it was going to be good so I didn't want to rush it. I'm a bit weird that way. I'd put it alongside all of the other (fairly) recent feel-good comedies like Parks and Rec, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place, Schitt's Creek, and Superstore. It's like 95% good vibes. I had only seen clips of it and I was a bit concerned the humor wasn't going to land for me. That was partially true. I didn't find it uproariously funny, but I found it humorous and had some good laughs. I found the ratio of story/drama to comedy similar to The Good Place, which totally works for me. On a personal note, I never really like Jason Sudeikis all that much, but I enjoy him much more as a relatable character than his normal kind-of-a-dick roles."
Are You Human,"Almost done re-watching **The Peripheral** and finding it really rewarding. The writing is so tight, every scene and the dialogue is all there for a reason and ties together even if some of it connects much later on. I know the show has gotten pushback from fans of the book bc they changed much of the plot, but as someone who‚Äôs favorite writer is Gibson and favorite book is Neuromancer I‚Äôm telling you try giving it another shot with an open mind. They stay so true to the core characters (the Flynn-Burton dynamic is right out the book) and they pull off the world-building so well. The ideas are all there too. 

I also think they do a good job mirroring his writing style, one hallmark of which is to just drop you in running with no handholding whatsover. Fast paced with so much happening it can take time to understand how the threads fit, but all there for a reason. I suspect they knew that wouldn‚Äôt be for everyone and I think it‚Äôs pretty cool they did it anyway."
Are You Human,Finished **The Americans** Season 1 and I understand the hype now. The quality already feels like Breaking Bad/The Sopranos tier. Just great writing/directing/acting across the board.

Are You Human,"The Stand 1994 or 2020, which one to watch?"
Are You Human,"Just finished **The Consultant** on Amazon Prime.  Was very honestly sincerely surprised to see that it was based on a Bentley Little book; tried to get into him when he first started out and his writing was such an obvious and transparent aping of Stephen King's style that I gave up after two books:  ""The Town"" which had a boy jerking off in his sister's panties, and ""The Store"" which had a father fucking his daughter, and both with abrupt shitty endings, just like King.  I was so sure that by episode 3 we'd discover that Mama Sang while her Baby Yodeled down there, but fortunately the source material didn't seem to go that direction -- but the ending still sucked and was abrupt.  I honestly don't know why I voluntarily finished a show adapted from a third-tier King wannabe, but I'm glad to confirm and validate my previous criticisms of the author.

Also, in episode 4, the soundtrack that played during the timelapse of Waltz in the waiting area sounded so very suspiciously similar to [this bop by 9 Lazy 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrn-kwtEhUg) that I had to pause and look up the music credits.  Didn't see them listed, so it's either an oversight or the ""original music composer"" thought they could get away with a little motif plagiarism."
Are You Human,"This week I have watched:

**Dark Winds** - what brought me to this series was, of course, Zahn McClarnon and I did enjoy his acting and a detective story on ass end of nowhere in Indian reservation seemed like a fascinating idea, but overall the series was all over the place. It seems like they had concepts for 5 seasons but decided to smash it all into one series of 6 episodes. Overall it was very cluttered and increasingly ridiculous. It also had some themes that seemed important, like native beliefs - especially around witchcraft, that went completely nowhere. Most egregious example of this is the character of the witch who, for no clear reason, was aligned with the bandits and she did not even have a single sentence to speak. Overall, at best it was mediocre. If it returns in S2 I will give it a chance, but if writers don't improve I will drop it.

**The Devil's Hour** - fascinating, weird and really fucking dark mini series with Peter Capaldi as a serial killer. It really stuck my vibe. Definitely recommend.

**The Consultant** - after learning that the show has Christoph Waltz as one of main characters I expected much more from it. I don't know the book it adapts so cannot comment on how faithful it is, but the show seemed very confused about its own story and did not seem to know what to do. They set up the mystery of Regus Patoff but did not really pursue it in any meaningful way and did not resolve it, they set up the theme of his corrupting influence and ruthless corporate politics but barely showed anything, they went for some themes of company doing illegal shit but never went anywhere with it or showed any consequences for those actions. Overall, I was disappointed."
Are You Human,Started OUTLAST on Netflix and wound up cranking through it in one day. A survival competition where people need to survive each other. Kind of shows the best and worst of human nature.
Are You Human,I haven't seen it mentioned on Reddit at all but there is a new Canadian series called *Shelved*. It's a bit like Superstore but it's the employees at a Library. It's only 2 episodes in so far but I've enjoyed them and think it has a lot of potential.
Are You Human,"Just finished **The Legend of Korra** and it was pretty good. It had higher highs than the original **Avatar** but lower lows and lower mediums. Of all the widely beloved shows this more than most lends itself to a relaunch and adding more seasons. Simply a new Avatar is born and take it from there. Wonder why there are no new seasons given how popular the show is and how obsessed studios are with relaunching very popular ip.

Watched season one of **Vinland Saga** and it was great. Season two is so much worse. I feel cheated."
Are You Human,"Any recs for a new show for my wife and I?

Most recently we‚Äôve watched:
The Morning Show
Curb Your Enthusiasm
Shameless (a rewatch for her)
Barry
Ozark (final season, watched all basically as it would get released.)

She watches way more TV than I do, it‚Äôs less my go-to medium, but I do like having something in rotation for us to share. She enjoys a lot of reality TV and the dramas or thrillers on Netflix. I‚Äôm open to those shows, but typically don‚Äôt gravitate towards them on my own. She prefers live action and contemporary, nothing really sci-fi or fantasy.

EDIT: Also looking to avoid anything with significant cancer storylines right now.

We have Netflix, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Disney+ currently.

Anything based on some of this info would be greatly appreciated!!"

Are You Human,Swarm on Amazon is WILD & so good.
Are You Human,My girlfriend and I are on season 2 of Doom Patrol. it's a pretty fun and entertaining show even though we both frequently wonder what the heck is going on.  Sometimes we think that's the point. Definitely one of the better DC Comics shows!
Are You Human,Writers strike might be coming so we might have nothing to watch soon and can catch up on older series or do rewatch.
Are You Human,"Currently watching

The Leftovers- having seen this recommended many times on here I finally gave it a shot. Through episode 3 so far with the last episode being the best. Honestly if I hadn‚Äôt read so many comments about how good this show is I‚Äôd give up. So far it‚Äôs extremely bleak and all the characters I could care less about. I‚Äôm hopeful that will change.

Abbot Elementary - up to date on the show. I find episodes hit or miss. It‚Äôs a quick show however and a nice cleanse after a leftovers episode.

Welcome to Wrexham- just generally enjoyable to watch. Reynolds and McElHenney are just comedy together.

Derry Girls - 2 episodes left and I‚Äôll be caught up. Love this show! Great comedy and cast. Definitely a recommend for anyone looking for a good short comedy.

Finished

Last of Us - loved this series. Felt at times it was rushed and could have really benefited from going to 10 epsiodes and building more with Joel and Ellie especially after episode 8. And was surprised how few scenes included Infected, especially in the back half.  Episode 1 and 3 are probably 2 of my favorite episodes of television ever.

Mad Men S6 - while still a great show I found season 6 to be not as enjoyable as previous seasons with less highs than the others.¬†

What We Do in the Shadows - every episode is good for some great laughs. Nandor is my MVP of the latest episode"
Are You Human,Was not a fan of **The Mandalorian** season 3 episode 3

Are You Human,Anyone checked new series with Bob Odenkirk yet?  Lucky Hank it's called
Are You Human,"***Ted Lasso (season 3)*** Great show and delivers. However, I feel the episodes length should go back down to 35 minutes as I feel the show will get a bit repetitive if each episode is an hour long.

**Hello Tomorrow** Very bland and predictable still watching it to see where it goes    but I'm expecting it to be cancelled.

**History of the World part II** Some of the sketches are quite good but a few sketches like Shirley and The Russian Revolution (post Jack Black singing as Stalin) are dragging on a bit too long."
Are You Human,"I just started Agent Elvis which is a very weird Archer Fever dream feeling show with Elvis as a secret agent?

Swarm, which is basically if Beyonc√©‚Äôs number one fan became a murderous psycho?? It‚Äôs also very weird üòÇ 

And Succession which I hope lands it‚Äôs big final season!"
Are You Human,"I'm enjoying the new Top Chef. It's cool to see ""all stars"" from international shows and the challenges are harder since they're winners and finalists."
Are You Human,rewatching please like me. probably my third time over the years and god this show is just perfect.
Stone Age,Sounds like a hell of a show for the prison.
Stone Age,I hope that Queens live album from the prison actually comes out
Stone Age,I love Jeselnik for being an ¬´edgy¬ª comedian who doesn‚Äôt spend his time shitting all over social justice.

Stone Age,Also not available on LG TVs.
Stone Age,"It's the same in all the other European markets, I've been saying this from day one if they don't offer the same quality level the other streaming services provide, and that's 4K Dolby Vision or at least HDR10 and Dolby Atmos for sound, then they're not getting my money."
Stone Age,It's almost 2023. All streaming services have to offer it by default specially their original content. There is basically no content being recorded nowadays in 1080p or less the fact that they do it is just because they feel they can cut costs there.
Stone Age,I'm in the States and Paramount + is such a crappy app.  Constantly buffering and freezing.
Stone Age,It‚Äôs a shit app and doesn‚Äôt even have Yellowstone. You have to get some paramount network bullshit through a tv provider. Oh but they have the two spin-offs! So absolutely wack and that‚Äôs not even talking about performance issues and the overall lack of quality content.
Stone Age,Is that just in Germany because I have it on my lg?
Stone Age,"yeah, they know they screwed up selling the US rights of Yellowstone to Peacock before Paramount+ became a thing. fwiw, in other places, the show, including episodes from the current season, is on Paramount+.

the apps are pretty universally bad on every platform i‚Äôve used it on, though it seems weird that 4K/HDR and Atmos aren‚Äôt available in some regions apparently. if it‚Äôs in the US, i‚Äôd figure the same content would be available with this formats elsewhere"
Stone Age,Maybe. I cannot find it on my lg
Stone Age,"Same in the UK as well, so its at least Europe wide. It does work through the Amazon Prime app as a channel though."
Stone Age,Would you rather fight a Winston-sized Peacemaker or a Peacemaker-sized Winston?
Stone Age,"Oh hey didnt realise this was happening(?). Thoughts on working with Gunn and the rest of the team?

If you could work any adaptation or particular project. what would it be?

Peacemaker and TSS are great awesome.The Peacesquad are all very well developed too."
Stone Age,Do you really wanna taste it?
Stone Age,How was filming the dance number intro? It looks like it was hilarious
Stone Age,"Thank you for doing this AMA! I have a couple of questions for sure!

1. What is your favorite episode of Peacemaker? If your favorite episode is already out, why is that one your favorite?

2. How did James pitch you the character of John Economos?

3. What have been the biggest inspirations to you during your career?

Thanks a ton!"
Stone Age,"Screw it, let's start a few minutes early."
Stone Age,"Does Gunn's directing and writing allow you moments to improvise some lines or shots? If yes, can you talk about one?"
Stone Age,"Favorite memories from New girl?
What do you think Outside Dave's been up to?"
Stone Age,"Have you considered trying to sell your own brand of beard dye? I would re-grow my beard and use it, and I can't believe I am alone in that."
Stone Age,"What's it like going from occasional recurring character (possibly just 1 off guest spot), to a secondary main cast character in Superstore? Did you just keep getting more lines written or was there some formal thing where they told you they were making you a bigger character in the show? Isaac and Marcus killed every scene they were in and you definitely became on of my favorites as Superstore went on."
Stone Age,"OK folks, I have to run to another interview. I had a blast and tried to get to as many questions as I could. Thanks for dropping by and catch a new episode of Peacemaker this Thursday. HBOMax.

FYI, this week's episode was directed by the great Jody Hill! 

PEACE(MAKER) OUT! 
S."
Stone Age,How did you end up in the recurring role on You're the Worst?
Stone Age,Who is your favorite character and why is it Eagly
Stone Age,"What was your day to day like when working on Peacemaker ? 

What kind of Complication did Covid Cause during shooting ? 

Also your character is so great ! Let's get you and Batmite a spin off !"
Stone Age,What aspects of Economos are closest to your real personality and what's your internal story for how he ended up working for Waller?
Stone Age,"I'm beginning to have white spots on my beard. Which products do you recommend, cause yours looks nice."
Stone Age,Is a season 2 in the works?
Stone Age,Did you ever find out if pee-pee was a write off?
Stone Age,"I Know TSSP was forever  ago, but do people still get you and Brian Posehein confused? Because I'm sorry, but I just can't separate you two in My brain."
Stone Age,"If you had to pick one pasta noodle to eat for the rest of your life, what would it be?

Also, I belly laughed at the whole identity mix up in episode 2 of Peacemaker, you were hilarious - I needed that, Thank you!"
Stone Age,I'm rating this post five meowmeowbeenz
Stone Age,Why do you dye your beard?
Stone Age,"Hey Steve, known of you since Channel 101 and TSSP. Nothing I can think of to ask, but hearing of what happened with Officer Jay is .. lame. I loved the TSSP show back when there wasn't any gay characters like that on tv (even if it was meant as sort of a joke how un gay they were, it still felt like representation)

Do you actually drink TAB?

Good luck with ~~Snowpiercer~~ Peacemaker"
Stone Age,"Nice job with Judomaster. Clean take-down.

What is it like on set? I'm loving the serious but silly tone of the show."
Stone Age,What's the best QOTSA song and why is it Song for the Dead?
Stone Age,"I heard your beard died.  Condolences.

Edit: typo"
Stone Age,"Hey Steve,loved your work in the peacemaker,TSS. 
What was your favourite scene to do in the peacemaker"
Stone Age,"Hey Steve, big fan. I've always been a fan of yours since the Sarah Silverman Program, that show meant a lot to me. As a slightly overweight gay guy big into Gaming, Horror, n Nerd shit, I kinda just want to say thank you for depicting a homosexual couple that I could actually identify with. It always bothered me when I was that age, when I kinda knew what I was but still confused. Actually seeing people like me with my interests who were also just gay and that wasn't their entire character trait, or a punchline, helped me figure stuff out, it genuinely meant a lot to me. 

With all the sappy stuff's over onto my question lol. I was just curious, and this is more about the suicide squad, since you were the onset actor for king shark I always wondered if all his dialogue was actually said by you on set. Did you really act the part or was it more of a stand in thing. Like were you actually doing the lines that James Gunn wrote, he directed you, and then Stallone just ADRed over it or  was there improv involved with the character while filming. Always been interested in the use of fully CGI characters, especially when you get an actual actor to do it on set."
Stone Age,What is the character John Economos‚Äôs favorite band?
Stone Age,How does James Gunn have such an amazing taste in music?
Stone Age,My wife recently lost her dad. I am trying to be as supportive as possible and looking for tips on how you would have liked someone to help you during your loss.
Stone Age,"Hey Steve, you‚Äôre hilarious in the show. What was the funniest interaction on set (that ain‚Äôt a spoiler)?"
Stone Age,"If you could only listen to one song for the rest of your life, what would it be? And Spin Doctors' ""Two Princes"" is already taken."
Stone Age,"Will we see Economos in any other DC Films or TV Shows aside from ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeacemaker‚Äù?
Sort of like how Emilia Harcourt is meant to be in the upcoming ‚ÄúBlack Adam‚Äù Film"
Stone Age,"Very brave stance on kidney stones. But seriously how was doing that crazy intro?

Peacemaker has been pretty great so far but seriously, who goes into someone‚Äôs house and eats their 4 year old olives?"
Stone Age,What was the process like for filming the whole dance sequence in the opening credits?
Stone Age,Would you star in a commercial for Touch of grey hair dye?
Stone Age,What was it like working with Freddie Stroma? So far he (Vigilante) is stealing the show for me.
Stone Age,"You used to do a recurring bit on your IG (which everyone should check out--Steve is an **amazing** photographer), camped out front of spot called Baba Ganoush. Do you still eat there? I'm guessing you had work in the neighborhood?

Anyways, this wasn't *really* a good question. I really enjoyed, in the end of the series, how earnest you got about supporting the plucky, independent restaurant. It tickled me pink.

When you get time, I hope you stop by Nerd Poker's table, again. So happy for you and your successes!"
Stone Age,"Woah Steve, Hold The Line: As a fan of the series Yacht Rock, and your sweet turn as Steve Porcaro, do you have any fond stories from the shoot?"
Stone Age,Do you dye your beard?
Stone Age,What‚Äôs your favorite emergency room in the greater LA area? I live in Calabasas area so any close to me that I could check out?
Stone Age,"Hi Steve, so which did you like more, acting as John Economos or being the motion stand-in for King Shark? What are your personal pros and cons for each of them?"
Stone Age,"I‚Äôm loving the music in Peacemaker, as I didn‚Äôt know a lot of glam metal. What sort of music did James Gunn play on set of SS and Peacemaker to set the mood?"
Stone Age,What's your favorite kind of pizza?
Stone Age,How long did it take to prepare and shoot the Peacemaker intro?
Stone Age,"Any lines from the 3 episodes or the new one that were improvised? 

Who improvised most on set ?"
Stone Age,"Hi Steve! I recently did a rewatch of New Girl, and your character made me laugh out loud every time you were on screen. Do you have any fun memories of working on that show?"
Stone Age,Should I text you whenever go number 1 or 2?
Stone Age,How many seasons do you think the show is gonna have? How many seasons do you think a show like Peacemaker should have? What was doing the Intro like?
Stone Age,Weasel spin-off when?
Stone Age,Actual question: When are you going to do a gallery show/book/whatever with your photography?  Don't be all falsely modest n' shit.  You've got a great eye.
Stone Age,How are your weekends holding up what with the whole Dracula thing? Any improvements?
Stone Age,Why do you dye your beard?
Stone Age,Hi Steve. What‚Äôs the coolest part of being on Peacemaker? Would you ever work with any of the cast again? Are you single?
Stone Age,"hey Agee, hope alls well. Do you think you'd be able to convince Dan to bring back Harmontown? We(I) need it, I dont think its coincidence the world went to shit as soon as it ended."
Stone Age,I know you enjoy photography and your work in that realm has been really great. Would you ever want to DP a project if the chance arose?
Stone Age,"When filming on set, how often do you improvise your lines? Do you just go with what comes naturally once the cameras starts rolling? I heard there‚Äôs not as many ‚Äòfucks‚Äô in the script as there are that come out of John Economos‚Äô mouth ü§£"
Stone Age,"How much does James refer to the source material? Are there any suicide squad runs you recommend (if you‚Äôre a comic book fan)?

How did the beard dye joke come into fruition? Was it because James asked you how you dye it"
Stone Age,Hi! I loved Superstore and was sorry it was canceled. Any funny stories?
Stone Age,"Loved that you and Brian both showed up in Reno 911 QAnon special, given the history of the show, how much of your lines were improvised? any lines that stick out to you in particular?"
Stone Age,"Hey Steve, didn't know you were big into photography, your work is great. Did you take any photos while working on Peacemaker?"
Stone Age,"Hi! You were in one of my favorite shows, Speechless! I know you were only in it very briefly but what was the set like?"
Stone Age,"Hey Steve, I'm your height. Where do you buy shirts? Even tall sizes end up making me look like Britney Spears after a single wash (bare midriff).

Also, have you tried stretchy belts? These things are great.
https://www.beltoutlet.com/collections/mens-stretch-belts"
Stone Age,"Hi Steve! Been a fan for a long time and always love to see you show up in movies and tv shows!

Will we ever see more advertisements for Baba Ganoush?"
Stone Age,"Hello, Are there any characters that you would like to see from the comics in a James Gunn DC product? besides Bat-mite!"
Stone Age,"Hi Steve! I love the show so far, especially your character. Was there anything challenging about the role you didn‚Äôt expect going in? And do you have a favorite episode of the season?"
Stone Age,"Hi Steve it‚Äôs my cat‚Äôs birthday can you send me your social security number and credit card info?
Also I loved your performance as hit character Dude #1 in Hit and Run"
Stone Age,How did you get into acting being such a weirdo?
Stone Age,Where can we get your awesome EP you put out and what else can you tell us about it?
Stone Age,"What are a few of the most surprising, to us at least, professional goals you secretly still hope to achieve?"
Stone Age,Were there any great moments from the first three episodes of Peacemaker that were improvised on set?
Stone Age,"Did you really do the mo-cap for King shark? If so, did you get to work with stallone to develop the dialog or was that all decided in the script and stallone just came in to record voice work?"
Stone Age,How often do you have to re-dye your beard?
Stone Age,"Hey man! I'm loving Peacemaker so far and I can't wait for more. I know you are a musician, What is your go to instrument?"
Stone Age,"Hey Steve! Thanks for doing this. You‚Äôve been one of my favorite parts of the show so far. 

Did you ever get to improvise on set or were things pretty tightly scripted? 

Is there any type of role / genre you haven‚Äôt done that you would like to?

Thanks again!"
Stone Age,What are some of the challenges to working with a live eagle on set? Are those challenges any different from working with Brian Posehn?
Stone Age,What did it feel like to take down judomaster all by yourself?
Stone Age,Any hints on any other dceu upcoming projects you could be in üëÄ?
Stone Age,Is there any discussion on set about the similarities between Peacemaker and Ash vs The Evil Dead? The tone and feel of the two shows are really starting to blend and I love it!
Stone Age,"Hey Steve thanks for taking the time.  
What path brought you to acting and Suicide Squad? If there was something particular you'd recommend kids do to pursue an acting career, what worked for you?"
Stone Age,What is it like being a weekend dracula?
Stone Age,Who's your favourite comedy performer to share a screen with and why
Stone Age,Is Brian Posehn still listening to Two Princes by Spin Doctors on repeat?
Stone Age,Is it pronounced Ay-Ghee or Ay-G‚Ä¶ or Ah‚Ä¶?
Stone Age,What‚Äôs up dye beard
Stone Age,How do you plan to rub it in Peacemakers face that you took out Judomaster?
Scare Tactics,"only thing i can think of are the scare pranks i've seen on youtube, which there are a lot of, some from shows in other countries"
Scare Tactics,"I used to love this show.  It was so much fun, and it was cute because they would get mostly kids like teenagers to pull the pranks on, not adults... I'm guessing because adults would obviously figure out that the woman in the secret Satanic cult who's going into labor isn't going deliver a baby the size of a 5 year-old with horns and fangs who can walk upright and scream...... buuuut the teenage girl did!  And that was some fun television!"
Scare Tactics,I LOVED this show I wish it would return. 
Scare Tactics,Sounds like another lawsuit waiting to happen. They should bring back Shannon.
Scare Tactics,"Awesome, I always loved those. Don't even care how fake they are."
Scare Tactics,fake as shit 
Scare Tactics,"Definitely thought the title.meant one kid ""died"" during his watch and was taken back a bit"
Scare Tactics,"Best scares compilation part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wne3pAvyMRA

Best scares compilation part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9V8hoK_OSs

Lots more clips on the show's YouTube page: https://www.youtube.com/user/scaretacticschannel/videos"
Scare Tactics,Yup it's an ad
Scare Tactics,"I literally laughed out loud when the ""detective"" in the end walked around a popular Chinese mall (I have shopped there) like he is about to make a dangerous drug bust only to have the cosmetics guy ditch him. 

It was pure corporate-serving propaganda. It reminded me of ""Reefer Madness"" how cheesy fear mongering it was. There was exactly 1 lady who had a bad reaction and then the show bombarded you with a bunch of cops, detectives and scientist who work for the cosmetic companies with the ""pirates"" being some kind of bogeymen.  These companies sell their cosmetics with high markups internationally and while exploiting local labor for cheap in developing countries (giving them the tools to start a side hustle) and then expect it to not give rise to piracy."
Scare Tactics,[deleted]
Scare Tactics,Basically the premise of any how it's made or modern marvels episode
Scare Tactics,"Have you watched Rotten on Netflix?

I thought this was on off shoot like rotten, was a little like it but not enough depth like it.

Edit - also underworld Inc had a much better episode on counterfeits, which is really an issue for many brands but they didn‚Äôt talk in depth about it either."
Scare Tactics,What's going on with Netflix? There was an anime doc a while back that was a blatant add for their series.
Scare Tactics,"I just watched the make up one and I feel like it's very biased towards the rich and ultra elite. They make it seem as these counterfeiters are just bad guys and they are dangerous. So here is what we are doing to stop them.

Don't get me wrong, it's true that counterfeit items can be dangerous to the consumer, but the whole episode just had a very similar vibe to the war on drugs. Yea products are being produced illegally and it can be harmful, but what is the reason for it. What are some alternative ways of stopping this instead of old school police work? Even they say that the counterfeiters are improving and it's a race. A race that clearly the counterfeits are winning. Their suggestion to increase punishment sentences to scare off the crime is exactly war on drugs tone.

And now we have a bunch of people in jail. Why? Were they just bad people? Or were they just trying to feed their families? Did they just get out of jail and no other company would give them a chance? Did they just get into this country?

The whole episode was just trying to get us to feel sorry for police offices and corporate elites. Granted, it's not easy for the officers, but it's a very one sided war on drugs like episode."
Scare Tactics,It also feels like the entire series is very nationalistic.  Anything foreign is automatically dangerous.
Scare Tactics,"If You watched it and the other episodes....its supposed to centered around ""ads"" centering around scaring you.   
But they also do deeper dives into how and why those things happen. Why do females take the cheaper way to cover their faces in makeup.   


The Falling dressers and Makeup are basically centered around people and companies taking the cheapest route to make products and how they effect the people the buy it. Its not that simple to understand or follow. If you were thinking it was going to do anything other than that, you did that to yourself."
Scare Tactics,">It seemed like this was about scaring you on to how dangerous counterfeit cosmetics are and how much better genuine stuff is.

## 

The origins of the usage of different substances in beauty, skin, body, hair, and nails care products can be found in ancient times. To achieve better quality and enhance their effects, some additives such as preservatives, stabilizers, mineral pigments, dye, and shine were added to these products. **Some of these substances may also have allergic, irritating, and harmful effects on human health**. The aim of this study was the optimization of the potentiometric stripping analysis (PSA) for the purpose of determining the content of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, zinc), in some commercial cosmetic beauty products (lipsticks, lip glosses, eye shadows, and henna hair dye). **In addition, in order to monitor the potential adverse effects of henna dye on hair quality, as well as the total body burden of heavy metals (Pb, Cd), the paper analyzed hair samples before and after henna dye treatment**. Beauty products used for cosmetic purposes can have adverse effects to human health due to the fact that they contain lead, a highly toxic metal. The lead content in the tested samples varied depending on the additives used along with the method of production. The cosmetic products that were analyzed in this study contained a certain amount of zinc, which is an essential element, although its content above the prescribed limit may lead to side effects. Highly toxic metal, cadmium, was not detected in the tested samples. **The presence of these metals in cosmetic products certainly indicate that it is necessary to monitor and determinate the content of toxic heavy metals in these products, especially because they are in direct contact with skin or mucous membranes and are often used in daily life.**

the message here is

be aware of

legit vs counterfeit... or you're taking risks."
Scare Tactics,The thing I thought was fucking laughable were the middle aged and older straight men in law enforcement and customs tasked with correctly identifying authentic makeup...nevermind counterfeits. Because why hire anyone competent? And then casually dropping that there are too many shipping containers being imported to search them all. Like...wut.
Scare Tactics,I turned it off at that point lol
Scare Tactics,"to be a little fair on the whole ikea thing, their cabinet products really do suck."
Scare Tactics,No this is the first doco about this kind of genre that I have watched. I think it might have tarnished things for me
Scare Tactics,Yeah I'm a bit concerned about this kind of thing
Scare Tactics,"Yep, couldn't agree more. It seemed really off"
Scare Tactics,Depends on foreign from where. Having government agencies actually do their jobs and protect customers is a very first world thing.
Scare Tactics,"I feel the same way, they didn't even touch on makeup/dresser/etc. that are made in the US and happen to be dangerous"
Scare Tactics,Actually the ad for the TV series did that to me. As I pointed out in my post. You might have missed that while you were busy trying to think of something to put others down with.
Scare Tactics,">Why do females take the cheaper way to cover their faces in makeup.

Because a lot of women can't afford the ridiculous prices on brand name makeup?"
Scare Tactics,"> be aware of legit vs counterfeit... or you're taking risks

Lots of ""authentic"" brands have lead and mercury and harmful toxins.  Cosmetics is a nasty business, always has been.  Health is NOT their first priority"
Scare Tactics,"Ikea products are great, it's not their fault people are too stupid to anchor their furniture to the wall when they have toddlers."
Scare Tactics,[deleted]
Scare Tactics,"it really does illustrate the decline of consumers and the industry as a whole when ikea is considered ""great"". 

furniture used to be built well and last a lifetime. these days your choices are all about the current fad with no other thought given to the purchase."
Scare Tactics,"not gonna debate their motives or reasons. yes its a shit move on netflix part, but what i said, and say below, is still true."
Scare Tactics,downvote all you want but that fact remains that people like you have destroyed a domestic industry all in the name of cheap and disposable.
Scare Tactics,"If people could afford $4000 handmade wood cabinets they would buy them. Instead, you can spend a $100 on a cabinets that look nice, work with most other furniture, and is cheap enough to replace as you move/decide to upgrade.

Hating on IKEA is ridiculous. It‚Äôs affordable furniture in a modern style. There is a reason it‚Äôs popular and ubiquitous. We‚Äôre not destroying anything, we‚Äôre adapting to the times. No one owes you extra expense or effort just to prop up some old way of doing things we don‚Äôt need anymore."
Scare Tactics,"yup, adapting to times of disposable crap. adapting to marketing that switches the styles and fads around every year so the things you have are ""outdated"" and need replacing. just another form of planned obsolescence. are you going to buy a new refrigerator every year because it doesn't meet your aesthetic upturned nose anymore?  and btw good home furnishings can be found that are stylish and ""modern"". but you will pay for them knowing they will be a long lasting fixture of your household. you really think you will pass your ikea down in the family? nope. it'll fall apart after a few years more than likely. 

think your purchase through for more than a microsecond and think a little bit into the future beyond your immediate gratification. landfills are filling and forests are emptying because of people like you and their shortsightedness."
Scare Tactics,No one I know has furniture that last a lifetime. Lol my IKEA stuff has lasted just as long. No one wants the same nicked up old fashioned dresser in their house.
Scare Tactics,because you are buying crap. I still have an end table I made in 7th grade 30 years ago. My whole family has old and very usable furniture still. the house i bought 20 years ago came with furniture from the 50's and 60's that is still entireley good. a little modern touch of a finish and you're good. you're post is the perfect example of how the ikeas and walmarts of the world fuck you with a smile and you gladly and cluelessly take it all in. learn a little about what quality is before you jump to their defense so quickly.
Scare Tactics,[get well soon. ](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xAjFuA_2BS4/Vriz9eR-x4I/AAAAAAAADEM/krNrKyWz6yg/s1600/boomer-bubble-gum-mascot.jpg)
Scare Tactics,"I would say the reverse is true for me - if I don't know anyone in the cast (or don't like them), I'm a lot more likely to ""pass"".

But an actor being in a show with a premise that I don't like isn't going to get me to watch that show just because they're in it."
Scare Tactics,"I prefer not knowing any of the cast often. Mostly to have a blank slate on what the actors can represent or how they will act. 

Prefer, not strictly go for."
Scare Tactics,"I'll definitely check out a show because it has someone I like in it. Some actors, even if they aren't a star, are really good at picking projects.

That said, I tend to get a better hit rate by following producers and creators..

Often, these go hand in hand - producers find actors they like working with and cast them over and over"
Scare Tactics,"I will watch anything and everything with Alan Tudyk (Firefly, Tucker and Dale vs. evil, Dollhouse) in it."
Scare Tactics,I only watched The Good Place originally cause Kristin Bell is a delight
Scare Tactics,"Reality TV may be largely unscripted but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs real. Actors are just playing themselves, sometimes those versions of themselves are more real and sometimes they‚Äôre less real. But they‚Äôre still playing a character for the camera. Plenty of reality stars and TV hosts act very differently in front and behind the camera. So don‚Äôt take her friendly and happy performance as meaning that this is how she really feels and behaves all the time - it‚Äôs just that, a performance. I mean, it‚Äôs possible that she was happier doing reality than scripted TV - but this isn‚Äôt really valid evidence."
Scare Tactics,"Unscripted does not = real. Reality shows have producers behind the scene who's sole job it is to  manipulate and incite drama between ""contestants"". Imagine being on a show and having these guys whispering in your ear at all times in an attempt to stir the pot. That kind of fame definitely has its price."
Scare Tactics,"You've gotta translate well to tv and be memorable. Either by being yourself or playing up an attribute or back story to suite the narrative of the show, even reality tv."
Scare Tactics,"It's easier to be on ""reality TV"" if you consider consumer series and edutainment series as this.

Consumer shows vary in pay, but you're giving honest opinions on customer service and products - it's a more British than American style of show, outside of CNBC type networks."
Scare Tactics,"You know, you might just be maturing or you've just had your fill of that format. If you go back and watch some of the Scare Tactics you might find you don't enjoy those as much either.

Personally, I might like one or two of those episodes entertaining, but at some point, it ends up being the same thing over and over. And you start o see some of them might be faked reactions for the show all together."
Scare Tactics,"Scare Tactics had a better vibe and overall presentation. This show is just a repackaged Scare Tactics with all the same actors, but the host is completely unnecessary. Tracy Morgan was hilarious and the music was great."
Scare Tactics,Of all the things to watch on Netflix.
Scare Tactics,"I'm just glad it turned out to be a Scare Tactics clone, and not the 'we'll just fuck with unemployed people with no other hook' show they first announced."
Scare Tactics,The most genuine part of the show was in the first episode at the end where nobody knew who Gaven watshisname was lol. I would watch it again if every ending was like that. Sorry but your not quite Ashton kid.
Scare Tactics,"That‚Äôs too bad I really enjoyed it. Some of those scenarios were really fun. I never watched s are tactics though so it was fresh to me, also I didn‚Äôt find the kid annoying which helped"
Scare Tactics,"Eh, that could be part of it. Some of the reactions are entertaining, but for the wrong reasons, like when the ""victims"" don't even react to begin with. And it is a fairly limited format. One of the pranks I watched here was definitely in Scare Tactics, too, so it wasn't really a new thing. 

Just all very underwhelming, but perhaps you're right."
Scare Tactics,"To be fair I find their programming in general to be pretty underwhelming :|

lol @ downvoting, I guess there are a lot of Netflix shills here?"
Scare Tactics,"> not the 'we'll just fuck with unemployed people with no other hook' show they first announced.

Was that an original premise for Prank Encounters, or was that a different show they were developing? I'd be curious to read up on that (sounds screwed up though)."
Scare Tactics,"> also I didn‚Äôt find the kid annoying which helped

Yeah I mean he's not *that* bad, and I'm sure he's required to say ""My show on NETFLIX"" every time, but it's still kind of ... blech.

Definitely check out Scare Tactics if you liked this, the episodes are paced better in my opinion."
Scare Tactics,You keep putting these up and they genuinely make no sense at all. A lot of my education is in linguistics and none of this tracks or has any basis in fact. They're merely how writers write dialogue.

But I became very unsure about the pattern!)

***

I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a band focuses on.
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each band tells you something about some layer of the situation.
 
You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns in a single global ""spectrum"":

- *Scooter < I Like Trains < Assemblage 23 < Ashbury Heights < Elvis Presley* **(in the middle)** < *Coldplay and google-translated Kukryniksy & Kurt Vile < Electric Six*

- *< AWOLNATION and The Rolling Stones and Florence + The Machine and LMFAO < google-translated Mujuice and Aria and and google-translated Piknik and Queen and Hurts*

- *< John Lennon < P!nk and Phil Collins and Monoral and Eurythmics and Bondage Fairies and google-translated Nautilus Pompilius and Philip Kirkorov and Kate Bush < google-translated 7B < ""Weird Al"" Yankovic*

The farther you go, the more a band focuses on a single fact... or the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets.

That's just my intuition! (And I don't know how to order some and where to put some)

***

Another version of ""Post Scriptum"": (I apologize for bothering you)
 
All people for me are like heroes (or brilliant characters/ cool people!), no less. I know this is very improbable that I will be able to help anybody with this ""pattern language"", but there's a chance no matter how small and miniscule and absurd sounding **(and it's better than nothing, better than to do nothing at all)**
 
Maybe you can test this theory about speaking patterns with modern day technology such as [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)#Applications) or [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#GPT-3)"
Scare Tactics,"I believe you can apply those patterns to music bands, and the fun part is that you can apply the pattern to any piece of any song of the band (it's like a fractal: every piece looks alike)

Bonus with *inane* music band analogies ->

I will quote 

- *P!nk, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, John Lennon, LMFAO, Eurythmics, Ashbury Heights* **(6)**

(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...

(.) is a bunch of standalone facts/events that don't need any context to be understood, every bit of (.)-speech is a self-sustained point... you can split such speech into pieces without losing any context...

- *I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went* (-)(>) *So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)* (-)(>) *I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight*

on high level (situation): P!nk describes something that causes continous implications for example ""I'm gonna drink my money"" or ""I got a brand new attitude"" or ""I wanna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight"" or just a bunch of standalone facts

I mix it with [Stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry), i.e. I assume you can use Discourse analysis to define someone's style of speech"
Scare Tactics,"If its done in the right way and fits the story then im all for it! I hate when shows romanticize sucicide like 13 reasons why, sex scenes i think only work if it seems realistic and actually impacts the storyline, shows like how to get away with murder and power have sex scenes every 5 mins for the sake of it and theyre not even passionate/believable "
Scare Tactics,"I haven't watched the series, but it seems 13 Reasons Why has a high age restriction nearly everywhere. 

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837492/parentalguide?ref_=tt_ql_stry_5

So simply don't let children watch it, who might be influenced in a bad way by this series. It is not meant for them. The series is aimed at adults. And an adult who can't handle watching it and keep sane had problems before it already and I don't think the series will make it better or worse. "
Scare Tactics,Did you just submit this for a film kit class
Scare Tactics,"Nope. Click. It's impossible to unsee/unhear after it happens. Then it lives on in the brain. Human-on-human violence is almost porn, imho. Monsters from space? No problem. No such thing as suspending belief, though, when it comes to prurient violence. Just stop it. I quit TV, years ago."
Scare Tactics,don't take this the wrong way but if you quit TV years ago then why are you on a sub-reddit that is about TV shows?
Scare Tactics,"No problem. I still have hope, so I roam this sub. Loved Northern Exposure, Twin Peaks. 

I now stream, catch local news, on occasion, national news if broadcast without people making faces while news is reported. I'm also on Movies sub, a few others. 

But seriously, I just can't laugh off rape scenes, mainlining, abusing women. I can get whiffs of all that just going to the supermarket."
Scare Tactics,"I find it odd that you cannot contain explicit material but still watch national news where controversial or ""breaking news"" material happens constantly (then again, I do not know where you live)"
Scare Tactics,"That's apples/oranges. My brain can deal with horrific news reports on TV, just not with prurient, human-on-human violence. Its obscene, has no redeeming value, imho. That's all. "
Scare Tactics,"No, Captain Mainwaring is.

"
Scare Tactics,Yes ricks leadership and rebellion against negan has been portrayed horribly by the tv show. This entire seasons has been one huge let down. 
Scare Tactics,"The entire show seems to be written around the concept of the writers thinking up a cool cliffhanger endings then writing towards that goal no matter how out of place the character actions are or how stupid they act. Last season they either should have rammed through the first blockade or went home and sent someone on a motorcycle to get through the woods on a direct route to Hilltop, ignoring the roads to get the doctor and bring him back.

Speaking of, they are in the south. Tons of off-road vehicles all over that area. Why don't they have some so they can cut through the woods?"
Scare Tactics,"My last straw with his inability to manage his men was at the prison. Here you have a well fortified, fenced perimeter compound and you can't even succeed in that. What the hell Rick?"
Scare Tactics,"I agree, its one disapointment after another. Thank god the comics didn't lose It's way."
Scare Tactics,He also tries to reason with Jadis when the rest of his group is fighting back. His son takes out like 4 of them solo and Rick cant take one?
Scare Tactics,Rick Sanchez has proven to be one of the great strategic minds in television history.
Scare Tactics,"I honestly checked out when he said, ""We *are* the walking dead.""  

Okay Rick.  

EDIT: Sorry not sorry. It was corny AF. But I'm still watching. I'm just on Reddit the whole time cause the show sucks now."
Scare Tactics,How come Rick never tells them to take the assault rifles out of fully automatic mode?  Every bullet after the second one will go high and miss the zombie heads.
Scare Tactics,Don't forget about taking on the saviors in the first place before even attempting to do any recon and ascertain their numbers or capabilities.
Scare Tactics,"Heh, you had to go back 40 years to a sitcom to find worse, so I feel vindicated.  "
Scare Tactics,With great hesitation: can you give a couple of sentences as to how they handled it better?
Scare Tactics,"Rick feels responsible for the lives of *everyone* in his group, which freaks him right the fuck out. When he defeats Negan he settles into his role as leader better."
Scare Tactics,"Tbf, every other character is basically completely retarded compared to him"
Scare Tactics,He's the only Rick that matters.  Don't stand between him and his Szechuan sauce.

The majority of the comic once they get to Alexandria deals with fighting and protection"")"
Scare Tactics,"Yeah, I was referencing the TV show not the comics tho, and given that they had already turned on his people and his people we're in the middle of fighting the junkyard group he'd have been better off disarming Jadis than trying to reason with her."
Scare Tactics,"Got it thanks. I find my toleration for eye rolling bs is a lot higher in comics than in TV shows or movies, but still, good to know the comics handle it better."
Scare Tactics,Can't see it :(
Scare Tactics,Tl;dr: The comics are less oriented around the dragged out drama shit the show does. 
Scare Tactics,"And less oriented around shitty cliffhangers that have no payoff.  Basically, the show has become a cheesy drama while the comics have continued to tell an actual story that is heading somewhere."
Exhibit A,"> That said, I thought it would be a fun discussion to compare and contrast the two, seeing as there is significant overlap in subject matter and situations.

I'm going to be frank - there's nothing ""fun"" about it as these conversations quickly become cesspools of negativity about one show or the other. 

And I don't agree that the shows even make sense to compare. They're both fantasy genre but other than that, they couldn't be more different. There really isn't much similar in terms of the tone, plot, or characters between the shows."
Exhibit A,"I think the shows are way too different to be properly compared. We can compare general things like Visuals (RoP has better looks, but HotD has better character interaction with the sets), World Builing (HotD has the edge) and acting (...it's not even a match) , themes, ideas (or lack thereof) and the story they want to tell is completely different.

It's not a fair comparison."
Exhibit A,"after what they did to game of thrones, i just can't bring myself to watch house of the dragon. i have no interest in it, and doubt i ever will."
Exhibit A,">  Characters: at 8 episodes in for each at the time of writing this, both have had the same amount of screen time to establish their main cast, but I feel hotd has done a much better job of endearing me to their cast than rings.

I disagree. The Time jumps have hamstrung my investment in the characters in HOTD for me. All through this season, just as I was starting to get invested in the characters the show time jumped and replaced the actors. This past episode spent too much time on characters I had no investment in. 

Rings has done a better job of focusing on the characters in the way that the audience can invest in the characters successes and failures.

Over all I really don't care who gets the throne in HOTD. 

Then again I really don't care much about what happens to anyone in RoP and that is because of the next category,

>  Writing and dialog:

Both are a mess in this department, HOTD has done a better job of mapping out what the ""dramatic"" issue are, even thought I really don't care about it. It has really been unclear what RoP has been about for the bulk of it.

>  Battles and combat: this is a big peeve for me, and another reason I prefer hotd to rings. Compare Galadriels first fight against Prince Daemon battling the crab slayer. Galadriels combat was frilly and pretty, full of flips and unrealistic (and unnecessary) maneuvers. Where by contrast, Daemons charge, while highlighting his prowess as a warrior showed him as fallible, even almost dying after taking multiple arrows.

Dude, come on. Daemon's battle with the crab guy was absurd on every level.

One, who the hell was the crab guy?  

two, the whole single man against a flurry of arrows was just absurd.

Three, the whole suprise the dragon is here thing, was just eye-rolling stupid. The whole set up was that the only way the crab-guys army was lasting was the army didn't come out of the caves and this prevented the dragon from using its breath weapons on get them. But hey once they say the dragon rider guy is out on the battle field so clearly the dragons aren't going to attack, so they all come out of the caves. It made no sense.

That was just so bad.

**NOTE**

I list HOTD as the better show. Mostly because ROP is trying way to hard to make everything EPIC and it isn't pulling it off."
Exhibit A,">They're both fantasy genre

Their genres are really quite different. And that's what irks me about RoP being the result of the supposed Bezos quote-turned-meme ""Bring me the next Game of Thrones"".

House of the Dragon is a personal/political drama. Sure, there happens to be some fantasy elements in the background of the setting (dragons have shown up in a handful of scenes) but it's minor.

RoP is a fantasy adventure. Magical artifact mcguffins (the sword, the mithril, the dying tree). Fantasy races in just about every scene. Wizards waving their hands to make things glow."

 I have some friends that remind me of this couple. As annoying as Roseanne is, she's not unbearable like most TV wives. Dan's not portrayed as a moron.. The couple has an unmatched chemistry that isn't normally found on television.

The drama that the two went through felt real. As  loud and annoying as they were, they weren't constantly nagging at each other about petty shit. Neither came off as ungrateful for the other.

Dan doesn't treat Roseanne like she's a moron. Roseanne doesn't demand constant attention from him. Dan's not constantly scheming to pull one over on Roseanne. She's not trying to make him into the man she thinks he can be and lets him be the man that she is.

The only ""flaw"" in their characters is they're not attractive. They're middle aged fatties from the midwest.

The most enduring quality in this couple is the fact that the love the characters have for each other really comes through the TV screen. Unlike Ray and Debora, Penny and Leonard, Ross and Rachel, Doug and Kerri, or any other TV couple you're not left wondering WTF do they see in each other. They're a perfect match for each other."

Exhibit A,">For this next bit I'll probably kill my karma because I'll be talking about Game of Thrones. The show season 5 and onward has been on a slope of decline in quality. The lack of good dialogue. Too many jumps from place to place. Poorly choreographed action scenes. Lastly, a complete disregard to a consistent plot. You may disagree with these things I'm saying. Which is fine, the show is still widely entertaining and well loved, but you would at least expect SOME professional critics to take note of these things. But they don't.

That's just like, your opinion man. This whole thing kind of reads like *you* are the determiner of what is good and what is not and that if a critic disagrees with you, they are a bad critic. 

Critics don't **get it wrong** just because they have different opinions than you."
Exhibit A,"""...overtly political...""

I'm sorry but that's a load of shit. This was series I was interested in, and I read about 8-10 reviews on metacritic for this, and nearly all criticized it for its slow pace (not shocking considering the recent Netflix Marvel shows have stretched out barely a single issue comic story to a dozen hours of tv) and lack of originality. 

Do you really want critics to pander to your tastes rather than be honest about their view? There are specific sites that you can visit which will echo your views on a show for the fan clicks. "
Exhibit A,"People should stop thinking critics are everything and get mad when a show they like gets bad reviews. I love plenty of stuff that is considered crap by reviewers but I don't care. It's my free time I will watch whatever I want. 

Sometimes reviews are good to get an idea of a show but it doesn't mean you will love it or hate it because the reviewer does. "
Exhibit A,"The problem is that you don't seem to understand Rotten Tomatoes (I don't want this to sound insulting, it seems to be a fundamental problem with a lot of people who can't seem to figure it out, and RT doesn't seem to be in any hurry to correct anyone).

You mention that Punisher is at 61%. That doesn't mean it's 61% good, that they're rating it a 6.1/10, it means that 61% of critics liked it, and 39% didn't. So simply put, you fall into the 61% of people who liked it, of which some liked it a lot and some liked it just fine. TV is subjective so why is it unreasonable to imagine that 39% of people wouldn't?

You could point to the audience score of 94% and say why is it that so many people voted it so highly, well, I'll tell you that it's probably not a great sample size. It's 3300 people who were invested enough in the show to log into a site and rate it. It likely doesn't include a lot of people who disliked the show, or people who wouldn't even watch it in the first place. Whereas critics have to watch shows to review them whether they're predisposed to liking them or not.

And, to be fair to you, you do point out a couple of individual reviews, but it's fair for them to criticize shows for things that don't matter as much to you. Different people watch TV for different reasons. Like I enjoy watching The Big Bang Theory on occasion even though it's blasphemy to say something like, because sometimes I just want to sit there for 19 minutes and turn my brain off, man. And maybe I tune into marvel shows to see my favourite characters kick people in the face and watch things explode, and I'm not as interested in a 13 episode slow-burn character study about PTSD? Maybe I don't want weird takes about gun control for which I'm not sure which side of the aisle they fall on? 

Like, it's fair to disagree with a consensus, to have a take on a show that doesn't fall in the majority. Even with fucking Game of Thrones, [every season](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/game_of_thrones) has at least 1 dissenting review, you just happen to fall into that minority. I just hate this new trend of tossing aside the entirety of critical consensus just because you often don't find yourself in the majority."
Exhibit A,"Not increasingly, just as its always been...if they aren't getting better.  Today I saw ""Taboo"" on a worst of 2017 list which I thought was some fucking nonsense, but the same list had Mr. Robot and Handmaid's tale in the top ten, and the very fact that those three shows exist tells me TV is just continually getting better, which wouldn't happen if critics weren't guiding people toward ever-improving programming."
Exhibit A,"There are still great TV reviewers. Main example: Alan Sepinwall. I don't always agree with him (for example he didn't like Westworld though I enjoyed it a lot), but he always makes you understand WHY he didn't like something, and you may or may not agree but it's always a pretty good explanation.
Another example, he didn't like The Punisher, but his review was about what didn't work in the show as a TV show, not as a political conveyor of some message. He also was one of the harsher out there towards Game of Thrones Season 7 (and previous seasons too).

But you're right when you say that the overall quality of reviewers is probably dipping a bit, with Television increasingly getting bigger bigger (more shows, more outlets, more way to watch it) the number of people reviewing it has increased too and that leads to some dilution and overall quality going down. Alan is part of the ""old guard"" and is not the only one. Daniel Fienberg, James Poniewozik, Matt Zoller Seitz, Tim Goodman, Todd VanDerWeff, Maureen Ryan, these are guys (and gals) that off the top of my head are still putting out great content out there."
Exhibit A,"""Getting it wrong"" What, are critics supposed to be predicting what the general consensus thinks and just say that in their review? They're just giving their personal opinion, and I'm pretty sure that can't be wrong."
Exhibit A,">  As of writing, it currently sits as a 61% on Rotten Tomatoes. Which I guess is not 'rotten,' but speaking for myself I would never want to watch a show barely scraping by.


The Punisher did barely scrape by... 
"
Exhibit A,"Overall, I generally do not follow what reviewers have to say about a show or film.  Rather, I simply look at it and decide if the plot sounds interesting, and maybe watch a trailer or two if I am not sure.  Too many times I have not enjoyed something which the reviewers did, and vice-versa.
"
Exhibit A,I see plenty of critics basically shitting on GoT the past few seasons for similar things. Find better ones. IGN and such may still fawn over it but most good critics at least have reservations about it while acknowledging that it still covers a unique niche. 
Exhibit A,"Reviews are opinions, nothing more.  Why would you put any more stock in a Rotten Tomatoes review than you would from your Aunt Mabel?"
Exhibit A,No not really.
Exhibit A,"I think there is some shows where it might start out ""bad"" the first few episodes but gets better as it goes on when the writers/actors get a better feel for the characters in it.  They have an idea on what might work in it, and what won't work.  So critics might rate them poorly when they watch the first few episodes in it.

On the other side of it, very few shows tend to get better the longer it runs too.  Usually the quality starts to go down after a while, where maybe the writing starts to go down or maybe an actor/actress/writer leaves the show.  So maybe by the time they reach their 3rd or 4th season, it is no longer that great or the quality varies season to season. 

I think part of it is if a show (or movie) becomes popular or mainstream, people start to criticize it more since it is under a bigger microscope, where they think it is over rated.  I am sure there are some shows that are well like by majority of people, but disliked by a few people for whatever reason."
Exhibit A,"I think you took a wrong show to point out your issues , punisher deserves lot of criticism its getting, pacing being one of the main culprits. I am a Marvel fan but that show was way boring."
Exhibit A,"Could not agree more about GOT.  I love the show but this season it noticeably declined- especially the dialog and plot holes.  For instance, previous seasons took literally multiple seasons for characters to venture between parts of the realm, so how the fuck did Gendry get from far beyond the wall back to the wall, and have time to contact Denaris, and have time for Denaris to fly back to beyond the wall in time to rescue guys from an Island surrounded by the night king. Just looks really bad and poorly written.  Plus, the plot has become very predictable, with dialog that does not fit the quality of the previous seasons by any means, instead sounding like lingo from 2017.  Meh. "
Exhibit A,"Yea, I'm starting to not pay attention to Rotten Tomatoes.  No way Passengers deserves a 30%.  That movie belongs in the single digits."
Exhibit A,"Well you have reviews from people like Chris Stuckmann going toward the ""Critic's Score"", so the problem really isn't the critics, it's the people who treat critics like connoisseurs or experts or anything other than random people with opinions that make reviews"
Exhibit A,"I was with you until ""poorly choreographed action scenes"". I get and agree with some of the criticisms of this last season, but that sure as shit shouldn't be one of them because there were some absolutely amazingly choreographed battle scenes this past season. "
Exhibit A,reviewers are always bios so they can be wrong alot or right it determines who the person is and there values and believes on everything and how everything should work 
Exhibit A,"Reviewers have always sucked balls.  Take comedy for example, when has that every been well received?  I feel that entertainment critics are mostly jaded people who weren't good enough to actually crack it in their given industry and then just like to feel powerful. "
Exhibit A,"""Every critic is a failed artist."" - I Forget Who"
Exhibit A,[deleted]
Exhibit A,"TV critics have never been great but in the modern Internet era, they're simply terrible. Television has grown up and deserves better reviewers than ones interchangeable with video game bloggers. "

The Chosen One,"I was on a shoot about 6 weeks ago, and we were in rural Vermont. Nobody wore seatbelts in the pass van, then we went over a bump and everyone whacked their heads. Seatbelts were worn from that point on.

Still, due to the crazy hours and dark conditions, our sound guy got hit by one of the pass vans as it left location. Luckily nothing serious, but it was quite the wake up call.

We don‚Äôt know what caused this crash, but if it was the result of crew exhaustion, it was kind on inevitable that something like this would happen, given the intensity of film work. It needs to change."

Not a lot of details yet. Alarms have been raised about over-worked crew working long hours, and the dangers that poses. One wonders if this accident can be traced back to that, or if it's just a freak accident."
The Chosen One,"Accidents including loss of life happen on sets a lot more than people realize.

Family Business,I liked seeing Kurt calling Dexter out on his justification for killing people.
Family Business,The clown low-key looked like Phoenix‚Äôs Joker.
Family Business,"My guess is that it is going to end with Harrison having to kill Angela because the code that Dexter just put in him was, ""Don't get caught"". So Harrison kills Angela and now Dexter has to decide what to do with Harrison. Does he kill him like he killed his brother and end up forever alone, or does he say fuck it, let's go amurderin.


If they want to end the show, they kill Harrison."
Family Business,"I was split at first, but they've won me over now. I think they have things planned out, and all of the choices I was iffy on were 100% made for the right reasons. I just hope the good ratings don't make Showtime try to force more seasons than Clyde Phillips had planned for."
Family Business,"I will admit, I didn't see the twist with Molly coming. You'd think after being saved once, she'd be in the clear.

Also, while Harrison was definitely believing Dexter's justifications originally, likely more to make himself feel less like a monster, you could definitely see the wheels turning during the confrontation with Kurt on the table, and seeing Dexter savor the experience."
Family Business,"> episode title

Killing people, ~~hunting things~~ barely covering it up. The family business."
Family Business,"I am so sad that after the next week episode...we have no more dexter show to look forward to.

i hope they find away to keep the show going, we don't know what the ending is, but the actor can still deliver that original dexter show, and i loved the flash back episode explaining everything again.

&#x200B;

The ratings are amazing for this, and i think the last episode got a massive boost as well. 

As long as they dont pull a GOT final season ending..they have a real winner here and hopefully the network is willing to pick up for new seasons while the actor is also willing to keep going."
Family Business,"So does Dexter have a mutant healing factor or something? Dude flew through a car window, and got shot in the leg. Didn't see evidence of either in this episode."
Family Business,"This episode was good in showing Dexter, from Harrison's eyes, that Dexter is just a serial murderer. He sounded really delusional in this episode. 

Next episode, they're probably going to find Dexter's trophy of Matt. That's going to leave Angela with no doubt about who Dexter is and for Harrison, confirm that Dexter is no different.

Now that Dexter gave her that arrest book, I'm wondering if they're going to end it roughly the same way it started with Dexter being pulled over by Angela on the side of the road."
Family Business,"So good. 

Last episode got 8.2 million viewers, that‚Äôs massive

Big numbers yet I don‚Äôt see it talked about anywhere except here of course"
Family Business,"Dexter is going to be a valid target for Harrison, if he follows the code of Harry.  I feel that that is where the finale is heading."
Family Business,i‚Äôm still annoyed by angela ‚Äúfiguring everything out‚Äù by this huge ketamine plot hole üòí
Family Business,"Some are hypothesizing that Harrison will Dexter, but I find it more likely that Harrison will kill Angela (her being the only one who knows dexter is the BHB) and then boom Kurt Caldwell is still guilty & all that good stuff"
Family Business,The killings by Dexter this entire season were slow but it was worth seeing how crazy Kurt is. I wasn't expecting to see that he collected all of his victims and seeing the YouTube vlog girl in there was hella sad. I think father and son will run away to another rural city and this will be the ongoing theme for every season assuming there are future seasons.
Family Business,Waiting for dead deb to knock him out and take over
Family Business,"No, Harrison will not be killing Angela to keep her quiet. Angela doesn't fit the code nor will she ever. Angela is already on Team Vigilante with Dexter and Harrison, just, Dexter's audience doesn't realize this. How? Easy ... Angela has already proven to keep a huge secret, Jim's true identity which is of course, Dexter Morgan. Also, she will soon learn that Kurt did in fact kill her friend Iris ( she already suspects after Kurt's arrest but she will finally have confirmation ) as well as all those other women that Kurt killed and moth-balled. She might struggle with not following the law and enforcing it but she will give in to allowing Dexter to keep his secret and do his necessary work. I doubt they will ever be a couple again tho. How this happens exactly is unclear but I do not see her or Dexter doing this together in a new season. It just goes against who she is as a Police Officer. This was a very good episode. I pray to sweet Jesus that Dexter will return for a new season and reprising his role as Jim aka Dexter Morgan .. But ... BUT ... I don't see this happening, not is that small sleepy town. There isn't enough action to support Dexter's need to bring bad people to justice in that small town. So as it stands now, logic points to this being a one and done season. I really believe that Dexter dies at the end of this season. I hope I am proven wrong and that both Dexter and Harrison go off into the sunset only to set foot somewhere else. I really don't know. I do not like my logic and hope I am wrong but common sense is screaming at me. Also, there is no way Dexter's sister ( Jennifer Carpenter ) keeps coming back over and over again as the voice of reason for her Brother. That actress would never ever reprise a role like this season after season. In an interview, Michael C. Hall has said he hopes that this ""limited"" Dexter season answers a lot of questions that fans of the series have been looking for. I am not sure I would be a fan of a new Dexter series staring his Son Harrison but, I don't think that would happen. We can't stick Harrison into a new series as there is no history or depth to the character. What could happen is that Dexter and Harrison escape away and that the audience will be left guessing. I expect some twist of the knife so to speak at the end. I really do not think Dexter will be killed ( yes I am contradicting myself from my statement several lines up ) I saw this because there is no way in hell that the show would allow Harrison to lose both parents. So, maybe, Dexter is arrested. I dunno. My gut literally hurts that I have to wait another week. Dexter will always and forever be on my top 10 list of favorite things in life and trust me, that list is short and very special. This list has my very first love, how much I love Led Zeppelin, my favorite movie of all time, The Big Lebowski, etc so, it's a pretty special list. And I am proud that Dexter is on that list."
Family Business,I think Dexter's girlfriend finds out and is okay with it once she realizes how many people Kurt killed. They will end up together
Family Business,"I think ""New Blood"" as a title is about Harrison being the new Dexter. Showtimes seeing way too much money from this to let it go. 

Dexter gets caught and the set up is pretty good. Remember what doesn't burn? Well its in the ashes of his cabin and Angela is going to find it and realize the screws match between the one Kurt left for her and the one in the ashes of the cabin. Dexter will be arrested for sure. Shes going to try to make him take the blame for the killings in the area and also killing Molly. He could reveal Kurts trophy room, but that really doesn't explain away Matt. I don't think at that moment she will have enough to hold him though. Angela will hold most of what she suspects to herself and will make calls to Miami which either will take time to get return calls from OR someone from the old cast will make a special visit from Miami.

The heat will be on Dexter now even though he had to be released. The clocks ticking. I think its very possible Harrison kills Angela thinking hes doing the right thing in saving Dexter ( I mean he is a teenager after all) and I think Dexter will take the fall for it to save Harrison and everything will start to come apart. However I don't see Dexter as a person who will go to jail, I do see him as someone who will allow Harrison to escape while he leads the police on a crazy goose chase in which he is killed in gun fire. Dexter at the end will make the ultimate sacrifice for his son in which he shows Harrison exactly how much he loved him. 

The end. Harrison spinoff ""New Blood"" begins a 8 season run.

I think Dexter Morgan is going to be gone. Anyone not realizing how much Hall was ready to end Dexter for so many years is fooling themselves. Hall has always wanted to character to meet an ending that is final. I am not sure he really loves Dexter as a character. I think this was absolutely part of his agreement to come back. I would bet he was insitant that this was going to be the end of Dexter. He's made a lot of comments over the years and one of them was he was a little creeped out that fans would ask him to do things for photo ops he wasn't ok with. He also began to become bitter over his biggest role being Dexter from what I have gathered over the years.  So I think Halls agreement had to be on his terms to return and that term is that Dexter is dead when this is over.

Will he still work as Harrisons ""Deb""? Maybe he can probably get paid nice for an apparance a few times a year, and the show is set up for that to happen. But I do think Dexter will die."
Family Business,"Honestly I watched this episode with major anxiety, the thought of dexter getting caught or killed would really ruin this for me üò¢ watching Dexter be so frantic and not being able to sense Angela‚Äôs distant behaviour has me stressed hahahaha, they‚Äôve done so well with this series I hope dexters still around for a season 2
Edit: spelling"
Family Business,"So molly who literally studies serial killers for a living, had a creepy encounter with kurt, has to get saved by dexter, still somehow ends up dead? Like what? If i was her i would have reported the incident and then left town"
Family Business,"So in this episode Dexter tells Harrison he killed trinity for what he did to Rita, but he had already killed Trinity before he found out Rita was dead. So is Dexter deliberately lying to Harrison to save face about what led to his moms death? Or is this another plot slip up?"
Family Business,Could it be that the big surprise in the finale is that Harrison is not Harrison?
Family Business,So it seems like Harrison is on board with dexter style justice but he might have to find his own way of doing it and his own kill room. Dexter saw his mom dismembered with a chainsaw so that‚Äôs how he chops up bodies. Seemed like that was a bit much for Harrison. But I think the show will probably end with Dexter dying or getting caught and Harrison continuing on the tradition
Family Business,Dexter as the dark passenger voice is such a neat idea I can't see anything other than it happening.
Family Business,Mery fucking kill how did that happen. She didn't even fit the bill. Also the first time he was desperate and idk why she would follow him into an unknown cabin and go in the basement when she should know she's a serial killer podcaster who thought she would be smarter. Wonder how he got her this time prob kidnapped her. She still didn't fit his code though. Also why target such high profile victims she has an army of detectives remember she said this to Angele and was able to find out about some of the missing girls. Her fans would find her this wouldn't go quietly.
Family Business,"It‚Äôs been a while since I saw the original run, but did we ever see Dexter chop up the bodies so ‚Ä¶ vividly like we did in this episode? That was an excellent was of having the audience see Harrison‚Äôs view of things."
Family Business,"Still a few loose end plot holes that if aren‚Äôt resolved completely undermine the credibility of this series as a whole and ruins it really. 

The whole ketamine/m99 and syringe thing first of all. Now it‚Äôs likely that only Dexter knew about M99 bring his drug of choice since when Masuka saw the syringe and had that dead lady tested in season 1 and found M99, that victim was never attributed to the Bay Harbor butcher (and Dexter subsequently eliminated any trace of how he obtained the M99). In season 2 when the victims of BHB were found, Dexter messed up the refrigerator so they couldn‚Äôt do any toxicology reports I believe, but how did they did they not notice any of the syringe marks?? In the photos of the bodies in this New Blood episode, the syringe marks are clearly focused on but I don‚Äôt remember this ever being focus of Miami Metro and the FBI in original shows investigation‚Ä¶ and now thinking about it, it seems incredulous no one would have noticed those marks lol‚Ä¶.So how did the syringe and ketamine get attributed to Doakes? To my knowledge, this was never established in the original series, so I surely hope they explain this. Otherwise it‚Äôs just terrible on the writers part. And then how did Dexter end up coincidentally using the same drug that has somehow now mysteriously been attributed to Doakes as the BHB?

Lastly, Dexter tells Harrison he killed trinity for what he did to Rita, but he had already killed Trinity before he found out Rita was dead. So is Dexter deliberately lying to Harrison to save face about what led to his moms death? Or is this another slip up?"
Family Business,I think watching Dex try to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô and celebrate Christmas was the scariest we‚Äôve ever seen him. His overt blending in was straight up anxiety inducing. Bonus points for gifting Harrison with the signature long sleeve ‚Äòkill‚Äô tee.
Family Business,Unpopular opinion probably but I thought Deb showing up every episode was just too much. It was satisfying this episode to see her warn Dexter against talking to Harrison and him just ignoring her completely. I know she's a figment of his psyche and all but... she was getting annoying to me.
Family Business,I‚Äôm probably going to get downvoted here.. but.. the clown was so cringe. They couldn‚Äôt have created any other scenario to describe his ‚ÄúDark Passenger‚Äù. I was rolling my eyes until they were breaking the fourth wall.
Family Business,"My biggest issue with this season is They‚Äôve been rushing this season along just because they know they‚Äôve got a limited run but I wish they would just take their time with it! This convenient writing is really just lazy which is a shame because they‚Äôre actually otherwise doing a relatively good job at redeeming their last crappy ending. But Angela‚Äôs first google search with ketamine and Miami metro should not be BHB, especially since he used M99. This was the most obvious one but she‚Äôs been too conveniently finding breadcrumbs all season. But they could still go any way with the ending. Maybe they‚Äôll leave it open for a revival"
Family Business,"The one long-shot theory that I had was killed off in this episode.  I thought it was possible that Harrison was working with the Murder podcast girl, and that he tracked her down due to Trinity, then got pulled into the BHB case, thinking it could be his dad because of the letter.

I was picturing a finale where Harrison turned out to be a good guy, and brought Dexter down, after Dexter revealed the Code.  

Now, I'm not sure what they're going to do.  With the M99/Ketamine plot hole, they butchered part of Dexter's original story arc.  The way Angela has coincidentally stumbled into everything from meeting Batista at the conference, to uncovering the real identity of Dexter Morgan, has been one giant leap in ""suspend your disbelief"" storytelling.

They could have done more with the podcast girl.  Angela's white whale could have led to the podcast girl revealing her own white whale, The Bay Harbor Butcher.  She could have been the one that talked about the needle marks from Miami, and even said she used to have a suspect...Dexter Morgan...but he's dead now, which would have opened up the whole Angela storyline a lot easier.  Angela sees the picture of Dexter, freaks, and goes to Jim, who tell her everything.  She's suspicious, but she buys it, until she comes across a complaint from the guy they recently arrested, saying that he got stabbed in the neck by something.

That ties Dexter/Jim to the BHB, and Angela is exactly where she is leading into the final episode with a more coherent storyline."
Family Business,"Everything changed when Kurt told Harrison about Dexter killing his son. Remember that scene in the school where Harrison sees all of Matt's trophies and Kurt's pride? That scene was included for a reason. It humanized Matt as a worthy person and loved

Harrison's whole demeanor suddenly changed and he was repulsed by Kurt's death 

My prediction: Harrison kills Dexter with his new rifle (Chekov's gun)

Last way I want this series to end but seems to be shaping up"
Family Business,"I disagree with most comments. I'm not sure how the series will end, honestly we should have gotten 3 more seasons just to wrap up the story.


At the end of the day. Dexter will not get a happy ever after ending. Dexter will die and Harrison will break the pattern.

How, i have no idea. It feels a bit like the GOT ending, way to short and forced to wrap up the ending quickly. Unfortunately i think the ending will be rushed and forced"
Family Business,"Who left the note? Had to be the city forensics person, right?
... No, because there was no postage so it had to be a townie meaning it was definitely old guy. Oh, I suppose he was going to confess to the arson and use his son as an excuse."
Family Business,"Is dexter's kid a fucking idiot? His dad tells him all that shit he does and Harrison is just like ""oh yeah, totally dad, I totally believe you have an urge to kill people and then go through all this trouble to kidnap and restrain them and then you totally just let them go omg! You're like batman!"" 

Fucking seriously? This whole season has had such incredibly shitty writing. It feels crazy seeing such great reviews for what is such objectively bad writing. It's every bit as bad as the last season was."
Family Business,"are we even sure Harrison is actually his son? He could also be  another Dexter victims son looking for revenge or if indeed he is Dexter""s son, coul dhe actually be wanting revenge on his father for indirectly causing the death of his mother?"
Family Business,"So as I‚Äôm rewatching the episode there‚Äôs a moment where Angela is in the hotel room Molly
checked out of and asking why the safe is locked. When the guy who is letting her into the hotel room responds, he clears his throat in a suspicious way as if something already strange may have happened that he isn‚Äôt reporting. Could this be he knows that Kurt had something to do with her disappearing? It‚Äôs just an odd moment for me. I think Kurt had many minions."
Family Business,"Small point, but if Dexter had only initially planned to give Harrison part of the story, telling him the correct performing name of the clown he killed was incredibly sloppy."
Family Business,I‚Äôm just glad I no longer feel the anxiousness when Dexter and Harrison are doing the business. My mind is constantly thinking ‚Äúwhat if they get caught?‚Äù even though they were at a remote location.
Family Business,"Maybe already posted and just haven't seen yet, but did anyone see a familiar face in Kurt's boxes?  One we had not heard was missing."
Family Business,"Harrison is not Dexter. He's clearly afraid of blood and he just realised he's not a killer while watching his father's ritual. 
The only thing left for him to do is to bury his daddy by telling the truth about him. It's the only way he'll be able to move forward."
Family Business,"Terrible ending guys just terrible I guess micheal hall was sick of the show, but that was the dumbest ending wow!  U ruined a good show sucks"
Family Business,Why? Its perfectly fine justification. Kurts justification was the joke.
Family Business,Leave Batman alone!!!!
Family Business,The way the makeup was done
Family Business,"They have been throwing the term ""Batman"" around a lot."
Family Business,"Yep, I thought this as soon as I saw him"
Family Business,"I thought its an reference or  an easter egg, even the guy kinda looked like Phoenix."
Family Business,I want to see a fan edit mashup of this now.
Family Business,"I  think Dexter and Harrison will ride off into the sunset together, Father and Son and are never seen again. Dexter won't / can't die. Why? There is no way they kill both of Harrison's parents. That would be too cruel. But this is mostly likely and one and done season. It's the closure that all of the fan's of Dexter have been asking for for years and that Michael C. Hall have been wanting to do. There is also the possibility that Harrison dies just as Deb has always feared. This would be the most shocking outcome and dare I say, fitting ending to the series. I wonder if the rifle Harrison got for Christmas was a nod to this fact. It's gonna be a long long week folks. I'm so scared to watch episode 10."
Family Business,[removed]
Family Business,"That's interesting, kind of an unintended consequences of the lesson.  If rule 1 is don't get caught then that would trump all other rules right?  Or at least someone learning from scratch could see it that way easily.  Otherwise rule 1 should be only kill bad people or something lol."
Family Business,"I hated the first episode of this season, stopped watching, and binged the rest of the season, today. There are lots of plot holes, but it definitely got a campy fun quality that original series had. Whatever this season's ending is, it must be better than the eighth season's ending."
Family Business,"Harrison reaffirmed multiple times the number of lives that were saved by Dexter eliminating killers. It could go either way: Harrison embraces the comic book vigilante code like most Zoomers likely would, he sees the ‚Äúend result‚Äù of what that life brings and goes in a new direction (therapy, institutionalization, etc), or he becomes an unrestrained serial killer.

Either way, he suffers from the identical trauma his father suffered. No one has given him a practical outlet for that trauma until now. It also happens to be his real father. The anger and abandonment issues he felt are satisfactorily nullified. If anything, I see him going all-in Team Dexter. Even if Dexter gets caught, Harrison is being set up to continue the legacy."
Family Business,I disagree I like the show and all but how can you say that when the chief of police all of a sudden becomes Sherlock Holmes. She couldn't get krut who has been doing it for years. Stopped pursuing him after he got away with that story just beloved it lmfao like come on. Dexter didn't use ketamine in Miami so her googling that and it coming up as bay harbor butcher first result really. Worst writing in history of tv better way they could have done it. It's a good show but can never be great. But still a pretty darn good entertaining show.
Family Business,"I'm sad as well. The show is getting rave reviews and is extremely popular. Money is the king of all. I am sure that after Dexter New Blood ends and the numbers are in, Michael C. Hall goes and sits down with Showtime and Showtime says ... we want to order another two seasons and they throw a lot of money and I do mean, a lot of money at him. I bet we get Dexter New Blood Season 2. Let's hope and pray to god this happens. There are not a lot of successes going on right now in Hollywood with Covid-19 and the delays and missed ticket sales, new shows being ordered and or in production .. from what I was reading, Dexter is perhaps within the top 10 most profitable and successful shows in the United States market for 2021. That's a huge huge accomplishment."
Family Business,"I think its a bit premature to think that Dexter ends next week. I think we're gonna get kind of an ambigious ending that could be taken as a true ""ending"" but its gonna be open enough that if reviews and fan interest is high enough (which it probably is) they can smoothly transition into season 2."
Family Business,Lmfao I forgot about that üòÇ
Family Business,"It's  a medical condition called ""Hollywood"""
Family Business,"Lmao I completely forgot about that. Now that I think about it, Dexter has always had mutant healing"
Family Business,Haha. Oh yeah. I completely forgot that happened. Haha
Family Business,"He doesn‚Äôt have a trophy of Matt, he said he can‚Äôt do that anymore because it‚Äôs a risk."
Family Business,"""Can I help you officer"" - he said flirty

""Dexter Morgan.............you're under arrest"""
Family Business,"Especially everything he said to Kurt was true of himself - He does what he does because he likes the control - He attested as much to a number of his kills and Deb. The fact the world is a better place because of it is completely ancillary though it does pose an interesting philosophical question, albeit one that's been diluted over the show as Dexter became more human. I always thought the show was more challenging when he was an emotionless homicidal sociopath that as a byproduct made the world better and you felt uneasy rooting for him - it was an interesting dilemma.

That synopsis is kinda lol though, Kurt is probably the most humane and tender serial killer antagonist we've had, an instant shot through the heart so they don't suffer after holing them up in a 5 star hotel room :p Compared to Miguel, the skinner, Ice truck killer, Trinity, the doomsday guy, the rape gang, a Ukranian hitman, the brain surgeon and even Dexter himself it's really tame and non-violent."
Family Business,"You think that will be the ""break the internet"" finale - Angela arresting him and then what?"
Family Business,"I called it from the start that the series would end with Harrison killing Dexter, I think it would be fitting."
Family Business,If angel doesn‚Äôt come back in and be like ‚Äúoh shit it‚Äôs Dexter‚Äù I‚Äôm gonna be thoroughly disappointed
Family Business,"Source for that? I don't see numbers like that anywhere?

Edit: found it. That article is referring to total viewship thus far for the very first episode with the 8 million number. The episode had 2.34 million viewers."
Family Business,"I mean...if Harrison kills Dexter because he fits Harry's code, then Harrison also fits Harry's code."
Family Business,"You're a fool if you think they are killing dexter off. They didnt do it a decade ago, they wont do it next week."
Family Business,">  by this huge ketamine plot hole üòí

just because he used m99 doesn't mean a search engine wouldn't find exactly what you wanted by searching ketamine. All it takes is people in miami trying to remember the killer they heard about and thinking ketamine and searching for it"
Family Business,"I mean, is it really a plot hole? The season opens with Dexter saying he hasn't done this sort of thing in years - it's completely fitting that he's gotten relatively sloppy with it."
Family Business,">No, Harrison will not be killing Angela to keep her quiet. Angela doesn't fit the code nor will she ever.

Anyone fits the code due to rule #1. eg: killing laguerta, or about to anyway"
Family Business,"Agree with everything. This is exactly what I'm thinking, and also what I'm hoping for. I'd love to check back in after the last episode to see if we were right, and to discuss what happened if we're not."
Family Business,Like a dentist missing a cavity
Family Business,"It's a stretch to say she studies them for a living. Most true crime podcasts are just made by people really interested in the topic. She was so obsessed with getting the story, it got her killed."
Family Business,"I know it's a year later but replying anyway because this stood out to me, too. I don't know if he had enough reason at this point in his confession to lie about the order of those events, unless he plans on spinning the entire Trinity story to omit his involvement with Arthur which in my opinion ultimately led to Rita being a chosen victim.

But at the same time it's hard to imagine the writers would forget about something as epic as Arthur's ""it's already over"" line on the table and the revelation at the end of season 4 when Dexter gets home. I mean that whole twist was a huge deal."
Family Business,"I haven't considered this at all and it feels kind of unlikely, but damn that would be fucked up."
Family Business,"Ok first things first:

No, she didn't fit the bill. But his last kill was a fail and so he needed another kill to make his urge stop. So he picked one, where he knew, he could do it to her, aka Mery fucking kill.

She lives for her stories and probably didn't think of him as too much threat, even though she was wary of a risk in the air. 

He probably kidnapped her as u said from the hotel room, cause he couldn't let it go."
Family Business,"We've seen it a couple times in bits but never with such emphasis on the gruesome and insane nature of what he does, and having someone other than Dexter in the room watching him at that moment also emphasizes just how fucked up all of this is. I think they wanted to emphasize the terrifying gravity of what Harrison is witnessing"
Family Business,"Probably saving his face on the last part. Lest we forget, Dexter is very good at lying and also rationalizing lying. He also conveniently forgot to mention that Trinity only went after Rita because Dexter went after him. If he had said that, Harrison would maybe now have a less romanticized view of Dexter's line of work and the kind of danger it puts those close to you in."
Family Business,I just can't believe Dexter would not make a cut where the syringe marks in the first place destroying any evidence of how the bhb operated because of rule 1
Family Business,"And his ugly Xmas sweater fetish!!!  Him thinking giving Angela a book about her job was a good gift (*though thoughtful, not the best gift idea, lol, I hate the cliche gifts of candles, but I'd take a Yankee candle over that book specifically if I was a cop) I lol so hard at Harrison's gifts (warm socks, this ain't Miami, black long John's, gun)  ...  it's like he's doing his best to fit in, help and support others, but is fucking oblivious that what he thinks is normal or good natured is actually kinda fucking weird"
Family Business,"You're right in that we've never seen such a cheesy kill before on the show. The way I see it, though,  it was Dexter telling Harrison a story of one his kills from his own point of view. He's never told such details of what he does to someone before, and he's embellishing hard just how cartoony crazy the clown was because he wants Harrison to take his side. He wants Harrison's approval and to say that the clown deserved it. When Harrison calls Dexter ""Batman"", you can see the satisfaction that goes across Dexter's face. 

If you remember season 1 of the original show, Dexter used to fantasize about people holding up signs commending and showing support for him. Dexter, in turn, becoming famous among the public for all the good he's done for the world by eliminating the ""real"" monsters of the world. This is what he's always wanted. Then add in that Harrison has some of the same urges as him, Dexter has someone to share his kill ritual with now - something else he's also always wanted. He doesn't feel so alone anymore. It wasn't the first time Dexter has tried to connect with someone having previously tried sharing his ways with his brother in season 1, Miguel in season 3, and seeking out the Trinity Killer season 4. Now he thinks he has Harrison, but by the boy's reaction to the blood during the dismembering of Kurt's body, it doesn't look good...I agree with others here that I don't think it's going to end well for the father and son."
Family Business,Why don‚Äôt u go write some fan fiction then
Family Business,I agree they could have done much better with the storyline.S I was thinking one if the episodes they mentioned I think a commentated saying with dials when they ran special ops and he couldn't have done one of the murders. I was thinking as part of doing the BB story she interviews people including this guy and a couple other special ops guys he knew. And she with their help starts putting it together that it might be Dexter or something like that.
Family Business,Hold up a sec. When/where the Mary said her suspect was Dexter for BHB?
Family Business,"This is my theory as well! I think Harrison is going to kill Dexter. To me, it seems like Harrison has been taking mental ""notes"" per se, and asking a lot of questions. I think it is the answer to these questions that will provide meeting code to kill."
Family Business,I think it was Kurt who left it.
Family Business,Probably Doakes.
Family Business,"Kurt, when he stopped by Angela's house earlier in the episode."
Family Business,"I think Kurt was planning to use the same strategy Dexter used on him after Kurt ransacked his place to pack.  He reveals Jim killed Matt, but the cabin has burnt down, and Dexter/Harrison are nowhere to be found.  Angela assumes they left town and torched the cabin to destroy the evidence.  He just didn't know that Angela already suspects Dexter/Jim of something much worse than killing Matt."
Family Business,"No, Angela gave that thing to a person she knew to find out who's finger print are on that thing and that was Jim Lindsay's"
Family Business,"I think he was just playing along until he could have time to unwrap that psychological Christmas present. Later in the episode, he directly inquired the truth of it. The first episode was shitty writing, in my opinion, but it became classic Dexter afterwards, with a twist.

You are definitely analyzing a character through the fourth wall."
Family Business,Harrison would need to be the greatest actor in the world. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
Family Business,The character has flashbacks of the trinity murder scene. That would be too far fetched
Family Business,"Kurt's line of ""protecting"" and ""saving"" them was a crock of shit. I wish there was a more complex reason for Kurt's murders. I mean, whatever, the dad stuff at least made it somewhat plausible but completely backwards. After seeing what his dad did to them, he should've really wanted to see them through that they are safe; not just kill them. 

On a different note, I have to admit that it's weird to see Dexter so proud of what he's done. I mean, they obviously write him to be the anti-hero but it's just nice seeing him so happy, albeit in a sickly weird way but hey! That's what makes this show so great.

To this point, the season has had me enthralled. I can't wait for next Saturday night/Sunday to see if they can really write this season off and do it the justice it deserves. I hope this isn't the end of Dexter and Harrison's journeys together but it sure seems fitting to do something dramatic from a storytelling standpoint. 

Plus, I don't know how they can continue it without avoiding the current setup getting stale. I'm hoping the show-runners have a few surprises up their sleeve yet. Fingers crossed."
Family Business,"Still, for a serial killer to be called out on his justification, it‚Äôs borderline insulting for Dexter because he knows nobody but him and possibly Harrison will understand"
Family Business,"Definetely, especially when you catch him looking at himself in the mirror. Neat little flashback scene all round."
Paranoia Agent,Incredible show. It has more ups than downs imo. Some arcs like the Pegasus one in season 2 are simply incredible.
Paranoia Agent,"Back in the day, we called those one-off episodes '""Helo Suit"" shows, because they usually featured Tamoh Penikott playing a character that looked like Helo, but behaved in ways completely different from everything that had been established for him in the show's arc. I think a lot of them came out of SyFy's desire to stretch out the season."
Paranoia Agent,"It's not perfect, but it's my favorite TV show of all time.

The characters are multidimensional, the plot naturally explores philosophical quandaries, and actions (usually) have consequences. The premise also allows for the escalation of drama to evolve naturally, and in some ways the society in the show gives a snapshot of an idealized version of our own, a vision of what we could be, without feeling forced."
Paranoia Agent,I rewatch the miniseries at least once a year. To me the two part miniseries is probably the best pilot episode of all time.
Paranoia Agent,"You did watch it as it aired but I strongly urge you to look at the headlines around the time the show aired. They wrote a lot of critique of foreign policy stuff into the script and it worked beautifully


This was the dubya cowboy dictator  years"
Paranoia Agent,I adore the relationship of Laura and Adama. I think it's one of the best relationships ever to grace the screen. It wasn't filled with pointless drama or love triangles... Just two people who are forced to work together and slowly fall in love over the years. It's beautiful.
Paranoia Agent,"It was a great show, and I found the ending emotionally very satisfying, yet sad. It wasn't perfect, but it did things I hadn't seen done in Sci-Fi shows before. 

And it had Bear McCreary's fantastic soundtrack. This guy is a genius."
Paranoia Agent,"Watching this as it aired was a wild ride. The Season 3 finale in particular blew all the fans‚Äô minds, and the Season 4 premiere was anticipated so highly due to the cliffhanger and longer than usual wait for it to come back (a year and a half IIRC, which was VERY unusual at the time)."
Paranoia Agent,"Oh, you're talking about the 2nd one....."
Paranoia Agent,this is one of the best shows i have ever watched in my life
Paranoia Agent,[deleted]
Paranoia Agent,Good post man. Going to rewatch it all again off of the back of your critique. Cheers!
Paranoia Agent,What‚Äôs your opinion on beets and bears?
Paranoia Agent,"i watched half the series

it bogs down around the time Balthazar become president of the human colony which is held prisoner by the cylons on that new world

i just lost interest and stopped watching. 

the show needed tighter stories/better pacing."
Paranoia Agent,"I liked 12 monkeys the movie, how would you rate the show? I really liked BSG and firefly"
Paranoia Agent,Was it just as fun watching knowing who all the robots humans were?
Paranoia Agent,"Just bought the ultimate dvd collection, and blueray collection of all the movies too.. :) I am loving it all over again, and am suprised over the things I've forgotten!"
Paranoia Agent,"For me, The Expanse series as a television show is almost incomparable to the exceptional epic-ness that is Battlestar Galactica.   For one, the casting on Expanse is hit or miss...  (Although the Expanse paperbacks are super different and sooooo much better.)

You're right that the BSG action scenes are incredible.  I freelance as a film producer, but after watching a BSG battle scene, I always think ""Frak me - I should have gone into props and choreography.""  Still, I'm conflicted about how compulsively war-oriented the characters are.  On one hand, their inner fight and relentless drive are mind-blowing and total #personalgoals.  On the other hand, some of the characters become annoying as civvies / when not fighting.  Like Starbuck (of course), Gaeta (not really interested in your tattoo, my friend...) and Saul (valiantly fighting for Bill, or off-duty assaulting lower-rank officers).

Oh boy, don't get me started on Starbuck.  Regardless of which iteration of the show, whether a man or woman, how the heck did this character have so many people kissing their sadistic ass?!  There was the episode when she returns from death/Earth, and Starbuck is losing it - screaming, kicking, pointing guns at people, telling her husband she'd kill him - essentially all her dudes respond with ""Shucks well alright, because you're Starbuck.""  She seemed like some wet dream from the writer guys.  Thanks God(s) when Starbuck disappeared for good. Now maybe Lee has the chance to have a healthy not-doomed romance.

And as you can tell from my username, I adore Chief.  I was frequently yelling at my television,  ""Galen - I'm free next weekend.  You and me, let's go on a date.  I heart ya G."" Obviously that character's ultimate / best relationship was with me (not really, I wish haha), but seriously gosh he only got better and better.  I felt like there was such consistency with this character, and I am obviously crushing, but I also felt like some of the character's reliability (regardless of murdering Tory and Cyclon heritage) was imbued from the amazing Aaron Douglas.  I think every actor/character had a questionable and eye-rolling moment, like when Bill would lose objectivity as the worst possible moment to lose objectivity or when Lee would momentarily break a jock/frat boy dance move.  Chief's way of accepting his Cyclon nature was proactive and brave and endearing - like that moment in S4 when he even laughed about it.  And he advocated for Cylon workers to be integrated w/ Galactica crew.  I'll stop here.  Except to say during in the last episode during Chief's final minute on screen, with Saul and Ellen, I was like ""noooooooo don't leave yet!""  Haha.

I guess I was searching for peace within a show about fighting, and even though the battle scenes were phenomenal, I constantly took refuge in Chief Tyrol - even during the Chief's shaved-head rough patch.

And yes, it did feel like reading a great novel.  My neighbors could definitely hear me cat-calling at Chief Tyrol or bemoaing ""gawd she is so awful"" during Starbuck scenes, but I don't give one rip.  It was a really special television experience.  In fact, just tonight after I finished watching the series on Amazon Prime, I decided to create my first reddit account so that I could rant and rave with fellow fans - voil√† et salut!

What else ... random last thoughts:  \[1\] I suspected Lee was meant to be irritating, right?  To show/highlight how much he steps up and (professionally) matures??  \[2\]  I could write a whole 'nother rant about Gaius in the last episode.  When he admitted "" I might be mad, BUT...""  That ""BUT...""  That line was riveting.  When the writers finally - after four seasons - stripped this character of his arrogance, it was moving.  \[3\]  Laura and Bill might always be my most favorite television couple, and in general I liked the show's perspective on marriage / long-term commitment (yes you have your partner, but you also have the space to develop your individual destiny.)"
Paranoia Agent,NBC is going to do a reboot/continuation of BSG on their Peacock streaming service next year.
Paranoia Agent,"[spoiler](#s ""top 3 IMO are Pegasus, New Caprica and the mutiny in the last season."")

So intense the first time I watched it, and I still get goosebumps everytime I hear Roslins ""I am coming for all of you"" speech"
Paranoia Agent,"See for me, it never surpassed the New Caprica/Pegasus arc, and slowly sunk in to ""why am I even watching this""."
Paranoia Agent,"You can definitely feel that in some of those mid season episodes, where everyone acts completely differently for the purposes of some one off storyline. ‚ÄúHelo Suit‚Äù is a great name for it"
Paranoia Agent,"No, 33 is the best pilot episode of all time. ;)"
Paranoia Agent,"I forgot to mention the music in my post, it was so amazing that it kept me invested even when the story didn‚Äôt. Those opening after credit scenes where it shows tidbits of the episode to come (that shit would never fly now with today‚Äôs spoiler-phobic audiences) always pumped me up, like a call to war."
Paranoia Agent,"I think because of certain slumps in the narrative, it was annoying to watch when it first came out and we were watching week to week. But binging it this time I‚Äôve found the story to feel a lot tighter (except for some filler episodes) and the story does seem to all add up. I still have a few eps to go before the conclusion, though. Great journey, though, regardless."
Paranoia Agent,The Cylons *definitely* didn't have a plan.
Paranoia Agent,"The story wraps up real nice, Kara not withstanding, one of the best endings out there. I have said many times the the Expanse is the best sci-fi since Battlestar."
Paranoia Agent,"I don't think that's fair. Some people didn't like the ending, but it tied up everything very neatly.

To say that it doesn't pay off is very unfair."
Paranoia Agent,"I implore you to finish it. There are SO MANY great things about the show and honestly, you can pretty much go 50/50 on how you‚Äôll feel about the finale. I understand that I‚Äôm in the VAST minority who actually loves how the show ended but I think it‚Äôs worth watching through the end and make up your own mind about the finale.

For what it‚Äôs worth, it REALLY isn‚Äôt like Lost‚Äôs ending. The plot threads are concluded really tightly in that there are no gaps in the overall logic. It‚Äôs just a bit clumsily explained and there is a mystical element to the series which is actually revealed early on in the show."
Paranoia Agent,"It ties together better than Lost. Just remember that religious metaphors are there from the beginning and don't come out of left field in the last couple seasons like some people seem to think.

But no, it doesn't jerk you around the way Lost does, and the finale is generally much more satisfying."
Paranoia Agent,[deleted]
Paranoia Agent,The Cylons *definitely* didn't have a plan.
Paranoia Agent,The Cylons *definitely* didn't have a plan.
Paranoia Agent,"Even if the ending wasn't the ""best"" it at least made sense in the context of the world/story unlike LOST which was just nonsense fan service the entire last season. They did fuck up the Starbuck character proper though."
Paranoia Agent,Thanks a lot! Hope you enjoy as much as I have.
Paranoia Agent,"There‚Äôs a point each season where they drag with certain things, one of the problems of being a network show I think. But you missed out on an epic space battle when they escape the planet! One of my favorite scenes, and the show does have some great moments after that. But I think the first time I watched the show I skipped a couple episodes because that plot irritated me as well."
Paranoia Agent,">Balthazar 

Ah yes, good ol' Jared Balthazar."
Paranoia Agent,"You're not wrong. The show takes a massive dip in quality after Season 2.

Also the whole 'they have a plan' mystery thing was like Lost. They didn't have a plan at all, wrote season to season, and the end payoff was dreadful."
Paranoia Agent,"It‚Äôs a really good show, and gets better each season. The first one is the weakest while it gains its footing, I would say. One of those rare shows that ties up really well at the end. My only complaint would be that I didn‚Äôt love the characters as much as the movie, but the story is well told."
Paranoia Agent,the mutiny arc in the final season is IMO the best storyline of the whole series.
Paranoia Agent,"Nah, doesn't count, wasn't a pilot (it was part of a full 13 episode season order).

It is quite possibly the greatest season premiere episode of all time, though!"
Paranoia Agent,"I wish I could pick the brains of the showrunners to understand why they made certain choices.

I mean, 'God' was an element of the story all along, with Baltar seeing Six who talked about God having a plan. But even by the show's end, all 'God' ever did was nudge two characters to team up, and give someone a string of random numbers that miraculously worked. All the rest of the conflict was real-world stuff based on real decisions and consequences.

The ending was good. The only thing that let me down was that, from day one, their opening text said that the Cylons have a plan, as if it were something more obvious than ""Let's kill all the humans."" But they never had a plan. If you removed that line, I'd be okay with it."
Paranoia Agent,"I thought the first few episodes of season 3 were very good. The occupation storyline was timely given we were in the early stages of the Iraq War at the time. And depicting the ""good guys"" using suicide bombers? Gutsy writing.

But I recall there being a notable drop in quality after the episode ""collaborators"" once they were back on the ship, and IMO the show never really recovered. I'm surprised at how many people like the finale and how many times I see it on ""best tv ending of all time"" lists.

Personally, I think it's one of the worst I've ever seen."
Paranoia Agent,"Okay, i can accept that. But I must honestly say that I didn't ""grog"" BSG yet with the mini-series. But 33 was awesome and sold me on it."
Paranoia Agent,"It's all a big allegory about Mormonism. 

https://www.deseret.com/2014/11/22/20553208/mormon-creator-of-battlestar-galactica-dared-to-produce-something-profound"
Paranoia Agent,I think the word is grok.
Paranoia Agent,"I think you might be right. Grog is an alcoholic beverage, in Germany specifically we refer to it with a hot drink with rum, sugar and hot water, preferable drunken on Weihnnachtsmarkt. (That, or Feuerzangenbowle, made using a rum-soaked sugarloaf on fire that drips into mulled wine.)

Mustrum ""It all sounds kinda tasty, but I don't drink"" Ridcully"
Paranoia Agent,"I totally agree with your singling out of Kirsten Dunst in Fargo...her performance was incredible and definitely changed my opinion of her. Speaking of Fargo though, I would also recognize the actor who played Dodd. He was very intense, yet at the end [spoilers](/s ""when he was tied up,"") hilarious. "
Paranoia Agent,"Interesting that you single out Shiri Appleby from UnReal; I've been watching this and keep coming back for more, and I can't put my finger on why; I think she is one of the main reasons (aside from a good script and concept that could be terrible but is really well executed, and an all round good cast); her performance is a genuinely excellent character, always extremely interesting. First rate."
Paranoia Agent,"Eva Green is so perfect for Penny Dreadful, great to see her getting a mention here."
Paranoia Agent,[deleted]
Paranoia Agent,Walton Goggins in... anything.
Paranoia Agent,"If I had to say my favorites it would include Eliza Taylor (Clarke Griffin, The 100), Clark Gregg (Phil Coulson, Agents of SHIELD), Iain de Caestecker (Fitz, Agents of Shield), Elizabeth Henstridge (Jemma Simmons, Agents of Shield), and Rachel Bloom (Rebecca Bunch, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend). Every single one of these people just gave their all to their roles (especially Eliza Taylor and Clark Gregg) and really stood out this year."
Paranoia Agent,"Thanks! Dammit, forgot about the Silicon Valley cast. Haven't seen Broad City or Black-ish, gotta add those to my ""haven't seen"" list! So much good TV. "
Paranoia Agent,[deleted]
Paranoia Agent,"Cool thanks! And no, I like Girls but I guess I wouldn't single out any performances."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"That's huge news, hopefully they get to use *Fly Me To The Moon* since Netflix wasn't able to."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,YESSSSSSS INJECT THAT LCL DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINS
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Yes time for depression again
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"You know what's crazy. This is getting announced the week (technically this Wednesday) Japan is releasing the 25th anniversary boxset with the soundtracks from all this.

Both are exciting, but I'll wait and see on the Blu-Ray release. See whose subs/dubs it has on this release, and Fly Me to the Moon, of course."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I thought that said 4Kids for a second. Now there's a train wreck I'd like to see.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,But will we ever get the fourth Rebuild movie?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"It all keeps tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down...."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Never saw this classic anime series so hopefully i'll get the chance to when the blu-ray drops.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Awesome please have it on the original dub. I know it can be a bit janky at times. But the Netflix dub was infuriating at times. They had like 6 different pronunciations of Seele they said Selee Cell Zelle, Sell, selllaaa, seal, and don‚Äôt get me started on Nerv. Naaarv, Nearv, Nwerv, Nearerv. Pick one and stick to it please. üòÇ"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,What the fuck put 4.0 out already.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Okay, GKIDS has really turned out to the real MVP of anime distribution.

We still wouldn't have stuff like ""Only Yesterday"" if not for them."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Let‚Äôs hope they have the old dub as an option, but I doubt it‚Ä¶"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,One of the best series I have ever watched in any medium.  An absolute must watch.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Orange fanta

Orange fanta"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Awesome, But will it contain the original English Dub?
Because I don‚Äôt have any nostalgia for the this anime at all as I just saw it for the first time about 3 years ago with the original Dub and loved it, so I‚Äôve seen it about 3 times now.
I watched a bit of the Netflix English dub and did not like it a all, so I hope it doesn‚Äôt just have the Netflix dub."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,The End of Evangelion is worthy of being considered one of the best films ever made
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Which dub is it? Didn't notice it in the article, I hope it's the original?"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Let me get some of that sweet tang.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Kids should not watch this show
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Will it have the original dub? Thats all I care about
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Hopefully that includes EOE as well. Would love to see a crisp version of that on the blu Ray
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Thank you everyone for spending so much money on Promare GKIDS could afford this. I think I trust them with my life now (don't mess this up guys)
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"You know what else is getting its first-ever Blu-Ray release? The Irresponsible Captain Tylor!

https://www.rightstufanime.com/post/Captain-Tylor-Ultra-Edition

It's probably my favourite series of all anime. It's also the favourite series of the guy who owns Right Stuf, who basically decided ""It's my company so I can make a blu-ray of my favourite series if I want to."""
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I‚Äôm still waiting for that 4kids dub...
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"can‚Äôt wait, NGE is not only my favorite anime, but my favorite show ever too. hopefully this includes End of Evangelion, because that doesn‚Äôt have a Blu-ray either."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"wtf the most horrible yet magnificent movie, FOR KIDS ?!!"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Best. Animated. Series. Ever!!
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"I have a genuine question for the huge fanbase that is NGE.

So i have watched it all, subbed, watched the movie too, and 2nd movie? (Its been a minute)

It was good, but i reaalllyyy dont understand the hype, can someone explain what they loved about it that made it the cult classic it is today?

I loved the world building, i wish they had more of that. But all in all, i really don't get it the hype. Like the ending was wack asf, movie did nothing to help, it just talked about his mental struggles and ended, really left stuff hanging and the only cool thing was his relation to the mechs/why they are what they are but thats it. Help?"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"I watched this on Netflix over the Summer.

It made me confused and upset. I think I watched one movie after the series, but I don't remember it's title. I just remember being glad I was done with it."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I cant wait to not understand it in crystal clear HD
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I just this morning finished episode 24 and watched end of evangelion. What a series!
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Neon Genesis Evangelion is going to have a good 25th Anniversary.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"As an Evangelion fan, this is very good news. Looking forward to watching a Blu-Rei copy (heh)"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,A perfect series for 2020.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,How the FUCK is NGE for kids?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"I'd rather have this I guess since its the original and now on blu-ray.

But whatever happen to 4.44?? Is this Re-release and 2 movies taking priority now?"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,">GKIDS

So is this going to be a faithful release or are we gonna have Shinji spilling vanilla ice cream on Asuka?"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,If they can confirm that they‚Äôre using the original dub and Fly Me To The Moon is still in I would throw an irresponsible amount of money at them for this.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Uh, we've had blu-rays for a while. Fucking expensive as all get out, but they were out there."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"I just drove past an old crown vic this morning with the red head on the driver door. The artwork was good.

Sorry to early for me to remember her name."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,This is one anime that went over my head. Never could understand the hype over it.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Bluray, huh?  At this point, 4K HDR should be the default top priority, and people still living life with 1080p can settle for a downscale.  HDR being a key component here: These are filmed products, after all.  I have the _Cobra_ 4K bluray and it's fantastic.  Such a waste if they go through the effort to remaster this and then stick with a 10+ year old standard."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Are the releasing a new movie in the future? Man, the long stretches between updates makes you forget what decade it is..."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I've been meaning to see it but haven't got around to it. What is the definitive version of the series to watch?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"I tried to watch this series, I got halfway through and just couldn't continue 

Its super depressing and pervy"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Hooray!
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Looks like a salvia trip
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Congratulations
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Cool... I legit might actually buy if it is at a reasonable cost( which I doubt)
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Shouldn‚Äôt be going to kids I don‚Äôt think
Neon Genesis Evangelion,YES!
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Just tell me who I‚Äôm giving my money to and I‚Äôll do it
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"FUCKING FINALLY.

Also, japan has had the blu-rays for a while now, it's just outside that it's a problem."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,https://youtu.be/ToiWycAJhmc
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Welp guess I‚Äôm gonna have to watch it AGAIN :)
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Ok, but can we get 3.0+1.0 already?  That's what I'm waiting for.  (And I've got all the others on BD.)"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I still have no idea which version to watch and in what order....
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I can't wait for today's generation to relive the bullshit that was POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS that ended this original run.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Ahh man this is incredible news
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I'll stick with my custom platinum edition avchd from usenet.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyIpijrLlcM&ab_channel=eagle8burger
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Now, hopefully we can get them in Australia..."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Fly me to the moon...
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Can we get a new goddamn dub for it.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,We aren't getting the original voice cast are we?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Alright....I‚Äôll watch it
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I can‚Äôt watch the streaming neon genesis as it seems like different script from the original release so I have to go back to my dvds
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Does anyone know what dub will be on it for English?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Fuck Yes
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Please have good captions and ill buy it.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Just started watching Evil angel lion. Pretty good so far. No Angels or lions so far though.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Thank GOD
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Hopefully it will be better then Netflix's rerelease
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I thought neon genesis already had blu ray releases?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"instant purchase from me. just finished the anime & EoE. seriously life changing, especially on psychedelics lol"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"And to all the children...congratulations.

Neon Genesis Evangelion,"GKIDS is doing great work. Their recent releases of Satoshi Jon‚Äôs films were great, just when I was losing hope on ever seeing *Millennium Actress* in HD."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Fj
Neon Genesis Evangelion,CONGRATULATIONS
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Now do everything Netflix did wrong plz
Neon Genesis Evangelion,*I'm so fucked up*
Neon Genesis Evangelion,[deleted]
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"No OG dub, no buy."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,What's the general consensus on the dubs? Which dub is best? Which will most likely be on the bluray?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Finally! I may actually sit and watch it.

Still not watched this anime. Should I feel bad as I‚Äôve watched tonnes of other gainax anime"
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Can‚Äôt wait to listen to cicadas in HD
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Hope it‚Äôs not the edited Netflix version. Will wait to buy until I know
Neon Genesis Evangelion,It all returns to nothing
Neon Genesis Evangelion,*Outside of Japan
Neon Genesis Evangelion,[It's about Damn Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRd13-JxBkQ)
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Congratulations!
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Yaaaaaaas!
Neon Genesis Evangelion,G Kids is like the Criterion Collection for anime. So many good titles.
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Will it be the original dub/subs or what?
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Holy fuck finally
Neon Genesis Evangelion,I need Paranoia Agent on BR
Neon Genesis Evangelion,HOLY SHIT
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"I guess nothing says ""GKIDS"" like a cartoon where a bunch of people are murdered during wartime against existential monsters."
Neon Genesis Evangelion,Omg guy its such a great show i implore no one to watch it so im not associated with it
Neon Genesis Evangelion,"Awesome, can‚Äôt wait"
Mr. Iglesias,"At Netflix, for every show cancelled, 15 more shows get greenlit in their place."
Mr. Iglesias,I tried watching The Crew. I normally kind of enjoy Kevin James. I made it about 10 mins in. It was awful trash.
Mr. Iglesias,Netflix really needs to stop with these network sitcoms. They just don't work.
Mr. Iglesias,"Okay I was *just* browsing Netflix 20 minutes ago and did not see a thumbnail for any of those shows. Netflix, maybe if you'd actually fucking tell users that these shows exist, they'd do better?"
Mr. Iglesias,"I‚Äôm not surprised that The Crew and Country Comfort have been cancelled. I speculated as much when The Upshaws got renewed. All four of Netflix‚Äôs 2021 launched sitcoms bombed internationally. I think The Upshaws only got renewed as it would have looked awful to cancel Dad Stop Embarrassing Me, Black AF, and The Upshaws around the same time. I think The Upshaws benefited from Kenya Barris defecting to BET and the renewal of BlackAF being reversed. 

It means that Netflix have cancelled 3 out of the 4 comedies they have launched in 2021 and that is on top of only renewing 5 out of 18 comedies launched in 2020 (11 cancelled and 2 pending). Netflix doing awful with comedies lately!"
Mr. Iglesias,I really liked Bonding too.
Mr. Iglesias,Nooooooo. Bonding!
Mr. Iglesias,[removed]
Mr. Iglesias,"Bonding was honestly really good, and it was almost shocking how good it was, based on the interesting premise"
Mr. Iglesias,"The Crew was actually pretty funny.  Not surprised that Mr. Iglesias was canceled, Fluffy is funny on his specials, but that show was ass."
Mr. Iglesias,I really thought season 2 of bonding sucked unfortunatly whilst I loved the first one. I'm not too upset about the cancelation. They really went in a weird direction I think due to the criticism the show received which while fair it wasn't really thriving to be a documentary or something serious so they could've ignored some of it.
Mr. Iglesias,[removed]
Mr. Iglesias,"Netflix struck gold with One Day at a Time, and havent been able to match it at all since."
Mr. Iglesias,Anyone remember when Netflix had a reputation for generous renewals? Or did I just dream that?
Mr. Iglesias,Bonding season 1 is hilarious. However‚Ä¶did anyone watch season 2? I tried but only the first 10 minutes and then I must have got distracted. Report back‚Äîsnap!
Mr. Iglesias,"I have a conspiracy theory about netflix....

They quit making quality shows based in the US. Now they flood the app with foreign based shows to take advantage of cheaper labor/production costs.

Am I crazy?"
Mr. Iglesias,"Not surprised about The Crew (which was meh) because we hadn't heard anything in a while but DAMN IT, NOT COUNTRY COMFORT. I thought it was cute!"
Mr. Iglesias,Country comfort and the crew were not good but ill miss Eddie Cibrian. I liked Bonding though so that sucks. Never watches Mr. Iglesias.
Mr. Iglesias,"I quite enjoyed 'Bonding', little different and episodes shorter than a sit com 

The Crew didn't do anything for me, at all and genuinely not heard of the other two"
Mr. Iglesias,Damn. Bonding was good show. Guess I won‚Äôt be heading back to Netflix anytime soon
Mr. Iglesias,Stop taking first drafts of rejected ideas Netflix. For God's sake. They fired their last head of content and everything done since she was fired has been dogs hit.
Mr. Iglesias,"I actually really liked The Crew, I grew up on Nascar so the references hit a special place in me.  Sure it had its dumb sitcom moments but it really came together throughout.  And it wasn't pushing any agenda which was a breath of fresh air."
Mr. Iglesias,oohh.. this is bloodbath... i mean.. i just watched bonding here
Mr. Iglesias,Is there anything on Netflix? I canceled several months ago. It felt like I‚Äôd seen everything that interested me and there was a lot of filler.
Mr. Iglesias,Cmon man. Give Kevin james a break. Dudes sitcom gold
Mr. Iglesias,"Fluffy has been flattened!  I enjoyed the show, forgive the pun, but it was fluff, and that's OK.  I enjoy light formula shows once in a while.  Sorry it was canceled."
Mr. Iglesias,"this waterfall of content, that netfl;ix is doing clearly isnt working. id rather  take the quality that amazon, hbo and apple are putting out than the dime a dozen shit that netflix is"
Mr. Iglesias,Netflix is quantity over quality and in this age of near unlimited options quantity doesn't cut it. Quantity exists regardless of how much any one single service pumps out.
Mr. Iglesias,Bring back Travellers you poops. Y‚Äôall leavin us with a cliffhanger.
Mr. Iglesias,All are unwatchable so not surprising
Mr. Iglesias,"The Poor Man‚Äôs Formula 1 Drive to Survive, idk what NASCAR was thinking doing that. NASCAR is doing the Race for the Championship that sounds interesting tbh"
Mr. Iglesias,"Netflix follows the spaghetti approach, throw everything at a wall see what sticks. If and when it falls off later rinse and repeat. Not a terrible model but also sucks when you lose shows you like."
Mr. Iglesias,That's the Netflix formula it's about getting subscribers. The longer a show runs the less subscribers it pulls in. No use keeping a show on for longer than 3 years.
Mr. Iglesias,"They have a braid target audience. Not everything is going to work.

They do need to think about never having cliffhangers though. It‚Äôs terrible for their content in the long run because you can‚Äôt even recommend a single season show when I just ends."
Mr. Iglesias,"me too, the laugh track found it much funnier than I did"
Mr. Iglesias,I've never even heard of these shows. Netflix shows me the same five shows with different thumbnails over and over. It's not a good system
Mr. Iglesias,"Netflix basically operates like google: if the algorithm doesn't deem the content worthy for you, you'll never discover it on the ""first page""."
Mr. Iglesias,"They determine that if they did show it to you, there's a ~99% chance you wouldn't watch it. If they're wrong 1% of the time, they're still right 99% of the time."
Mr. Iglesias,"Do you (and other people) not realize that Netflix has a massive catalog so it tailors recommendations and surfaces shows as ‚Äúnew‚Äù or ‚Äúrecent‚Äù largely based on relevant watch history and not actually through the kind of massive ad push that a traditional network sitcom might enjoy? 

These shows failed because the demo they recommend the shows to didn‚Äôt take to them, not because they lacked wider audiences. 

If you didn‚Äôt see them, they likely weren‚Äôt meant for you."
Mr. Iglesias,They need you to watch their new Netflix original movie about the gay interracial couple facing off against the patriarchy
Mr. Iglesias,Seriously I‚Äôve been all over Netflix lately looking for stuff and I have no clue what any of the shows are from the titles and I also deep dive my way into the Wikipedia page with all the Netflix shows.ÔøºÔøº
Mr. Iglesias,"Bonding was marketed hard. The other 2, I saw mr Iglesias on the home page like twice. Never heard of the country one."
Mr. Iglesias,[deleted]
Mr. Iglesias,Hard to call those ‚Äúcomedies‚Äù anyways
Mr. Iglesias,Probably the first time i‚Äôve been mad at a netflix cancellation
Mr. Iglesias,"The way S2 ended was so sad, sucks that the show now ends on such a low note."
Mr. Iglesias,"Do you mind spoiling how it ended? I don't really want to watch it, but I'd like to know what made it so weird."
Mr. Iglesias,The writing was awful. I tried to watch two episodes and everything just felt so lame. Every joke fell flat. The characters were all irritating caricatures of people.
Mr. Iglesias,"I love Fluffy, and never knew this show even existed.

Might be part of the problem here Netflix."
Mr. Iglesias,"I loved season one of Bonding because I thought it took a lighthearted, cheeky look at kink while also throwing in some real, personal moments between Tiff and Peter.  Season two just got a little too overall dark tonally and I couldn‚Äôt finish it.    I feel like a lot of the fun left the show in favor of more serious storylines.  I don‚Äôt know if anyone else feels this way though."
Mr. Iglesias,"I think Mr. Iglesias, COULD have matched it with a little better writing. The look/feel fo the show matched One Day at a Time.

I liked the production, but the jokes were just really lame. Ugh!"
Mr. Iglesias,I think Netflix executives use cancelling shows as a substitute for Viagra.
Mr. Iglesias,"That was when they had like 10 shows total. Now they release 10 new ones every week, so canceling underperforming ones is a much easier choice."
Mr. Iglesias,Lot of the foreign shows are pretty good. Its just I feel like they like to cancel any show that has comedy in it. Any sitcom I was enjoying gets canceled.
Mr. Iglesias,It was doomed the minute they cast Eddie Cibrian. Has anything he done lasted more than a season?
Mr. Iglesias,"I know I'm wayyyyy late into this, but just found Country Comfort. My mom and I loved it. I wish there was another season!"
Mr. Iglesias,I realized the other day I watch a lot more Hulu now.
Mr. Iglesias,"I liked the production values. And it was almost funny to me. I just wish they had better writers. I did watch every episode tho! lol

Just surprised it made it this long."
Mr. Iglesias,Bro how do you cook spaghetti lol
Mr. Iglesias,[deleted]
Mr. Iglesias,See what sticks and throw that out too.
Mr. Iglesias,Wait really Netflix kept recommending me every single one of these. I've had The Crew ads for months on my frontpage and both Bonding and Mr.Iglesias keep showing up in my tabs
Mr. Iglesias,They don‚Äôt put enough resources into waiting.  Seinfeld woulda been cancelled after its first season if it was on Netflix.
Mr. Iglesias,_cries in Dark Crystal_
Mr. Iglesias,"Really liked season 1 but haven't looked season 2 yet, knowing it's been cancelled do you reckon it's worth starting?"
Mr. Iglesias,[removed]
Mr. Iglesias,Nobody good wants to work the Kevin James. Apparently he's a nightmare to work worth for show runners.
Mr. Iglesias,It would explain a lot.
Mr. Iglesias,"I agree, my mom has been really into ask the Korean dramas popping up on Netflix. I checked one out with her and the production level is way higher than any of the shows here that were just cancelled."
Mr. Iglesias,"I liked a lot of Netflix original series but these sound awful. All the Adam Sandler projects were garbage. They really lost me when they lost the kinds series that I enjoy putting on in the background, the office, friends, mash, etc."
Mr. Iglesias,He uses the Netflix approach
Mr. Iglesias,"The idea is that properly cooked spaghetti sticks to the wall, if it doesn't stick it's not al dente. Not sure if this method actually works though."
Mr. Iglesias,">  Job security doesn‚Äôt sound stable for crew members.

It's the same on all shows. At least they get a full season instead of being let go after half the season."
Mr. Iglesias,"This is the entertainment industry.  No guarantee your department will even be asked back if there is a season 2!  For me, as soon as a season wraps, it‚Äôs time to find the next job."
Mr. Iglesias,Yes it's part of their algorithm so it thinks you might enjoy these shows. Mine recommends me reality show which I pretty much hate except Bake Off.
Mr. Iglesias,Season 2 is good and in retrospect it feels like an ending but not particularly a happy one.
Mr. Iglesias,Link took me to the front page of reddit?
Mr. Iglesias,"Sorry hun', dinner is canceled"
Mr. Iglesias,"Great, indeed watched the first 4 episodes and I like it so far."
Mr. Iglesias,[deleted]
Mr. Iglesias,"What, did some old bigoted tweet from dinner resurface or something?"
Mr. Iglesias,you wouldn't break bread with those old farts.
Mr. Iglesias,They‚Äôd only cut the cheese.
Mr. Iglesias,I like Fluffy. It's just that seeing him in a 1980's sitcom is so disappointing.
Mr. Iglesias,Easy watch - I'll watch anything with Sherri Shepard after her role as Annie of Trial & Error.
Mr. Iglesias,Why?  Honestly this was like having a constant laugh track behind inane conversation.
Mr. Iglesias,Fantastic news. Binged it and was very entertained.
Mr. Iglesias,Yes!!!!
Mr. Iglesias,That's pretty cool. It was a nice easy watch. Nothing too amazing but enjoyable enough that I had on in the background while cooking or cleaning. I quite liked they made him a recovering alcoholic and how they dealt with it.
Mr. Iglesias,Yay
Mr. Iglesias,"Yesterday I spent an hour in my doctor's waiting room and they had this playing. As a teacher, and possibly because I was cranky waiting that long, I thought it was pretty bad haha"
Mr. Iglesias,They need to do season 2 like if it have a ending and pray so they get season 3.
Mr. Iglesias,[deleted]
Mr. Iglesias,"They get rid of so many great shows but keep this shit on.

They are now no better than traditional tv."
Mr. Iglesias,Good show. You don't forget the fact that this show is about Gabriel Iglesias and his relationship with the kids.
Mr. Iglesias,"That is more of his comedy lane though, more mass appeal. Most comics like that have landed in sitcoms, Seinfeld basically started it"
Mr. Iglesias,100%
Mr. Iglesias,I enjoyed it and its probably cheap to make
Mr. Iglesias,"You're not wrong, you're being downvoted because people disagree and rather than engage and prove you wrong they'd like to bury your opinion. 

The show just plain isn't funny, it has mass appeal i'll admit in being a family show one can watch with their kids, but it's funny in the way that Full House is funny. 

It's a rough show that wastes a talent like Gabriel and Sherri and puts them in a playdoh fun factory of comedy, compressing all that is good and funny into palatable cookie cutter shapes we have all seen before. 

That being said, I see why other people enjoy it, but i'm going to chalk this one up to ""not for me""."
Mr. Iglesias,The OA died so this show can probably have a dozen seasons...

Somewhere Only We Know,I mean Tbf we know the beats it‚Äôll take if you really want to get into spoilers.
Somewhere Only We Know,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs clears to a lot of people or not but they aren‚Äôt the stars or focus of the show, they‚Äôre just making cameos basically or guest appearances"
Somewhere Only We Know,"Kutcher:

>‚ÄùIt was really nostalgic to be back on the set. It‚Äôs all the same folks that made ‚ÄòThat ‚Äô70s Show,‚Äô so it was pretty bizarre.‚Äù

>‚ÄùMila and I were contemplating it. We thought, ‚ÄòListen, we‚Äôre only in the position that we‚Äôre in because of that show, so let‚Äôs just go back and do this. We just went back and had fun for a week. It was so random and fun.‚Äù"
Somewhere Only We Know,"To me the big news is they already filmed!

>‚ÄúIt was really nostalgic to be back on the set,‚Äù Kutcher told Variety‚Äôs Carson Burton at the red carpet premiere of ‚ÄúVengeance‚Äù at the Ace Hotel in Los Angeles Monday evening. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all the same folks that made ‚ÄòThat ‚Äô70s Show,‚Äô so it was pretty bizarre.‚Äù"
Somewhere Only We Know,"> The series, set in 1995,

Perhaps learned their lesson from starting in late '76 the first time around."
Somewhere Only We Know,">Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp are returning from the original cast to once again play Red and Kitty.

That's all I needed to know, I'm on board with this."
Somewhere Only We Know,‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt sleep in the same bed as someone and not be doing it‚Äù-Michael Kelso
Somewhere Only We Know,"Met Kutcher at my job, dude is humble as fuck. Wasn‚Äôt even sure it was him he was trying to be incognito. I said ashton? He looked up and I said mind if I get a pic my kid won‚Äôt believe me, he didn‚Äôt skip a beat."
Somewhere Only We Know,"I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic, I know it‚Äôs starts in 1995, but I‚Äôd love at least 4 season to get Eric‚Äôs reaction to The Phantom Menace."
Somewhere Only We Know,"I‚Äôll definitely give it a shot, really hoping it‚Äôs good  because that 70s show was really a terrific show at its best, will always have great memories of watching that show growing up. Anyway Ashton Kutcher seems like a good dude, may not be the best actor around but I‚Äôm a fan"
Somewhere Only We Know,"That‚Äôs actually a pretty reasonable approach to take, good for them. Yeah it‚Äôs probably ‚Äúbeneath them‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not going to hurt them and it‚Äôs a way to show some gratitude for the opportunities they‚Äôve had because of the show. Often you hear stories about actors who refuse to even discuss the shitty show where they got their start because they‚Äôre a ‚Äúserious actor‚Äù now‚Ä¶"
Somewhere Only We Know,"I remember one of the first times I heard him in an interview.  To that point, he'd been this dopy character on That 70's Show.  They'd asked him about his future.  His answer surprised me (paraphrasing):  

>I got lucky, my parents gave me their best and I've been able to get by on that for a while, but that's going to run out soon and I need to figure that out.  

He basically said he's been able to coast on his good looks, but that's not a long term plan.  Then came some punk'd, time behind the camera and now...a human rights org?  

Dude is way deeper than he appeared at first blush."

Somewhere Only We Know,"https://www.eonline.com/amp/news/1338810/wilmer-valderrama-teases-his-appearance-on-that-70s-show-spin-off

>In Netflix's *That ‚Äò70s Show* spin-off, *That ‚Äò90s Show*, the daughter of Eric (Topher Grace) and Donna (Laura Prepon) spends a summer with her grandparents, Red and Kitty Forman (Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp) in Wisconsin.

>Grace, Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama, Ashton Kutcher, and Mila Kunis are set to reprise their respective roles. As for how many episodes they'll appear in? That's still to be determined.

>New kids include Callie Haverda as Leia Forman, Ashley Aufderheide as Gwen, Reyn Doi as Ozzie, Maxwell Acee Donovan as Nate, Sam Morelos as Nikki, and Mace Coronel as Jay.

Conspicuously absent: Danny Masterson."
Somewhere Only We Know,"Said Kurtwood Smith, ""Speak for yourself, Dumbass."""
Somewhere Only We Know,I love a man who can express gratitude.
Somewhere Only We Know,I hope Hyde died of a drug overdose in the 80s.
Somewhere Only We Know,Holy shit he looks like Charlie.
Somewhere Only We Know,He‚Äôs such a good man
Somewhere Only We Know,i was in highschool and college in the 1990s. so its my prime decade. i never considered the 90s to have had a distinct culture to it like the 70s.
Somewhere Only We Know,These two are super awesome. Such an inspiring couple.
Somewhere Only We Know,I wonder if they‚Äôll keep the laugh track
Somewhere Only We Know,As fucked up as it is to say‚Ä¶ this show wont be the same without Hyde.
Somewhere Only We Know,Maybe we can get That 70s Show back on Netflix now?
Somewhere Only We Know,It should be that 2000 show
Somewhere Only We Know,"For a moment I was confused because I thought the actors would have to be artificially aged to be set in the modern era of the 90s.

Then I got really...really depressed."
Somewhere Only We Know,Does anyone else find it hilarious that Eric managed to convince Donna to name their daughter Leia?  Wonder what he had to bribe her with?  She must really love that guy.
Somewhere Only We Know,"I wish That 80's Show had been better and taken off, but I think the writing just wasn't quite there and the timing wasn't quite right."
Somewhere Only We Know,Something to be said for loyalty. Hopefully the show doesn‚Äôt suck
Somewhere Only We Know,Cant wait to hear kitties laugh again
Somewhere Only We Know,It blew my mind when someone pointed out we are now the same distance from the 70s when that show came out as we are from the 90s now. Damn.
Somewhere Only We Know,"on a side note, wish the That 80's Show wasn't cancelled. it had Denis from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia."
Somewhere Only We Know,When does it air and what channel?
Somewhere Only We Know,I will subscribe to Netflix to binge this show and then cancel immediately afterwards
Somewhere Only We Know,When is the Hyde cameo?
Somewhere Only We Know,"Good on him, can‚Äôt wait to see it!"
Somewhere Only We Know,what on earth would Kutcher's character be up to in the 90's?
Somewhere Only We Know,Is Hyde coming back?
Somewhere Only We Know,I hope they make 2 and a half shows
Somewhere Only We Know,Remember when they tried that 80s show for like two weeks? Does she was gonna fall flat on his face‚Ä¶ Now that I think about it? It‚Äôll probably be a smash it.
Somewhere Only We Know,Just get I'm the car Jackie
Somewhere Only We Know,"Has his career cooled though?  He never seemed like someone who would have this mindset, but is perhaps using this to look humble with his return.  I'm sure he's still wealthy enough to not need it, but as far as acting, I felt he tried to make a serious turn with Jobs and never went anywhere after.  Granted, I don't know anything about The Ranch.

But if you asked me in the early 2000s how big would Ashton Kutcher be, I'd have said pretty big, and he seems hardly relevant today."
Somewhere Only We Know,"‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for That 70s Show, Danny Masterson never would‚Äôve been able to join scientology, Topher Grace never would‚Äôve gotten to be in a Tobey Maguire Spiderman movie, and Mila and I wouldn‚Äôt have this huge platform to push NFTs!‚Äù

Wow, I‚Äôm so grateful."
Somewhere Only We Know,Maybe he‚Äôd be in a different position if he took a shower
Somewhere Only We Know,Who gives a shit? Stop worshiping celebrities
Somewhere Only We Know,Who gives a shit? Stop worshiping celebrities
Somewhere Only We Know,"No interest in a sequel series full of cameos or references 

I rarely even rewatch that 70s show I liked it and all.  Have a few episodes I adore Jackie holding the flashlight for red still gets me 

And no Hyde 

Pass"
Somewhere Only We Know,Yet another cash grab remake that nobody asked for.
Somewhere Only We Know,Thisll be trash
Somewhere Only We Know,But the 90s sucked.
Somewhere Only We Know,The 90s just don't seem like a time many people really fondly look back on.
Somewhere Only We Know,I never saw what was so great about the original show.  Never made me laugh once.
Somewhere Only We Know,That‚Äôs literally the only way a spin-off can exist yes
Somewhere Only We Know,It was a fun show. Unfortunately it‚Äôs forever tainted so that will be a giant no thank from me on any and all spin-offs and reboots.
Somewhere Only We Know,Didnt they make this already? With friends and seinfeld?
Somewhere Only We Know,"Thus just show that Hollywood is done, no more good and new ideas"
Somewhere Only We Know,No. No no no what are you doing?! This shows going to be fucking trash
Somewhere Only We Know,Thanks captain obvious.
Somewhere Only We Know,"LOL...wasn't Kutcher Masterson's wingman for like 10 years?

I'm sure his hands are completely clean and he knew nothing, though."
Somewhere Only We Know,It‚Äôs better than me getting my foot out of your ass dumbass
Somewhere Only We Know,"""The only reason they want us to appear on the spinoff is because we were in the original!""

....fucking duh?"
Somewhere Only We Know,Is Kutcher a big star?
Somewhere Only We Know,"There‚Äôs honoring your past, and there‚Äôs career suicide. Don‚Äôt attach yourself to this warmed over trash Ashton."
Somewhere Only We Know,I'm betting on them being a super bitter divorced couple.
Somewhere Only We Know,The answer is money not this idiotic response.
Somewhere Only We Know,"I mean, yeah. That‚Äôs kind of how revivals work lol"
Somewhere Only We Know,"Everything old Ashton says feels like there should be a tiny clown that comes out from behind him afterwards to say ‚Äúuh, duh‚Äù to the idiots who didn‚Äôt already assume it"
Somewhere Only We Know,"70s was an amazing time period relating to todays adults‚Ä¶the 90s?

Thats an epic shitshow relating to todays troubled wanna-be adults.

Pure fail icm"
Somewhere Only We Know,"In other words, Ashton invested way too much in crypto/NFT‚Äôs and need some cash flows lol"
Somewhere Only We Know,This is written for Baby Boomers born between 1946 to 1964. Pass.
Somewhere Only We Know,W
Somewhere Only We Know,Kevin wear your hair properly
Somewhere Only We Know,Loyalty
Somewhere Only We Know,"It‚Äôs going to be a huge flop. People like ‚Äúera‚Äù shows to see the pop culture references of when they were teenagers. These actors were all young with something to prove and full of goofy energy. If this show succeeds, it would have to get a new set of young actors with great charisma and synergy, which it sounds like is not the case."
Somewhere Only We Know,Well that‚Äôs obvious
Somewhere Only We Know,Never forget your roots‚Ä¶ much respect!
Somewhere Only We Know,"What position is that, Buns up kneeling?"
Somewhere Only We Know,I still miss that show
Somewhere Only We Know,"If anyone's wondering where's that 80s show, they did try it and it lasted 1 season."
Somewhere Only We Know,That is how time works.
Somewhere Only We Know,"Writers, get ready to dust off and recycle the fuck out of those old catch phrases! It's what we ""The Studio"" think everyone has to hear a million times for this to be successful."
Somewhere Only We Know,Also money.
Somewhere Only We Know,###Respect. üëçüèºüëçüèº
Somewhere Only We Know,"Pretty humble response, actually."
Somewhere Only We Know,[deleted]
Somewhere Only We Know,All hail the king
Somewhere Only We Know,Can someone please ask him or the writers what the eff was that announcement about the tornado and the young man in critical condition? Never seen it directly asked to anyone
Somewhere Only We Know,"I need to see him in a few episodes, he literally is hilarious"
Somewhere Only We Know,Jackie made him do it
Somewhere Only We Know,Remember when they did ‚ÄòThat 80s Show‚Äô?
Somewhere Only We Know,Damn they‚Äôre bringing back Kelso?? I might watch this
Chief of Staff,"I love this show so much. I watch my favorite episodes every 2 or three years.

Window of opportunity <3"
Chief of Staff,This show made the US military look sooo good.
Chief of Staff,I miss Hammond of Texas.
Chief of Staff,"The best bit was General Ryan was on the DVD commentary, and they asked him if they actually had Colonels like O'Neill in the Air Force.

He replied ""Oh yes, and worse."""
Chief of Staff,They also had a cameo from General John P. Jumper. So that's two Chief of Staffs.. Chiefs of Staff? However you say that.
Chief of Staff,Honorary Brig. Gen. !? That's pretty fucking cool
Chief of Staff,"'Mr President we have found a portal to other worlds!'


:'incredible, but who best to take over the project?'


'Well the portal sends people on foot to dense woodlands and is in no way big enough for any form of aircraft. It is ideal for infantry and scouts.'


:'excellent give it to the air force then.'



'Wut?'"
Chief of Staff,Now I‚Äôm breaking out the dvd collection and starting from the beginning again....
Chief of Staff,"Stargate is a documentary, if you think I'm crazy- that too is explained in the wormhole extreme episode, RDA got a real rank because it's a military propaganda machine to cover for what's really happening... "
Chief of Staff,Given the stuff they pulled on that show I could completely believe that RDA didnt k ow it was gonna be the REAL guy so his reaction was genuine.
Chief of Staff,"I keep wanting to rewatch this, but so many seasons, it just seems like a bit undertaking."
Chief of Staff,"Some of the better episodes seemed to be when they included things from the military like when he was captured by Ba'al and was asked, ""so you're THE Jack O'Neil"""
Chief of Staff,Is star gate any good?
Chief of Staff,I loved the bit of fangirling O‚ÄôNeil does ‚ÄúI love the air force‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt realize it was the REAl chief of staff tho!! So cool!
Chief of Staff,"I want that show back.

Firs. Finish SGU. Then make SG1 a thing again. After that, a nice different spin on the whole thing and done. "
Chief of Staff,"The show pretty much always treated the us military with respect. I think that they had assistance from the military and in order to get their cooperation, your scripts have to be vetted so they don't show the military in a bad light.

I find it funny though that basically the general had to come to Canada to do his cameo."
Chief of Staff,This just reminded me of what the newer attempts at Star Gate have been missing. It's basically a military comedy/drama. 
Chief of Staff,"I'm in season 7 currently, and I wish Jonas Quinn would have had more time than he did."
Chief of Staff,Man I fucking miss this show.
Chief of Staff,"I just rewatched SG-1, I dont think I should do it again this year..."
Chief of Staff,"I heard a theory that STARGATE was actually an outlet for the US military to spread disclosure about the truth about Aliens. Apparently it was one of many projects that was based on true events,to get humanity ready for the day the truth was revealed. Allegedly."
Chief of Staff,"I regret that I've never watched Stargate, beyond the original movie.  

Spader was so good in that, when he wasn't cast for the series I just noped out. But RDA has always been a favorite."
Chief of Staff,Man i miss jack and the gang..... üòë best thing to ever come out of the 90s
Chief of Staff,I totally missed this when I watched it the first time through. I just thought it was kind of a weird thing.
Chief of Staff,Best show ever 
Chief of Staff,They really gave him a softball performance though. All he had to do was just stand there and smile and be an affable General.
Chief of Staff,Does it seem plausible that such a casual person would rise up the ranks in the military? 
Chief of Staff,"Everyone always goes straight for the backswing line no one ever mentions the juggling scene or ""teal'c how far is alaris?"" ""Several billion miles"" ""oh ya that'll play"""
Chief of Staff,Damn I wish Richard Dean anderson's health was better and he would start acting again :( I miss him
Chief of Staff,I have a hard time believing that a guy who has met literal gods would be star struck by a General. 
Chief of Staff,"Which, along with a paper clip and some chewing gum, he was able to make an explosive device so he could thwart the kidnappers. "
Chief of Staff,"This show ruined the new God of War. I just can't imagine Kratos as anything other than Teal'c years after Stargate, on another world, trying to forget everything and move on with life.

God I miss this show."
Chief of Staff,"I used to watch the show growing up but it was dubbed in french. Always funny and confusing to hear an original version for the first time.

Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis were the shit back then. If only an Halo tv show could fill the void the show left..."
Chief of Staff,After playing through the new God of War I've been wanting to watch this through again. We do not get enough Christopher Judge.
Chief of Staff,Hands down my favorite sci-fi show of all time.
Chief of Staff,I miss that show.. 
Chief of Staff,"Being a celebrity must be class. Like hey, you‚Äôre famous, have a certificate for something you never really did. Even tho you can actually just afford it"
Chief of Staff,"unrelated, should I watch universe or let it rot in hell?"
Chief of Staff,I have been working my way through the series and my next episode just started with this scene. Spooky.
Chief of Staff,"SG1 is easily one of my favourite shows of all time. Same with Atlantis. I really need to rewatch them again, it's been too long."
Chief of Staff,I want a new Stargate program but with the CIA in charge not the Air Force. Think like Homeland but throughout the Galaxy. 
Chief of Staff,Awesome show. 
Chief of Staff,"Don't forget the first astronaut on Star Trek:

https://www.themarysue.com/mae-jemison-star-trek-tng/"
Chief of Staff,"As much as I love stargate I have to say, that whole episode was just an ad for the air force."
Chief of Staff,"Honorary rank of BG?!

What the fuckity fuck is that about?? How insulting to every person who has every put on a uniform.

I watched Stargate when I was younger. It was...alright.  
I watched MacGuyver. It was a good show.  

But neither of them warrant getting an honorary rank of one of the highest officer ranks there is.  
Just because he was a god damn actor!

This might be the stupidest thing I've seen today."
Chief of Staff,[deleted]
Chief of Staff,His reaction was unatural and cheesy
Chief of Staff,‚ÄúIn the middle of my backswing!‚Äù
Chief of Staff,I'm right now rewatching Atlantis just saw general O'Neil swim underwater to deflood a jumper bay
Chief of Staff,"I was honestly quite shocked when I got to university and found out everyone didn‚Äôt love it - it was pretty huge in my high school.  So from season 5 on it was mostly me and 2 other nerds watching on a 14‚Äù TV each week lol, good times! 

Yeah I‚Äôm with you; I probably rewatch most of them about every year and a half to 2 years. I can‚Äôt really explain why I like it so much, I‚Äôm generally quite picky with sci-fi and usually don‚Äôt go out of my way to rewatch shows, but something about this and Atlantis (though Atlantis took a while to grow on me) really got to me! 


... guess the next rewatch will happen sooner than scheduled! "
Chief of Staff,bad example
Chief of Staff,That has to be the best episode in all of Stargate
Chief of Staff,Same! Love that episode so much. The way Teal'c starts his cycle is hilarious. 
Chief of Staff,Window of Opportunity?  That‚Äôs a funny way to spell 200.
Chief of Staff,"Where do you watch it? Or do you just own the series?

I've been wanting to rewatch it for a while but it seems it's not netflix or anything and that StarGate Command thing can only be watched through a web browser."
Chief of Staff,"Anyway, I'm sorry, but that's just how I feel about it. What do you think?"
Chief of Staff,"That's my favourite episode because he finally fucking kisses carter


And the teal'c door slam"
Chief of Staff,[God that is such a good episode.](https://i.imgur.com/ZrsK6j4.gifv)
Chief of Staff,"""Anyway, I'm sorry, but that just happens to be how *I* feel about it. What do you think?"""
Chief of Staff,"Honestly, I don't get why this episode is so loved. I rewatched it a few months ago, and found it was merely decent. I get that people think it's funny, and there's the emotional sting near the end, but I'm mystified that it's considered the best episode of the franchise."
Chief of Staff,"For a total newb, in what order would you recommend watching them? "
Chief of Staff,It was basically run by the Air Force.  They controlled scripts the same way the Navy did with Top Gun.  
Chief of Staff,And didn't need a lousy space farce to do it.
Chief of Staff,Indeed! 
Chief of Staff,"You, with the crown of marble."
Chief of Staff,_pats top of head_
Chief of Staff,Indeed.
Chief of Staff,Haha brilliant.
Chief of Staff,"Ahaha, I watched the DVD extras over like 10 years ago and you brought back memories here, I remember that exact moment :)"
Chief of Staff,"SG1 was terrific positive promotion for the USAF. The combination of derring-do, empathy and compassion was almost WW2-esque in its portrayal of positive American values."
Chief of Staff,"Yes, he was scheduled to make a second appearance but then America invaded Afghanistan and Iraq and he was busy."
Chief of Staff,Chiefs of staves
Chief of Staff,Feels like they missed out on the biggest opportunity of all time by not putting John P Jumper in a Puddle Jumper.
Chief of Staff,Chiefses of all the staffs
Chief of Staff,Chief ofs Staff
Chief of Staff,Especially since RDA is Canadian.
Chief of Staff,"They have the most nerds and space stuff. Also Cheyenne Mountain Complex is run by the Airforce. Navy would have used it as an anchor, the Army as a wheel, and the Marines as target practice."
Chief of Staff,"Umm yeah, because the air force is what handles space stuff for us outside of nasa."
Chief of Staff,"The original premise was that it was a large object called the Door to Heaven that looked big enough for people to walk through. It made sense to have the Air Force provide military support, since aerospace research and development in a military context is the domain of the Air Force.

The Air Force also maintains ground-based special operations forces. The original recon team was composed of airmen."
Chief of Staff,"Well, other worlds are technically in the sky."
Chief of Staff,"More to do with the fact a lot of science is done by the Air Force with the Navy a close second. That's a lot of why a lot of astronauts were former Air Force and Navy both because of their flight history, and because both services have a LOT of scientists amoung them. "
Chief of Staff,"To be fair there were actually Marine teams and members of the SGC. SG-3, SG5, and SG-18 all had Marines at one point or another. And there is at least one US army member. "
Chief of Staff,They did actually send planes through the gate sometimes. And it's not the Air Force's fault that every planet looks like it's in British Columbia
Chief of Staff,"I have every season and all of the movies, including the original big screen movie. "
Chief of Staff,Fuckin a brother 
Chief of Staff,"What happens in wormhole extreme, pray tell?"
Chief of Staff,"Meh, doesn't take as long as you would think. I rewatch SG1 and Atlantis in there entirety every few years. Still a great show"
Chief of Staff,"It always feels like that, but by the time I've finished SG-1 and the movies + Atlantis + Universe, it's 3 months later and I'm mad that there aren't *more* episodes, all because stupid SyFy allowed such an incredible series to die for no reason. 


"
Chief of Staff,"You're not forced to watch all in one go.

Do it season by season, and take a break whenever you feel you need one."
Chief of Staff,I've been binge-watching it on Hulu for the last week or two. Just started season 8. I've had it on while I do whatever other thing (like Redditing). It's been worth it.
Chief of Staff,You can just watch up to season 6 of SG-1. That's the best part and you get the full experience.
Chief of Staff,"""No, two L's!"""
Chief of Staff,How is that bit related to the military? It's just a nod to the movie.
Chief of Staff,yes.
Chief of Staff,"Absolutely. You'll get varying opinions on when the golden years of SG1 were, and whether SGU ranks above or below Atlantis, but overall it's a great franchise. "
Chief of Staff,Greatest sci-fi series in history. Longest running too. Made more episodes of the original than any other sci-fi series ever. If you are a fan of sci-fi I could not more strongly recommend starting with the pilot episode and watching them all !!!!
Chief of Staff,It's really good. You can tell that the people working on the show enjoyed what they were doing
Chief of Staff,"If you enjoy light-hearted sci-fi, yes absolutely. "
Chief of Staff,"The cgi doesn‚Äôt hold up well at all, but the writing and chemistry between the characters was fantastic "
Chief of Staff,"I'll point out, watch the movie first, it sets up the tv series and a couple of characters come across, despite being new actors.

You can start with S1E1 but seeing the movie helps you with call backs in season 1."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Can‚Äôt wait to see all the terror, chaos and war crimes being committed in season 2. Season 1 laid down the perfect groundwork for the show to really take off in the coming seasons."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Hope young Rhaenyra and Luke actors get cool new HBO projects. They were great
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,That chase nearly gave me a heart attack. Thrilling Westerosi madness at its finest.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Start of the season: NOT INTERESTED
Ep 1: Sign me up
Ep 10. WAIT 2 YEARS HOW DARE YOU"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,That scene with Otto Hightower and Rhaenyra was seriously beautifully written and performed.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Numbers are already massive and this season was a setup season. Imagine the numbers when the dance reaches its peak
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"despite people saying hbo is amazing and prestigious, the truth is that the majority of their shows do not get viewers. an amazing show like succession only had 2 million viewers in the last season finale"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,pretty solid finale
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,[deleted]
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I wonder if the ""No one is going to watch this after season 8"" people have been following along weekly?"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Even with the leak. Well done HBO.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"While i love this show, i get sad when they talk about the song of fire and ice knowing how it ends :("
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I‚Äôm digging it, Emma is a crazy talented actor and that final scene was epic."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,">Without giving an exact number of viewers, WBD did confirm exclusively to Variety that overall viewership including both cable and streaming rose by 5% with Episode 4, by 3% with Episode 5 and by another 3% with Episode 6. (The company declined to share any information about viewership of episodes 7-9.)

That stat stuck out to me a bit. You'd assume this means episodes 7-9 saw the audience dropping off a bit, which would be a shame since that's kind of when the show was really kicking into high gear. Episode 6 was a bit of a hump to get over though since that's when the 10-year time jump happened (even the showrunners have said it was almost like making a second pilot episode), so I could imagine that causing some people to drop off."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I mean it‚Äôs just such a good show.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Pretty impressive viewership numbers considering the NFL and MLB playoffs were going on. This was such a fantastic start to the series that it sets up future seasons so well. They've nailed the characters and brought the hype back for the GOT universe while still setting this show up on it's own. Can't wait for the next season!
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Spoilers obviously 

This show did a great job of setting up two trains headed straight for each other while also establishing that there was really no way this could have been avoided 

Well, of course there was ways to stop this train *technically*. 

They could have done a great council like they did to pick Viserys, either one of the ladies could have backed down several times throughout the first season, and it was clear that neither of the matriarchs really wanted bloodshed. They hated each other, but until the last scene they didn‚Äôt want to murder each other‚Äôs families 

But ineffective communication and every character‚Äôs disregards of viewpoints that aren‚Äôt their own guarantees that none of these safe exits are taken. 

None of these actions were ever gonna be taken by these feudal lords, even if they do briefly consider it

Small problems left to sit until they grew into massive problems. Would have been way easier to fix in episode 2 or 3, and now in episode 10 those problems grew so great that these two trains slowly heading towards each other have too much momentum to avoid a massive crash"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"This show is gonna be great but the names are frustratingly hard to learn. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Larry and this is my brother Darryl, and this is my other brother Darryl‚Äù"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Just want to point out that this show was very female- centric and diverse without being preachy and insulting its audience‚Ä¶ instead it was an ABSOLUTE DELIGHT‚Ä¶ Disney/Marvel take notes!!
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Once again we see that it wasn‚Äôt HBO that ruined GoT, it was D&D."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"For those who‚Äôve read the books, how much content do they have with Dance of the Dragons? Is there enough there to weave a tight 5 season show or less?"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Every fucking episode was a banger. Can‚Äôt wait for S2.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I'm only at episode 3. I loved it so far. But it's nice to see good comments about the whole season. I feel that it didn't have the same level of marketing than GoT, but if the quality is here it's all that matter."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"If I want to watch this with my wife and have not seen the game of thrones series, will it make sense?"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I hope the expected amount of action in season 2 doesn't take away from the characters and drama. The best moments of this season did not happen on dragonback.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"It started at 9.9 and ended at 9.3, which is the first time Game of Thrones season is lower at the finish than at the beginning.

This season still the 3rd most watched season in the history of the franchise, only behind GOT Season 7 (10.1-12.1) and Season 8 (11.8-13.6)

It is comparable to Season 6 (7.9-8.9)"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Wow even after the leaks?
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Game of Thrones finale May 19, 2019

So, 3 years, 5 months.

With a pandemic in between, shutting down most productions. 

Was there any show in between that would even come close?"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"After how GoT ended I really didn't think I would be able to get into this. Hell I haven't watched a single second of GoT since the ending & probably never will. This show though, god damn did it ever reel me in. They've done an incredible job & I can't wait for more."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Now do rings of power üíÄ
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Just in the US, right?"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Would have been higher if it wasnt for the leak.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"This is a series that I'm actually anticipating a season 2.
LotrRoP can eat a bag of busted assholes."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Kinds amazing how wrong reddit was about this show. All I heard was how terrible it would be and nobody cares about GoT anymore.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Genuinely enjoyed the show. Little slow, yes, but it's gonna pay off, I believe."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Biggest finale since that one a couple years ago lol
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I am really excited for season 2.

IF season 1 was laying the ground work.

Because it honestly felt like watching ""the bold and the beautiful"" in fantasy settings if it isn't"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I was one of them
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,[deleted]
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Viewership was down from the premiere, then. GOT had a bigger finale than premiere for all 8 seasons. HOTD does drag, so this is not surprising."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Its funny how every single even just slightly negative opinion here gets swiftly downvoted.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I wonder if the numbers would be significantly higher if not for the leak?
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I stopped watching about 5 episodes in. I just didn‚Äôt care  about any of the characters. first season of GOT i was invested in many, even ones i hated. Here was just apathy. Might go back and watch later some time but really disappointed."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I'm going to have to watch season one again just to figure out who the hell everyone was.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I think some of the haterade comes from  fantasy lovers that wanted to be cast in the show. Seeing the epic wardrobes (way better than Amazon cosplay stuff), epic locations, handsome men and beautiful women they want it‚Ä¶.they need it. 

So they go passive projection to quench the fire which is haterade. 

Get a agent."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,It‚Äôs not even that good
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"My only question is, how does Daemon receive word of Lucery's death? 

Oh and did Aemond really stick a diamond into his eye socket? That's metal asf"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I haven't seen this yet. Is this show better than RoP?

Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Its an odd show.  S1 had its moments but if it hadn‚Äôt been released as a GoT franchise story, it‚Äôd have lukewarm reception at best.  

When you have such a narrow scope of characters, and so many of them are unlikable, the writing needs to be pretty great, and this is one place the show lags a bit.  Maybe later seasons will really deliver."

Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Pretty good show, first half was stronger then the second and they made some pretty questionable decisions with the lore but I am still excited for season 2"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I'm sorry but HOTD is nothing compared to GOT. The conflict has been dragged out all season with a few anonymous characters killed off. There is no humor like GOT and the characters are incredibly dull. Matt Smith is holding the show together by a thread. The only interesting event in the whole season happened in the last 10 minutes.

EDIT: Downvoting me won't silence the truth!"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,Tbh I don't really care about this show. I'll probably finish it eventually here but I just couldn't be bothered to tune in while it was airing.
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,I‚Äôm truly under the impression people don‚Äôt know what good tv is and I‚Äôve just accepted that. I‚Äôm no perfect critic but the shows pacing and story are just bad. It‚Äôs just so in your face. No real twists or ideas to challenge you what‚Äôs so ever. It‚Äôs just simple so I guess that‚Äôs what people like about it. So be it.

Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Wow, wtf thats the first season over with? Nothing fuckin happened! That sucked"
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,The finale was a bit weak imo - I think they tried too hard to setup the ‚Äúspark‚Äù for Dance of the Dragons with Luke‚Äôs death. Plus I hate that they made Aemond all regretful over killing Luke. He‚Äôs wanted that revenge for years so I expected him to be laughing maniacally after the kill.

Awake: The Million Dollar Game,The show isn't even that good. I don't know why I watched it. The hype I guess. Whelp!
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"I haven't started it yet. I'm caught between not caring anymore and still wanting some GoT content. 

GoT really stunk at the end - and it ruined the show for me. I know some people can watch select seasons from a series and be okay with it - but I can't. It ruined the entire series for me. I can't sit down and watch a show I know isn't going to pay off.

I hope this one stays strong. But I have a feeling I'll be waiting for a few more seasons to see if it keeps the quality."
Awake: The Million Dollar Game,"Binged it one sitting. Found the season meh. Too many timeskips. After the Rhaenyra actress change I lost interest and began fast forwarding a lot. 

I am intrigued though by what will transpire in the coming seasons, but based on my understanding of the history of Westeros discussed in the GoT show as a non-book reader, Rhaenyra will not have a good time regardless of whether she becomes the legit queen or not. If she goes through a Daenerys type character development arc of innocent-bad ass-ruler-insane it'll be disappointing for me. 

I also found it interesting that Daemon was the most relatable of all the main characters for me. Dude is an asshole but genuine. The actor playing him is amazing."

Unit 42,There was very little about this year's cancellations that surprised me.
Unit 42,"Yeah as a fan I hope your right this is all leading to something, but honestly I have to admit I'm not as confident as you their is a big plan.

But honestly I'm just losing faith in Chinbnall. He's got miles under his belt and written some good episodes for the show in the past. But to his overall plans I'm less confident.

I recently discovered that when he brought the Silurians back he originally wanted to reveal that they had always looked his new redesign and that in all their previous appearances they had just been wearing costumes.

Now I might be biased as I don't like the redesign, but to me that sounds an utterly terrible. Even getting past the fact that is kind of a smack in the face to what is a generally beloved part of the shows history, why on earth would they deliberately go around dressed up to look more inhuman even when alone with their own kind?

Considering the parallels this creates to his Timeless Child idea now their is no one to reign him in.

Plus if his big plan is to have her get one real big take down against the Time Lords, it would probably work better if he didn't just suddenly kill them off again before we got a chance to be introduced to them again?

So yeah I hope your right. I hope this is building somewhere. Heck it might be interesting to go against the previous seasons argument that the doctor had to much of a god complex and that she really should do more.

But I'm not holding my breath."
Unit 42,"Sorry, but I just don't have as much as confidence as you do in Chris Chibnall's writing. I honestly just think Chris Chibnall's idea of 'The Doctor' is to be a really nice and completely innocent person and that's why so many villains don't get completely defeated, can't have a really nice person killing people. 

Unfortunately, a lot of the times, he completely fumbles it when you have the Doctor basically saying ""Killing is bad, sticking them in a container to rot for an eternity is the answer!"" (from Series 11 finale) or ""Killing is bad, letting something slowly die from agonizing pain is much better!"" (from Arachnids in the UK).

 If you do a Donald Trump parody, and the Donald Trump character comes out as more morally right over the Doctor, you've spectacularly fumbled something. If it were deliberate, one of the companions should've said 'You've fucked this up big time Doc' or 'How dare you let him just saunter off like that'"
Unit 42,"If you have to explain in a very long post why isn't the series a pile of shit, than the series is probably a pile of shit."
Unit 42, Chinball created a pile of shit.

>I recently discovered that when he brought the Silurians back he originally wanted to reveal that they had always looked his new redesign and that in all their previous appearances they had just been wearing costumes.

Recently? Did you not watch The Hungry Earth where 11 takes off Elia's MASK. Like that's a direct allusion to that and one I remember hearing and allways liking. It's the equivalent of war paint or 6's coat. 

Rory: The¬†Doctor's¬†idea. 
River: Of course. His rules of engagement:¬†float like a butterfly, sting¬†like¬†a bee. 
Rory:Look ridiculous.
River: Have you tried heels?

And as for the Time Lord takedown, I did say that my 5th piece is allways missing. I just know The Master and the Doctor are both Ux and that the theme of the story is responsibility. That little bit in between is why I'm not Chris Chibnall. 

I was reading something a while ago about how [Chibnall fucked up producing Camelot long ago and learned failure creates better than success.](https://rts.org.uk/article/chris-chibnall-man-who-reinvented-cliffhanger)

>""Very early in my career,‚Äù says Chibnall, ‚Äúsomeone told me that you learn more from a failure than you do from a success. And then I lived out that phrase for a year in Los Angeles. I learned that I would not work that way again or be put in that situation again.‚Äù The essential lesson was: ‚ÄúYou either have to be in total control of a show or working with people who share your vision and will work with you to achieve it. Also, never work with 13¬†executive producers.

‚ÄúCamelot was the classic case of too many cooks. It wasn‚Äôt a harmonious set-up and I think that does manifest itself on screen.

‚ÄúI had a fantastic cast but you have to be free to tell the story you want to tell in the way that you want to tell it. What ended up on screen was not what I wanted and so it is a blemish on my CV.‚Äù"

Unit 42,">Recently? Did you not watch The Hungry Earth where 11 takes off Elia's MASK. Like that's a direct allusion to that and one I remember hearing and allways liking. It's the equivalent of war paint or 6's coat. 

Never knew that was the source of it. Thought it was just a way of trying to say ""look their not really monsters, they look more like you"" (which is pretty much my big problem with the redesign, they look to human. All the surprise of discovering the seven foot lizard thing with three eyes is actually an intelligent, soulful race doesn't exist anymore).

Look you want to advocate for them wearing masks into battle, sure go for it you want to associate them with ancient war societies. But the idea they spent all their time in all their previous appearances wearing large impractical costumes that look nothing like they really are, even when alone with each other...no that just leaves to many questions for me to swallow.

>And as for the Time Lord takedown, I did say that my 5th piece is allways missing. I just know The Master and the Doctor are both Ux and that the theme of the story is responsibility. That little bit in between is why I'm not Chris Chibnall.

But yeah your right, their is always hope."

That change is the fun part. Embracing the differences to understand them.

On the other hand it has a history of ditching ideas that went down poorly."

**Aunt Wu** (the fortuneteller) = maybe similar to [Kate Bush eg Running Up That Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp43OdtAAkM) 

But I became very unsure about the pattern!)

***

I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a band focuses on.
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each band tells you something about some layer of the situation.
 
You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns in a single global ""spectrum"":

- *Scooter < I Like Trains < Assemblage 23 < Ashbury Heights < Elvis Presley* **(in the middle)** < *Coldplay and google-translated Kukryniksy & Kurt Vile < Electric Six*

- *< AWOLNATION and The Rolling Stones and Florence + The Machine and LMFAO < google-translated Mujuice and Aria and and google-translated Piknik and Queen and Hurts*

- *< John Lennon < P!nk and Phil Collins and Monoral and Eurythmics and Bondage Fairies and google-translated Nautilus Pompilius and Philip Kirkorov and Kate Bush < google-translated 7B < ""Weird Al"" Yankovic*

The farther you go, the more a band focuses on a single fact... or the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets.

That's just my intuition! (And I don't know how to order some and where to put some)

***

Another version of ""Post Scriptum"": (I apologize for bothering you)
 
All people for me are like heroes (or brilliant characters/ cool people!), no less. I know this is very improbable that I will be able to help anybody with this ""pattern language"", but there's a chance no matter how small and miniscule and absurd sounding **(and it's better than nothing, better than to do nothing at all)**
 
Maybe you can test this theory about speaking patterns with modern day technology such as [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)#Applications) or [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#GPT-3)"
Unit 42,"I believe you can apply those patterns to music bands, and the fun part is that you can apply the pattern to any piece of any song of the band (it's like a fractal: every piece looks alike)

Bonus with *inane* music band analogies ->

I will quote

(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...

(.) is a bunch of standalone facts/events that don't need any context to be understood, every bit of (.)-speech is a self-sustained point... you can split such speech into pieces without losing any context...

- *I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went* (-)(>) *So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)* (-)(>) *I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight*

Unit 42,I'm liking it but it doesn't feel like a CW Show

Unit 42,"Everything about this show feels as it‚Äôs going to be a flop. From the terrible reviews, to the several other new military dramas being aired this season, to the concept not really fitting the CW‚Äôs demographics."
Unit 42,That trailer was... boring. 
Unit 42,I thought it was was interesting enough to watch again next week.
Unit 42,"Wanted to like it because Ochoa, but then the first trailer dropped and it was pure garbage... but you know what? The first ep was actually quite decent."
Unit 42,"All the new military shows are flops.  The Brave is a less interesting version of Taken, which is borderline to start with.   Seal Team was so generic that David Boreanz couldn't save it - turned it off mid-episode.    Valor crossed a military show with CW drama.

I hope they all get cancelled."
Unit 42,Christina Ochoa is the only reason I am going to be watching and loving this show.

Unit 42,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_patriotism
Unit 42,World War III.
Unit 42,Hollywood first saw the huge success of American Sniper and that caught their eye. From there they started seeing all the fly over states/red-states making their voices heard about old school American values and supporting the troops so they started pumping out special forces series.

It took a huge tonal shift when it moved to Cinemax and became a US show after just one season and basically turned it into an all new show, but yet they managed to make it equally good in a different way!

Unit 42,Sharon stone sucks and the guy from longmire he's horrible for this job it needs work why do all tough girls have to be beautiful? all the tough girls i know aren't that good looking
Unit 42,42/100 seems entirely too charitable imo.

He can shoot but the bad guys with automatic rifles can't hit him or her spraying down a narrow corridor? REALLY??? And when I say narrow, I mean barely larger then shoulder width.      
I will probably continue to watch it for the sexy chick factor. I will not watch it expecting to see anything great though.     
One thing I did find interesting was it seemed to be a twist on the Destroyer series of books. Except there was no martial arts to speak of, the Vice president knows about it and obviously others.

I kinda liked the Agent X guy, and the show in general felt a lot like the Player on NBC, which has much better production value, but wont be sticking around.

Trinkets,I feel like after this airs we're going to see some shoplifting statistics similar to the suicide statistics after 13 Reasons Why premiered.
Trinkets,This looks SO GOOD. I may be in the minority but I love these edgy Netflix teen dramas. This looks like a lot of fun.
Trinkets,r/TrinketsNetflix for those who are interested
Trinkets,I have an urge to klepto something now.
Trinkets,Looks like it has a similar tone to *Good Girls*.
Trinkets,"Not gonna lie, it makes shoplifting look cool and makes me think about it. Not gonna act on it, but I know people with less control than me will definitely act on it."
Trinkets,I love them too. Like yea I‚Äôm only 20 so I‚Äôm not too far removed from high school. But teen dramas have some of the best shows and movies.
Trinkets,That would be nobody
Trinkets,"Really enjoy this show. I put it on one night as my fall asleep show, intending to watch maybe 20 minutes, ended up binging the whole thing. Worth it."
Trinkets,Hell Yeah also cant wait for the second season of Sex Education. Netflix really has some good young adult shit tbh and 13 Reasons Why is not what I mean.
Trinkets,"I watched the whole first season, and I'm pretty sure I liked it, but now I don't remember a single thing that happened...I rarely forget shows that fast."
Trinkets,Girl in thumbnail looks a lot like Bruno Mars wearing a wig.
Trinkets,"I had forgotten this drops today. Season 1 definitely had its issues but overall, it had its charm and was an enjoyable watch. Glad that it gets its second and final season to wrap this up."
Trinkets,"Simon Pegg's my favorite cameo.

""Remember, selling books is a game. And like any game, it has rules. And you need to learn the rules and get serious about them, because this *isn't a game*."""
Trinkets,"It's really good, Dylan Moran is really really great at playing Exasperated Smart Guy."
Trinkets,‚ÄúYou know what you are? You‚Äôre a beard with an idiot attached to it.‚Äù  Best insult ever. 
Trinkets,Whores will have their trinkets.
Trinkets,"""Millwall, Millwall, you're so dreadful, and all your girlfriends are unfulfilled and alienated!"""
Trinkets,"What is your mother‚Äôs maiden name?
‚ÄúHer maiden name?! I don‚Äôt even know her first name! I just knew her as Ma! That‚Äôll have to do‚Äù "
Trinkets,Love Black Books.  Dylan Moran and Bill Bailey have some great stand up shows as well.  Check out Green Wing for more surreal UK comedy.
Trinkets,I would watch it but right now I'm busy eating scrambled eggs from a shoe with a Combe.
Trinkets,The frozen wine bottle popsicle always makes me giggle when I see it!
Trinkets,"The episode where Bernard gets locked out is one of my favourites.

‚ÄúWelcome to.. the thing.. whatever this place is‚Äù"
Trinkets,Omid dhjali as Mannys pimp is my personal fav!
Trinkets,Nick the Accountant. Nick the Accountant. IS A FUGITIVE!
Trinkets,Half ten!? I've never been awake at half ten what happens?
Trinkets,[deleted]
Trinkets,Dylan Moran working briefly in the fast food restaurant is one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV.
Trinkets,"I thought it was mostly fantastic. I think my favorite episode was the one with the children's book. Sometimes I like to think that Bernard is a crazy old Time Lord who retired on Earth and stopped giving fucks long ago. It would explain how relatively durable he is, how the shop stays open, and how he could type a 1000+ page Russian epic in a night or two."
Trinkets,[deleted]
Trinkets,"One of my favourite moments (and I know describing visual comedy is an arrestable offense) is when Manny is lamenting to Bernard how bereft of customers the shop is when a fly buzzes in through the open front door, buzzes around the empty shop (portrayed with mild camera work and sfx) before buzzing back out the front door.  And it closes the door behind itself.

Such a weird show."
Trinkets,"This is for sure a Top 5 favorite show for me. Dylan Moran as Bernard has to be among the funniest, most relatably curmudgeon of all time. If you ever wondered what Spongebob would be like if it was from Squidward‚Äôs perspective, this is it."
Trinkets,"'There's the elephant'

'He's happy with his balloon'

'Oh no! It's gone...'"
Trinkets,I love the part where he finds a mushroom in his hair and eats it
Trinkets,"It's some sort of delicious biscuit 

...it's a coaster...

WHAT?!  Is there any more?!"
Trinkets,That wine episode is the best!
Trinkets,The little book of calm had me hooked from the get go! Fav episode be them going off on holiday! Very good writing. I highly recommend seeing Dylan Moran's stand-up comedy if you lile Black Books. 
Trinkets,"It's one of those shows that I didn't really feel at first, but I stuck with it and after a few episodes I got used to it and grew to love it. It's just so comforting and charming."
Trinkets,...... Dave‚Äôs Syndrome 
Trinkets,"I loved it.  Its quite offbeat in a really hilarious way.  Time to watch it again methinks, its been awhile.  I agree the cameos were the icing on the cake.  I think my favorite episode is the piano one, Bailey gave me huge belly laughs.  "
Trinkets,"The episode where Manny and Bernard make wine for the pope is solid gold tele-visual magic in my book. I love two things, everybody and television, and 'Black Books' is some of the best television I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. "
Trinkets,I recreated the ‚ÄúOn Phone‚Äù post-it gag with a customer once. It didn‚Äôt go down as well. 
Trinkets,"""She's playing with fire.  He's not ready for Nibbly Pig!"" "
Trinkets,"As a sufferer of Dave's Syndrome, I found it to be very sensitively handled."
Trinkets,"That was the first British show that I watched that was deeply British.  Meaning, I understood the words, but damned if I didn't get confused by the references. I had seen Spaced and was hungry for more. It was a good fit though and started me down the rabbit hole of awesome TV."
Trinkets,"Is space hot?

Of course it is, where do you think we get pineapples?

Second time today I got to use that. "
Trinkets,Favorite episode is when he is locked out and gets a job serving fast food so he doesn't have to be out in the rain 
Trinkets,"When you‚Äôre feeling under pressure, do something different. Roll up your sleeves, or eat an orange."
Trinkets,My absolute favourite tv show! Every single line is a classic. Does make me want to chain smoke though ü§î
Trinkets," Absolutely loved Black Books. Kevin Eldon cameo as The Cleaner was amazing (check out his imdb by the way, including his first film which will surprise you.  Lol I sound like fucking clickbait).

Check out Friday Night Dinner, if you haven't seen it already!"
Trinkets,"*Reads that you can get an extension on tax return due to injury*

Outside to a group of thugs ""Which one of you bitcheesssss, wants to dance?"""
Trinkets,[deleted]
Trinkets,I once annoyed Dylan Moran in the Carwash pub in Edinburgh. It was <exactly> like meeting Bernard Black.
Trinkets,"One of my favourite scenes is when Bill Bailey gets locked inside the shop, gets drunk on a shot‚Äôs worth of absinthe and roasts a bumble bee for food. 

Laughed for days when I first saw that. "
Trinkets,Simon Pegg as Manny's boss at the rival bookshop made me appreciate Simon Pegg for the first time
Trinkets,He was sat there...sucking his trousers...and LAUGHING!
Trinkets,One of my favorite shows of all time 
Trinkets,"Fantastic series.

""We'll make some more! Mix in some of the cheap stuff, he'll never know the difference.""

""But he's the Pope. He's used to the finer things."""
Trinkets,"The episode where they created a new bottle of wine from an old expensive one had me in stitches. 
"
Trinkets,"I identify so thoroughly with the line ""I've never been up at half-ten! What happens?"""
Trinkets,"Dylan's stand up is great too, was lucky to see him in Clevend a couple of years ago."
Trinkets,"Love the living hell out of that show. Tried it on a whim. Unfortunately Netflix dropped it before I saw the last episode or two. 
Totally fell for Tamsin Greig. Funny and sexy. Wow!"
Trinkets,"The one where Manny discovers he can play the piano.

Did not realise Bill Bailey was such a good muso."
Trinkets,"One of my favorite Peter Serafinowicz minor roles. Fran loves his character's voice, but thinks he's a jerk, so she's going to listen to him on the radio and have some ""alone time.""

He stops ""prematurely,"" so she calls him and he assumes something's wrong.

""I'll come over, Fran. Fran! I'm coming, Fran! I'm coming!""

Fran: <ORGASMIC SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK>"
Trinkets,"""You really believed that Apes could have meetings."" "
Trinkets,Love. It. Dylan did an AMA the other week!
Trinkets,Bernard attempting to complete his tax return always has me in hysterics!
Trinkets,"I saw Bill Bailey live on Thursday and he said people all over the world still point at him, make cone shapes over their chest with their hands and chant ‚ÄòBernard Bernard Bernard‚Äô at him
"
Trinkets,"I love British comedies, thanks for the recommendation. 

There's a great one on Netflix that unfortunately didn't get renewed for a season 2: ""Crazy Head"". It's not your typical dry British comedy though. 

I used to watch Vicar of Dibley, Father Ted, Drop the Dead Donkey, 'Allo 'Allo, Fawlty Towers and Absolutely Fabulous"
Trinkets,"Oh HELL yes! 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat are you eating?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs some sort of delicious biscuit.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a coaster.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs it? Are there any more?‚Äù"
Trinkets,"I feel strangely that Black Books is kinda a precursor possible influence for Always Sunny. Horrible people and their hijinx. Well not Manny, he's a saint."
Trinkets,I ATE ALL YOUR BEES!
Trinkets,Omg meeeee!! I love Black Books
Trinkets,"'Pardon me, boys, is this the Chattanooga Choo Choo?"""
Trinkets,Ok now I'm just going through this thread and upvoting literally every quote from the show. 
Trinkets,One of the most british comedies I'm aware of. Dylan gets points just for the pure amount of cigarettes smoked.
Trinkets,"1. No Walkmans.

2. None of that.

3. Or any of the rest of it. "
Trinkets,I adore it. 
Trinkets,Fuck yeah there's love for it
Trinkets,Knew next to nothing about it before I checked it out on Netflix. Had me chuckling like an idiot with every episode.
Trinkets,Comedy gold. Up there with Alan Partridge and the Fast Show.
Trinkets,"Add a dab of lavender to your milk, leave town with an orange, and pretend you're laughing at it."
Trinkets,"She'll have summery friends who know how to be outside. She'll play tennis and wear dresses and have bare feet, and in the autumn, I'll ditch her, cause she's my summer girl!"
Trinkets,WE SAID WE WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT CANADA!
Trinkets,"And a ham sandwich?
With a PICKLE?!
*Ecstasy face*"
Trinkets,"If u like black books check out - father ted, the IT crowd and green wing. Oh and ducking SPACED !!! I fucking love spaced. That's what I'm doing this weekend... spaced and a big feed of spliffs"
Trinkets,Watched it sometime last year on Netflix definitely need to rewatch I loved that show 
Trinkets, I love it. It ended too soon. They can easily keep going but don't know why they just made three season.
Trinkets,"'Moone Boy' is great as well.
"
Trinkets,"OMG yes!  
Lots of love for it and Mr. Moran

One of my best 2017 moments was seeing him live with the ""Grumbling Mustard"""
Trinkets,Im pissed that that show only lasted for two seasons. 
Trinkets,"Where can I watch this now? Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime? "
Trinkets,i'm surprised there's not a shitty watered-down americanised version of this yet
Trinkets,"Every time a girlfriend talks to me about having her folks over I reply, ""I refuse to have my house infested with specimens capable of producing YOU.""

The one who gets the joke will be my soulmate. Its a foolproof system."
Trinkets,That show is hilarious! I became a Dylan fan after. I saw him live not too long ago. He was drunk and angry and disheveled and it was perfect.
Trinkets,Right!! Which one of you bitches wants to dance?
Yankee,"Holy crap, don‚Äôt just throw a pic of Norm Abrams up on my feed like that. I thought he died. Awesome about the the shows on YouTube though‚Ä¶ thanks!"
Yankee,"I used to watch this guy every Saturday morning on PBS.  It was fascinating.  He would say ""I was out a garage sale the other day and saw this really nice cabinet.  So im gonna make it."" and about 45min later he had a cabinet that could easily sold for a few grand."
Yankee,"Remember this, there is no more important safety rule than to wear these: safety glasses!"
Yankee,Good stuff  thanks.
Yankee,Norm Abrams is an American treasure.
Yankee,I always loved how the humble workshop held like $1m worth of tools.
Yankee,I carried a 1st generation Tivo loaded with nothing but New Yankee episodes saved on it for years and years. Loved that show.
Yankee,Norm!
Yankee,"Norm rules. I loved this show when I was young. It's funny, I had a collection of porn magazines but was more embarrassed that I had a bunch of interior design and furniture building magazines."
Yankee,This will make my dad very happy
Yankee,NORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yankee,"Seriously. Just two weeks ago, I discovered Townsends on YouTube and it feels like the yankee workshop, but in the kitchen (it‚Äôs different, but hits the same for me). That led me to looking up norm, and much to my surprise he‚Äôs not dead."
Yankee,There's a 24/7 *This Old House* channel on Pluto TV if you need your fix.
Yankee,"I read an interview about him once. Guy watched him work. He really is as good as they show. Most of that was one take. He'd think about it, measure, draw, and then cut."
Yankee,Honestly a great idea. I wish I had the whole series on DVD.
Yankee,It‚Äôs been my binge this past few weeks. I have noticed a lot of repeat though.
Yankee,"Yea my wife and I were crushing through it, but it seems to be the same 6-8 houses."
Yankee,"Confirmed. Once it gets to the hurricane Katrina episodes I'm out. There's a ton of community work, which I can appreciate, but there's far less focus on the process and tools, which is the only reason I watch."
Yankee,The Wonderful World of Disney!
Yankee,"I know this is less of a post and more of an add but, dammit, I would love to get another season. The third one was the weakest. It wasn't the same without Harry Treadaway. So, I want another season as a second chance. Gleeson was so good in this series."
Yankee,Literally just watched this on Netflix. Great first season! Second was good but started to wane and third it just seemed lost.
Yankee,"Holly Gibney portrayal in this show was spot on, way better than Outsider"
Yankee,I loved this show. The whole cast was great and Brendan Gleason was brilliant as Bill Hodges
Yankee,Great show that got totally fucked over by a bizarre distribution gimmick from AT&T and DirectTV
Yankee,"Season 1+2 were good/decent , 3 got a bit out there: crazy"
Yankee,Ok...but its already on Netflix. I just finished watching the final episode.
Yankee,What a strangely violent show to put on Disney.
Yankee,"Oh dammit, does that mean they're taking it off SBS?"
Yankee,"It was based off a trilogy of Stephen King books though. And if I remember right, they swapped the second and third book around for the tv series, too.

I never actually finished this show, need to pick it up again."
Yankee,"I didn‚Äôt watch season 3. So they just >!showed Brady getting his powers in season 2, then adapted the book about the book thief/killer?!<."
Yankee,The entire cast was phenomenal.
Yankee,"It was called The Audience Network and it was just never going to work.  What the hell were they thinking over there?  Kingdom was another great show they had; IMO, it had the potential to be absolutely huge had it aired literally anywhere else.  It couldn't get any traction because 90% of people couldn't watch it.

The only good thing about Audience Network was that they saved Damages after FX cancelled it.  It was a mixed blessing though.  The last two seasons weren't as strong and the budget got cut to shit, it looked so cheap compared to how it looked when FX aired it."
Yankee,"It's on both Netflix and Prime Video in Australia as per JustWatch. And it's not streaming in New Zealand anywhere. 

So it's either getting removed from Netflix and Prime Video or Aussies are going to get a third option to watch it."
Yankee,There's a lot of crazier shit on Disney+ outside the US. They've got straight up horror movies on it. And shows full of nudity. Pam & Tommy was released as an Original series on Disney+ in most countries outside of the US and Latin America and that show had a 'talking penis' scene.
Yankee,That Puritanism runs deep yankee.
Yankee,Disney plus is combined with Hulu in some countries outside the us
Yankee,Pretty much. With the repercussions of Season 2 being explored in Season 3.
Yankee,[Serious] can I get that content using a VPN if I have a profile on my brother‚Äôs account? Or is it tied to the subscriber‚Äôs IP address or something?
Yankee,In every country actually. It's just the US and Latin America which are exceptions as Disney owns separate streaming services for mature content in both these regions.
Yankee,"You can access all that content if you have a good VPN. I use Nord VPN but it's a paid one. I'd suggest you give Windscribe VPN a try, that's a good free one."
Yankee,‚ÄúWhy would anybody do drugs when they can just mow a lawn?‚Äù
Yankee,"""Don't you understand? You're not making Christianity any better; you're just making rock and roll worse. """
Yankee,"My favorite episode is the one when Hank and Peggy unkowingly take in a prostitute.
At the end, her pimp ""Alabaster Jones"" voiced by Snoop comes from Oklahoma City to retrieve her.

As Hank prepares to barter with him, the young lady cautions Hank to be careful because he's tough.

Hank dismisses the potential danger by saying, ""Yeah, but he's from Oklahoma.""

As a native Texan, this was especially funny"
Yankee,"Yeah I think it really shows the creator's love for this part of Texas and the life there.  This show could be insanely funny but then hit you with a gut punch of emotion.

Bobby Hill casually saying ""yo, Sharice, you stone cold fox, what up?"" Always made me laugh but also showed the self esteem and confidence this fat oval of a character had.  This show is easily one of the best sitcoms of all time."
Yankee,I DON‚ÄôT KNOW YOU!! THAT‚ÄôS MY PURSE!!
Yankee,"Hehe this is really cute. The best way to describe KotH is as a friendly caricature of real-life central Texas. But overall, you are far from the only one to love it. It's definitely a classic, and I hear there are talks about making another series? It will be an instant hit, I tell you hwat."
Yankee,King of the Hill is Texas‚Äô greatest gift to the world. 25 years later and it‚Äôs still just as good.
Yankee,"A classic of Americana in my eyes. Even for this child of Michigan, the familiar feel of family life with all its love and frustration was perfect. My dad was very Hank, I describe him as such to this day, and I realize how Bobby I was whether I like to admit it or not."
Yankee,"I have lived in North Texas all my life and most people I know feel like the show is a very accurate, if slightly absurd, depiction of Texas culture.  

I can‚Äôt wait for the new episodes."
Yankee,"Dale, I'm a better friend than a psychopath like you has a right to.

Is one of my favorite Hank Hill lines."
Yankee,">I‚Äôm in constant pain, but by god I got me a 53 thousand dollar settlement. 

https://youtu.be/IcLbHUBoDpI"
Yankee,The milks about to go.... And there it goes...
Yankee,"""Here's a little trick I use to remember my name. Ok, I think of a man name Lu and then a woman named Anne. They meet in a kingdom in the forest.""

 She is so precious. RIP Brittany Murphy!"
Yankee,"My favorite episode is the one where they go to Louisiana so Hank can try to win a million dollars at the Sugar Bowl. Bobby starts dressing and speaking as a dandy, and poor Bill finally has something good happen to him. Three times!"
Yankee,I love that show. As someone who lives in Texas it's basically a documentary. You will also be happy to know it's getting a revival.
Yankee,"I LOVE Peggy's confidence. About her intelligence, about her Spanish, about her good looks- she is so confident! I remember that when I feel down about myself haha"
Yankee,"Luanne is my favorite too! :) She's got some amazing moments throughout the entire series. I love the episode where she moves out of the Hill home to another spot on the street - at the end, there's a wonderful, totally wholesome scene between her and Hank. It's the first time he really understands that she can take care of herself, and it's easy to see that he respects the hell out of her for it. They even share a beer by the pool she proudly has been maintaining, just like Hank and his lawn. ""You taught me how to fish.""

Edit: wording"
Yankee,A firefighting we will go is one of the greatest episodes
Yankee,"My favorite moment is when Connie throws shade at my school to horrify her parents  

 ""I wanna go to a party school - Chico State, yeaaahhh!"" 

it was unexpected and amazing"
Yankee,"‚Ä¢ **Obviously the voice acting is top tier & my favourite character is Luanne.**

Sadly, both she and her husband Lucky won‚Äôt be reprised, due to both voice actors passing away (Brittany Murphy and Tom Petty). If ‚ÄòKotH‚Äô is to be rebooted, perhaps these two characters can be referenced 3rd-person by Hank, Peggy or Bobby but there‚Äôd be no direct interaction with Luanne or Lucky anymore."
Yankee,"""To tell you the truth dad, that sounds boring. It's ok if you're into boring but I'm not""

Bobby Hill is underappreciated."
Yankee,"I'm born and raised in the DFW area and I know at least 1 of just about every single character in the show. Obviously it's exaggerated in some spots, but by and large it's a very accurate depiction of a small/mid sized Texas town. Such a great show.

Mt favorite character is easily Boggle Champion Peggy Hill"
Yankee,"Luanne is the understated main character of the show.  Every other character is who they are, the show ends with them in the same place they started.

Luanne had real character growth.  She was living in Hank's den, then she went to school, got a job, started her own business, moved out on her own, got married, had a baby.  she grew up and matured, but never lost her kind and loveable nature.  

Hank was the moral compass of the show, Luanne was the heart.

the upcoming reboot won't be the same without her."
Yankee,Hey this post came at an interesting time for me because I just started season 1 as a first time viewer! I've seen 9 episodes and so far have really enjoyed it in the ways that you have.
Yankee,"Somewhat incidental, but it was [a review of King of the Hill](https://www.macleans.ca/uncategorized/king-of-the-hill-revisited-peggy-the-boggle-champ-and-keeping-up-with-our-joneses/) that best summed up for me why episodic television can be just as moving as serialized:

> This is why emotional involvement in non-arc episodes can be so intense, and why, in a strange way, it‚Äôs not the arcs that really lend depth to a show. Characters who change constantly and spectacularly ‚Äî you know, going from meek little schoolgirl to supervillain and back ‚Äî don‚Äôt change the way real people do. In real life, we learn things about people we didn‚Äôt know before, and that adds to the way we see them. What King of the Hill is trying to do is what The Simpsons did in its early years, and what many great comedies do: create characters who rarely change but have consistent character histories that the writers and the audience can draw on. [...] The more we know about the characters, the more interesting their stories are."
Yankee,"My favorite episode (well, one of many) is when hank gets hooked on an mmorpg called ‚Äúpro-pain‚Äù after he was forced to play test it."
Yankee,"Fun fact: There is a big argument in the Japanese King of the Hill fan community about which is better, sub or dub.

Not even joking. Turns out a lot of them complain that the dubs don't get Boomhauer's mumbling right."
Yankee,"_But dad, what if they ask for anything other than medium-rare?_


_Then we politely, but firmly, ask them to leave_"
Yankee,You should watch Malcolm in the Middle too. It's not exactly the same vibe but I find the two very similar in the way the portrayed the typical American suburban working class families.
Yankee,"I'm not even American but I find Koth strangely relatable, the characters are all very realistic and somehow I know people in my life who are very much alike them.

The show is right amount of silly yet remains very down to earth."
Yankee,I grew up in the part of Texas that it is loosely based on and i can tell you that it‚Äôs remarkably accurate
Yankee,I'm so happy its coming back üòÅ
Yankee,Lol i know the scene you're talking about. It goes right through that barn door üòÜ ü§£ üòÇ
Yankee,Show does an excellent job of capturing normal life in the USA.
Yankee,propane and propane accessories I'll tell you whut..
Yankee,"Some of my favorites are those featuring Bill's extended family, particularly his cousin Gilbert. The episode they go to Bill's family plantation and Bobby starts acting like a Southern dandy might be my favorite. (A Beer Can Named Desire)"
Yankee,"awesome but oft overlooked scene: Dooley threatening Bobby in front of Peggy(who was substituting for the Spanish teacher) and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dead‚Äù. Then Peggy, instead of addressing or even acknowledging the threat, instead tells him he should be speaking Spanish, so Dooley just repeats the threat en Espa√±ol. The whole situation is funny enough, but Dooley‚Äôs sullen monotone voice somehow really raises that scene to a whole other level"
Yankee,It taste likes turtles
Yankee,"The pay off with the egg joke at the end of that episode is easily one of the funniest bits imo as well haha. When I was younger, they used to air KotH from 8 to 9pm on cartoon network and I'd always turn it on and watch it til I fell asleep. I loved how they played the series in ordered. Ended up watching the whole series like 2.5 times through I think. Still great to watch!"
Yankee,"If you like King of the Hill, check out its Canadian cousin Corner Gas (no affiliation other than a shared vibe)"
Yankee,"When it was on in America, a lot of people called it the ""most realistic show on television,"" which was odd for an animated series. I miss it and hope the reboot really happens. 

RIP Lucky and Luanne."
Yankee,"I'm from Texas, and I can confirm that there are people who talk like Boomhauer.  I don't have any trouble understanding him.  He's exaggerated, sure, but no, that's a real thing."
Yankee,"my ex was super left wing and hated it/had a complete lack of interest. to me i felt like you did, OP, despite being radically progressive myself. it makes me wonder about the role of art in distinguishing our tastes from our beliefs"
Yankee,"it's the perfect balance of poking fun at stereotypes but not ""punching down"". it never feels like a pretentious ""look at these dopes"", it's awfully charming and wholesome but still pokes fun at (southern) american stereotypes. can't wait for the revival."
Yankee,Watching it right now. Mostly wholesome so the off-color parts are really funny when they happen. It‚Äôs like Fred Flintstone meets Andy Griffith.
Yankee,"‚ÄúHair and makeups‚Äù aw, bless your lil‚Äô heart, girl!"
Yankee,"me(getting out of shower and the cat is sitting there in the bathroom): ‚ÄúAUNT PEGGY!! THE CAT SAW ME NAKED!!!‚Äù

my wife(just trying to watch tv out in the living room): ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äôs goin on in there?!‚Äù"
Yankee,"Glad you found the show! It‚Äôs a classic. 

I have a friend that we call ‚ÄúBoomy‚Äù because he speaks like Boomhauer, the nickname is so entrenched now that I doubt any friends made in the last 15 years know what his real name is."
Yankee,"Yep. 

Yep. 

Yep.

Mmhmm."
Yankee,"Sometimes when I'm sick I look for the 24/7 vaughnlive stream of KoTH, stream it to the TV through chromecast and just doze off with it as background noise, I don't mean it's bad, I mean it's theraupeutic, like watching TV as a kid on the living room at night kind of thing."
Yankee, /r/KingOfTheHill
Yankee,i love KoTH too. it‚Äôs been my favor adult cartoon since i was a kid
Yankee,i cried laughing at that egg joke. absolutely perfect
Yankee,Closest thing to slice of life anime America's ever made.
Yankee,"""Mom, Dad, I've gotten Luanne pregnant!"""
Yankee,North Texas? More like south Oklahoma.
Yankee,"The tornado episode is also my favorite OP. I quote it weekly , two barn doors if one of them is open !"
Yankee,"Donald Ferguson in Amazons ""Invincible"" is a nod to Bobby hill. 

Bobby was reading the debut issue of ""unvincible"" (same cover as Invincible) in the 2008 episode ""Behind closed doors""."
Yankee,"The biggest mind blow I've ever had watching this was when I realized that Boomhauer doesn't seem to reeeeeeaally care that much about all the other characters. He's just some dude with a decent social status, living his celibate life and occasionally drinks beers with his old kind of weird neighbors lol!

And of my favorite moments goes like this:
""Mister Hill are to gay??""
""Bwaaahhhaaahaa no I sell propane!"""
Yankee,Finding myself turning into Hank Hill has been weird.
Leila,"Is this show coming out in 2023? I assume so. Maybe the spring to get it out before the Emmy deadline. The cast is great, and it‚Äôs Cuar√≥n so I‚Äôm excited."
Leila,"Nice it looks good. I have been enjoying their Indian series more lately. Hope they keep up with the quality‚Äôs. 

So far I enjoyed  from  Netflix 

Sacred games

Ghoul

Selection day 

Delhi crime

The Indian detective"
Leila,Is it just me or the show is too dark? I could barely make out the faces in the trailer.
Leila,Pretty sure the final scene of the trailer is a huge spoiler.
Leila,Imao Netflix going hard for the r/india audience probably knows they are the only ones in india who can afford their expensive service.
Leila,Did you see Made in Heaven? Definitely my favourite from amazon India and probably on par with sacred games in quality.
Leila,"I had no problems, way brighter than GOTs long night"
Leila,"Not having read the books i'll probably forget about that scene when i get sucked into it and binging in one go. Trailer looks pretty dope, really hope it doesn't suck"
Leila,[removed]
Leila,"Is that on prime if so I haven‚Äôt seen it yet. 

The one I saw on prime is 

Mirzapur 

Breath"
Leila,I think OP is referring to the 'anti-Hindu' beliefs being spread by this show.
Leila,Yeah it's on prime and way better than both of them
Leila,which movie ?
Leila,Jesus this comment chain is annoying as shit
Leila,I meant this show
Leila,Ah okay.
Leila,"wow, this is so cool - i love her films!"
Leila,If you want to show a literal Indian dystopia just go film around Mumbai.
Leila,I will gladly follow Reservation Dogs wherever it decides to go. This show never does the same thing twice. It‚Äôs incredibly exciting.
Leila,This is such an amazing show. I would say the best way to describe is it‚Äôs like the first 2 seasons of Atlanta.
Leila,"Honorable Mentions:

* Lindsay Wagner (""Blood & Treasure"")
* Leila George (""Animal Kingdom"")"
Leila,I thought the kids crushed it too.
Leila,"What are some shows you would compare it to?

I thought of giving it a shot but from what I remember from the trailer it was about some teenagers. Is it like those CW shows or is it something more?"
Leila,"Nothing like those CW shows. It‚Äôs way more ‚Äúcoming of age‚Äù and less ‚Äúteen drama‚Äù - season two is leaning way heavier into the ‚Äòsupporting your small community aspect‚Äô which is refreshing. I love it because it showcases stories from a marginalized community (and they do to so well) but even if you don‚Äôt care about that it‚Äôs just incredibly funny, quickly paced and enjoyable watch."
Leila,"It‚Äôs nothing like CW shows. The kids on this show are far more realistic, there‚Äôs no romance storylines, no teen drama, none of those cliches or tropes. We only see them in school once as well. 

Also it was heavily marketed to focus on the four kids. And at least one of them is in every episode. But there is a big focus on the adults as well. 

The easiest comparison to make is towards Atlanta, with four main characters, mystical elements, different stories each week. Less plot heavy. 

The show is totally worth watching, hilarious, incredibly unique, heartbreakingly emotional at times. The cast is amazing, D‚ÄôPharaoh Woon-A-Tai and Devery Jacobs are stars, and the Reservation feels so lived in and real."
Leila,Def something more
Leila,"Some of the teens are really annoying, especially this season, but the adults and the uniqueness of the show make it worth the watch. This episode has been my favorite so far; it focused solely on on the mothers and aunties of the show and their internal lives. It was also fun and hilarious."
Leila,Disney keeps hiring these hack writers and directors for everything. Mando is good bc of filoni and what's his head
Leila,"The wrong writer, director, composer, etc. But also all of their work was compromised by the rushed production schedule. They did not have enough time to make this good. Disney was not willing to wait because they wanted content for Disney Plus."
Leila,"It was intended to be a movie, but Solo flopped, so with the success of Clone Wars, Mando, they decided to try a show, and that seems to have been it‚Äôs downfall. They appear to have fleshed out the original movie script. There‚Äôs a cut online called the Patterson cut, which turns the show into a 2(ish) hour movie, and I watched it last night. There‚Äôs a few things they miss out that they shouldn‚Äôt have, a few things they add that they probably didn‚Äôt need to (the opening scene is clearly made in Blender). But overall, it comes across as a much faster paced, more coherent film, and this is from someone who (mostly) enjoyed Kenobi as a show."
Leila,"We all know exactly who‚Äôs at fault here Kathleen Kennedy is a plague to lucasfilm. I literally want to see George Lucas get sat down and asked ‚Äúhow do you think KK has handled Star Wars‚Äù‚Ä¶this was pretty much the first series with no Dave filoni or Jon favreau. No Dave or Jon and this is obviously the result of that. The mandalorian gets amazing reviews and they go ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get someone we barely can trust to write and direct the show of a more important character than mando‚Äù Pretty simple that not letting Jon in on ANYTHING in the studio is suicide. Why did they extend her contract after the awful sequel trilogy?, who knows! How do you push out the last Jedi and still have a Job? Lol. I‚Äôm actually enjoying watching Disney self sabotage themselves at this point it‚Äôs the only joy we‚Äôre gonna get until they at least fire Kathleen or give the rights and let Lucas arts have ACTUAL creative decisions in their content or their shares will drop immensely. They need to cleanse the entire studio and let jon and Dave take over. I prefer jon. Jon is hopefully on pace to stealing KK job because obi wan got ratioed to hell and it vanished as fast as it came. No one is talking about it. Baby yoda memes are still circulating after years and I haven‚Äôt seen a single obi wan meme other than ones that are roasting it to death. Poor ewan and Hayden they deserved better. I wish they didn‚Äôt take the gig and demanded more competence. Obi the wan is the second worst Disney Star Wars push out right behind the last Jedi."
Leila,You can only polish a turd so much! Disney has been polishing the Star Wars franchise day and night since acquisition. Why would you expect high quality and novel storytelling at this point?
Leila,They should have just done a young Leia and Reva show. That was the stories they wanted to tell and it would have worked better without Obi Wan. Imagine Bail hired Hondo and his crew to get Leia back. Would have been glorious.
Leila,"They didn't bet enough ($$$) in Obi-wan I think and yeah Solo was a factor in this regard.

They shoot themselves in the face ,not because the series flopped (it's actually bringing superb numbers overshadowing mandalorian and boba records)  but because it definitely could have work as a movie."
Leila,It's because Disney can and will continue to put shit out and most fans will gobble it up and ask for seconds. They clearly aren't even trying anymore with some of their IP. Saw the leaked Mandalorian season 3 trailer and can't believe it came from the same studio as Kenobi.
Leila,"disney just pushes content, not ideas.

as long as the content checks all the woke boxes, its good. ideas, stories, character development, logic are irrelevent.

if the content reviews poorly, just accuse the critic of being [identity]phobic.

rinse, repeat."
Leila,Made by a bunch of girls.  That's why.
Leila,"I'd say a undiagnosed anerism, possibly tumor. Or maybe your internet dropped you to 360p or something partway through the series."
Leila,And yet Deborah Chow was praised for her great Mando episodes she directed.
Leila,Why is this getting downvoted? Who is so fragile that they can't even tolerate this basic level of opinion/criticism?
Leila,"Redditors just push comments, not thought.

Just so long as they hit enough buzzwords, it's good. Sense, logic, thought, are irrelevant.

If they get push back on their comment just accuse someone of being a shill.

rinse, repeat."
Leila,"What is woke about this show? Because there is a black character?

If the existence of black people makes you think something Woke, you are simply a racist."
Leila,"I think because Star Wars fandom is politically polarized and one of the issues this hinges on is support or hatred for the Disney era of Star Wars content. I've been both hot and cold on it, depending on the project. But also some people love this show. I really wanted to."
Leila,"Curious, not that I'm personally up-voting or down-voting anything, but how can you tell when another post is down-voted when it's still above 0 up-votes?"
Leila,"You're not a shill, just part of the echo chamber"
Leila,Oh I am?
Leila,"legitimately one of the best shows Netflix has made. Cast/writing is top notch. The story is definitely interesting as well, and the way it's shot is so damn good. 

It is way better than all these coming of age dramas out there right now. 

Only issue was a couple storylines in the show seemed irrelevant, but they all fit in well for the most part. 

Really hope there's a season 2"
Leila,This show actually surprised very well written amazing cast and great story overall kudos netflix
Leila,"I'm liking it so far a lot more than I expected. 

I honestly don't think a season 2 is in the cards though, the show came out over a week ago and it's barely gotten any buzz or talk at all, much bigger Netflix shows have gotten cancelled after their first season so I don't think it's looking good for this."
Leila,"I agree Joey was literally throwing herself at them and fucking around with the dildo making everything so sexual. My only thing is I don‚Äôt know why she said Tim raped her if he just didn‚Äôt do anything because I‚Äôm her own words she literally said,‚ÄùI can do this if I want with him and whoever.‚Äù So I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs getting arrested ? & she‚Äôs annoying as fuck because after they raped her she continued to hang out with them like wtf??? I also feel like it would‚Äôve been more powerful if they used a woman of color I‚Äôm sick of seeing white feminism on tv. They also focused on her story way more than the others and I think the other storylines were way more interesting."
Leila,[removed]
Leila,"I think it‚Äôs up there with Euphoria when it comes to teen dramas, this is how a teen drama should be written. All the characters seem genuine, real and it hits on a lot of social issues teens/young adults face in the American lifestyle. It‚Äôs a bit preachy but with great intentions. Not sure it‚Äôll get renewed as I‚Äôve seen little noise but I got hooked on episode one and the storyline kept getting more interesting with each episode."
Leila,"Can you help me understand the significance of the email/ the bomb threat sent by Leila Kwan ... it felt like it was being escalated really hard with the writing of the email being the opening and closing of every episode only for it to be literally the most irrelevant thing in the entire series come the end of it.

The final scene was truly beautifully shot and the perfect closing imo... for a Netflix series top notch, but as you said a lot of irrelevant plotlines where I felt like I just wanted to skip them"
Leila,It made the top 10 list..I need a season 2 tbh üòî
Leila,"I was actually annoyed by Joey going on and on about how ‚Äúi can do this with him and whoever i want‚Äù for so long, but she‚Äôs right she can. she can do what she wants. but the very second she says ‚Äúwait im not ready‚Äù then it‚Äôs no longer consensual. I don‚Äôt care how sexual she was or how much she was ‚Äúliterally throwing herself at her them.‚Äù she withdrew consent and they continued so it‚Äôs rape."
Leila,I agree with some things u said but there is a lot of people of color activism and it‚Äôs kinda racist you think every important character have to be a person of color get over yourselves
Leila,[removed]
Leila,[removed]
Leila,"honestly Euphoria as much as I liked it was mainly aesthetic, and almost unrealistic. This show seemed much more grounded"
Leila,Yea reminded me a lot of Euphoria as well.
Leila,"I have a huge issue with most season finales especially Netflix shows. This was done extremely well. It provided a huge monumental moment for Joey, and Dom, while also keep us on the edge for what could happen with Jaysons storyline. 

That last shot brought me to tears. These actors are phenomenal."
Leila,"I think the significance of the Bomb threat in season one is to show Leila feeling like she's taking control, and to juxtapose the consequences she faces (none) against the other situations like with Owen and the wallet, or Joey's sexual assault.

Over all, I think it is something that would be explored more in season 2."
Leila,yea that was one of the storylines that was irrelevant to the plot. Her character overall was strange and wasn't used effectively at all.
Leila,I think they had to cut the show a few episodes short due to COVID19
Leila,[removed]
Leila,[removed]
Leila,"Euphoria is not unrealistic at all, growing up in FL lots of what happens in Euphoria is definitely plausible. The aesthetic was amazing but to say it was unrealistic is a stretch and a half."
Leila,"It‚Äôs a callback for S2. In the scene where Leila is coming back to school after the threat, you can hear someone mention that there‚Äôs a 5 year sentence for the person who did it if they were caught. 

I‚Äôm guessing that S2 is gonna probably involve a storyline where she may or may not get caught."
Leila,"I don't think it was irrelevant. It was to juxtapose against other incidents and the consequences characters face for them.

It also helped aid in Leila's characterization by showing her additional irrational bland criminal behavior."
Leila,[removed]
Leila,[removed]
Leila,The struggles are real but idk parts of it like including a 10 year old drug dealer with no explanation??

Leila,Jumping of the shark is not when a TV show does something that makes no sense. It‚Äôs when a show takes a turn for the worst and never recovers and you can identify the specific event after which it happened. 
Leila,Haven't tried it but I have a feeling it's getting cancelled.Though cw are soon not gonna have arrow supernatural Jane the virgin or crazy ex...maybe it will be saved
Leila,What's the big reveal?
Leila,"More specifically, it's an event in the story that was explicitly designed to pique declining interest (usually out of desperation). They usually fall flat or backfire completely, but there have been cases where it's worked."
Leila,There was an episode of Happy Days where a guy *literally* jumped over a shark... and it was the best one!
Leila,"I didn't research it, was going off common knowledge I guess I'll reterm it to something that works for me, or just use it in layman's ü§î"
Leila,"Although sometimes that thing that makes no sense is when it takes a turn for the worse.....

They have it labeled as using a gimmick also, but I would disagree. Many shows use gimmicks now & stay above the demise(like thatoneguy889 said). Crossovers used to be a gimmick, but it works most of the time. 

I would say when a main character is killed off, for whatever reason, they come back only to figure out that not having that main character changed the dynamic of the show. So they then decide to go even farther outside the original premise of the show, ie Sleepy Hollow. I still liked it, but I fully understood where everyone else was coming from."
Leila,[deleted]
Leila,R+L=J
Leila,"I‚Äôve never seen this nuance before, and I‚Äôm not totally convinced it‚Äôs true tbh"
Leila,That is where the expression comes from.
Leila,"Did you just call Arthur Fonzarelli ""a guy""?"
Leila,"Common knowledge-that's the problem. So many use it the wrong way.  A great way to envision it would be to take a something like The Wire, Nypd Blue, etc. and deciding to have a crossover with GoT."
Leila,"Really? Thank God, it was rough in few parts but I really enjoyed it. And Mark Pedowitz didn't rule out the renewal and implied they were watching the streaming numbers pretty closely before making the decision, so hopefully it does good on Netflix."
Leila,Yeah it comes from The Fonz literally jumping over a shark on water skis in Happy Days. Where the tone of the show was radically changed. It worked on Happy Days but usually never does.
Leila,"Yeah, I was trying to quote Troy from Community."
Leila,"Watched it all in a day and man did i love it. That cliffhanger to end the finale has me dying for next season, the support on netflix has been crazy, we need more."
Leila,"I know..... did you respond to the right comment?

edit: I literally hate this website sometimes"
Leila,"> I‚Äôve never seen this nuance before, and I‚Äôm not totally convinced it‚Äôs true tbh"
Leila,"I just didn‚Äôt know why you decided to tell me that. I didn‚Äôt really say anything that warranted that response 

What you said is also said in the same part of the post my original comment is replying to"
Leila,"I loved this show so much, i hope season 2 is just as good, i can't wait!"
Leila,"Brilliant, this quirky show really did have a great heart along with some solid laughs in the midst of some dark and personal struggles.

Can't wait to jump back in."
Leila,"I just binged S1 the other day. I meant to watch it first time around after seeing the ads but it got away from me.

It‚Äôs weird because it‚Äôs some unusual surreal thing about a ridiculous unreal family but there just seems to be something real something so true to it, especially regarding Maurice‚Äôs difficulty to tell his family how he really feels."
Leila,Season 1 was really really good. 
Leila,I need more Julian Barratt in my life
Jinn,No one's ever really Qui-gon.
Jinn,"Neeson's son will also voice a younger version of Qui-Gon Jinn.

The series will be a set of animated shorts exploring the background of different Jedi. Qui-Gon Jinn, Ahsoka, and Count Dooku are confirmed to have episodes.

The series is slated to [premiere](https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1530671079852675073?s=21&t=rn4LiQiPRWdhjJjLKug_dg) this Fall on Disney+."
Jinn,"Didn't he just say he would only consider returning as Qui-Gon if it was for a movie only?

Edit: [Just over a month ago lol](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a39762676/liam-neeson-tv-snob-disney-star-wars/)"
Jinn,So he‚Äôs definitely in another show then
Jinn,"If I had a dollar for each time we were surprised with a Liam Neeson cameo in 2022, I'd have three dollars which doesn't seem like a lot but it's weird that it happened three times in one year."
Jinn,THEY GOT MY MANS LIAM NEESONS? LIAM. NEESONS. IS. MY. SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT
Jinn,I'm still wondering when he'll pop up in Kenobi as a Force ghost. He's got to.
Jinn,"Disney is mining nostalgia at a hell of a pace.  

I can't help but think that within five years, they'll either have to make entirely new content, or reboot the whole franchise."
Jinn,"This is neat and all but you know what would be a really exciting star wars headline?

&#x200B;

""New Star Wars series announced, sources say it takes place on new planets you've never seen and has nothing to do with any characters or bloodlines you've ever met before"""
Jinn,I've heard that he did some [improvisational comedy](https://youtu.be/huJ81Mq2y34) in this rendition of his character.
Jinn,Hope we get to hear about the time a young and angry Qui-Gon took a speeder one night and drove it up and down the skyways of Coruscant fixing to force choke the first Kaminoan he could find.
Jinn,RIP Star Wars Visions?
Jinn,Good for him! Still healthy enough to work after he was diagnosed with full blown aids. Bless him.
Jinn,"When the title was leaked last month I assumed the premise would be a re-imagining of [the comics series from the '90s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Jedi) with the same name.

This still sounds pretty cool, and it's good to see Neeson returning to the franchise."
Jinn,No one‚Äôs ever *really* gone.
Jinn,Can't wait.
Jinn,I'm surprised Disney hasn't announced a live action Qui-Gon Jinn series starring Neeson that takes place before Phantom Menace.
Jinn,"""let's do some improvational comedy"""
Jinn,Imagine an animated series of the Jedi apprentice books.
Jinn,">An anthology of Original animated shorts, each story features Jedi from the prequel era.


So the only High Republic animation is that show for toddlers, huh?"
Jinn,Is this spoiling his upcoming appearance in Obi-Wan?
Jinn,Bruh this already dry
Jinn,***Star Wars*** - *Pining for the Fjords!*
Jinn,"Did not know about this, but after Star Wars Visions and Love, Death + Robots, and of course the OG Clone Wars cartoon, I'm all for some more high quality animated anthology series in my life."
Jinn,nobody cares.
Jinn,"Disney milking every drop from the Star Wars IP is why they bought it, we are going to end up with 100 different Star Wars shows lmao can‚Äôt wait"
Jinn,"We really need to learn more about the Jedi afterlife, and this would be a great opportunity to give Hamill and Oz much larger roles and to stretch artistically."
Jinn,This pleases the fans
Jinn,Hopefully he doesn't have to voice any fence jumping scenes :P
Jinn,"Wasn't Tales of the Jedi a comic book series set in the Old Republic? 

They took the name and turned into an animated series not about the Old Republic?

I like Qui-Gon, I like the Clone Wars, I like the prequel era. But Star Wars really, really needs to move on from the Skywalker saga."
Jinn,Please stop ruining Star Wars.
Jinn,Saw the first episode today at Star Wars Celebration.
Jinn,"For some reason my brain read Leslie Neilson, and I thought,""That will be weird, isn't he dead?"""
Jinn,"The dhow sucks, at least first two episodes, saw them two days ago, I can‚Äôt remember a single scene because of how forgetful it was."
Jinn,This oversaturation is going to severely damage Star Wars and Marvel.
Jinn,Please please please please please ditch the art style of the clone wars.
Jinn,Jedis have a certain set of skills.
Jinn,He'll probably also come back in Obi-Wan Kenobi as a de-aged force ghost.
Jinn,Why didn‚Äôt Liam want to appear in the new series?
Jinn,"he should have been the villain for the sequel movies,  mysteriously reappearing without explanation (clone gone evil) everyone wondering who the F is this guy knowing everything from the past except us the audience (it's Qui-Gon! he should be dead!), putting up a nice front just enough to make you want to believe it's for real, while doing sinister stuff on the side (after all he wad dooku's padawan). Palpatine had access to his body (died im the Naboo palace) and known to experiment with life extension through cloning and/or consciousness transfer. The actor is in a good shape to play him and has the gravitas both as a good and bad character. Add some digitally de aged flashbacks with McGregor to flush it out."
Jinn,I‚Äôm so ready for this. I absolutely love Qui-Gon Jinn and the dynamic of his relationship with the Jedi
Jinn,The Jedi PSA about the dangers of alcoholism
Jinn,"I AM CONVINCED THERE IS CHRISTMAS IN MAY

they're blessing us with all these SW content!!"
Jinn,I‚Äôve always said we need more Qui-Gon Jinn. I‚Äôm excited
Jinn,Holy moly. This should a what if series
Jinn,All I want is Exar Kun and Ulic qel Droma‚Äôs saga. Why must they tease me?!
Jinn,That Taken free ride went completely off the rails.
Jinn,C‚Äômon. No one should be surprised when he appears as a force ghost in ep 6 of Kenobi.
Jinn,"He‚Äôs in episodes 4,5,6 of Kenobi too"
Jinn,Fuck yeah baby
Jinn,"I used to not be able to watch the animated star wars stuff because it seemed too childish.  But, I grew into rebels, really enjoying it and now I'm enjoying the Bad Batch even more, much to my own surprise! So yeah, looking forward to this."
Jinn,Who cares. Gina Carano was right about everything. #CancelDisneyPlus
Jinn,Qui gon wouldn‚Äôt be the same without his voice
Jinn,‚ÄòUSE THE FORCE NOW! WE‚ÄôRE RUNNING OUT OF TIME!‚Äô
Jinn,"there is so much star wars content out there to be adapted and they just continuously keep re-hashing skywalker era stuff... for gods sake show some fucking creativity, there is infinite possibilities in the star wars universe"
Jinn,With how much Kenobi is calling on him in his show I'd be surprised if Qui-Gon doesn't show up as a Force ghost near the end.
Jinn,Qui-gon. Why did you make me train that boy. He killed everyone!! - obi wan probably
Jinn,qui gon was one of my favorite characters from episode 1. he always believed in the boy though and he was pretty much responsible for anakin going all crazy. If he hadn't been so insistent about the boy maybe Anakin stays on that sand planet lol
Jinn,Rumour has it they will exhume Christopher Lee's vocal chords so he can posthumously voice Count Dooku.
Jinn,Baby Ahsoka ?! Count me in !
Jinn,"Sounds more like Clone Wars without the Clone Wars to me.

Not bad by any means. But I was hoping for some anthology all over, maybe even High Republic."
Jinn,"I feel like none of those three need an episode highlighting their adventures. Especially not Ahsoka, but she‚Äôs Filoni‚Äôs ‚Äúcreator pet‚Äù so I get it."
Jinn,Haven't we had like 15 seasons of content on Ahsokas background?
Jinn,"Yeah he was probably joking, especially since he will probably be in Kenobi."
Jinn,"Liam Neeson is an expert troll. He was being extremely sarcastic when he said that.

Since then he's appeared in two television shows just this year."
Jinn,This man is pulling an Andrew Garfield on us.
Jinn,Probably meant live action. He‚Äôs done voices in Clone Wars before
Jinn,He was in an episode of clone wars
Jinn,As soon as I saw his cameo in Atlanta I knew this statement was BS.
Jinn,"The way Obi-Wan was calling for him in in the first episode of Kenobi, it feels like they are setting it up for an appearance later on."
Jinn,Hes FOR SURE showing up in obi wan
Jinn,What where other cameos?
Jinn,"*Hello there*  

""Hey, that's my line"""
Jinn,I'm sure if the sequels had been recieved / made better they'd probably have made a bunch of sequel era content by now.
Jinn,"They definitely aren‚Äôt rebooting it yet.

There‚Äôs new content in the works. Skeleton crew is a show with no known connections with anything yet"
Jinn,Did someone say Mickey Mouse club reboot?!
Jinn,"The Acolyte, the high republic series being worked on, seems like it will be just that."
Jinn,Guess you haven't heard of the Acolyte
Jinn,"Check out The High Republic. It‚Äôs the current main story in the EU at the moment and it‚Äôs extremely good and, more importantly, almost wholly original. New characters, new planets, new ships, new villains, new weapons, etc. They‚Äôve announced one game and two shows for it so far so it‚Äôs coming to screens soon, but definitely check out the main trilogy of books at the moment and see how you feel. 

Best Star Wars in years."
Jinn,The planet‚Äôs name is‚Ä¶is‚Ä¶Enioottat!
Jinn,That's literally the High Republic but Star Wars fans dismissed it the moment they announced it.
Jinn,Which is what the original Tales of the Jedi *was*. It was set thousands of years prior to the originals so it could tackle new planets and new characters and new aesthetics without being beholden to the films. To reuse its name for a tie in like this is kind of appaling.
Jinn,"The Acolyte and probably Taika Waititi‚Äôs movie, which is next up

But I don‚Äôt see the problem in wanting more stories with characters you love. I‚Äôve wanted a story about young Dooku and Qui-Gon for a long time and the Ahsoka show looks great"
Jinn,That's what Star Wars Visions was.
Jinn,"Liam is playing the long game, setting up a running gag"
Jinn,Plot twist: that's why Kamino deleted themselves from all the databases in the first place.
Jinn,They confirmed Visions 2 is in the works. Some folks said it will drop 2022 but I think it will be pushed to 2023 after this news dropped.
Jinn,The dead speak!
Jinn,Yet.
Jinn,"He 70, they‚Äôre not going to do that"
Jinn,No
Jinn,Then why are you commenting if you don‚Äôt care?
Jinn,Disagree
Jinn,They may just end up midichlorine 2.0ing it though. Some things are best just left to the imagination.
Jinn,I'll try but it isn't like I work at Disney or anything.
Jinn,Details? Can‚Äôt leave it at that bro!
Jinn,"I once read awhile back when they were casting The Clone Wars, they had gone through the process of finding a voice match but still brought Lee in just in case. Upon hearing Corey Burton‚Äôs Count Dooku: Lee basically asked why they bothered calling him in when Burton‚Äôs match was so good."
Jinn,Cal me ootl but I had NO idea he passed away.... Damn.
Jinn,"Twice the pride, double the fall."
Jinn,They'll go the kingdom hearts route and get Yen Sid to voice him.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,WHAT'S UP EVERYBODY I THINK DOGS SHOULD VOTE
Super Monsters Monster Pets,What is going on here? Not once did I see anyone wearing a backpack to carry their applesauce!
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Disappointed that this isn't the story of 2 brothers creating hideous but lovable characters using various video game character creators...
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Im glad we will finally get to see the sequel to dogs
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Monster Factory as in the Pro Wrestling school?

The same Monster Factory that gave us; 

- Punishment Martinez/ Damian Priest.

- Cody Vance/ Number 10/ Presten Vance.

- Nick Comoroto.

- Matt Riddle.

- Karen Q.

- etc etc etc."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Just like Bart.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Monster Factory follows two brothers, Griffin and Justin McElroy as they stream themselves using ingame character creators to build the wildiest, depraved yet hilarious characters possible by mainly sticking to the golden rule of ""Only extreme values no middle ground"".  Often giving characters pencil thing heads with elongated noses and green hair etc.

Can't believe they made a tv show out of it and the trailer confuses me but I'm sure it's just as good."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,I really hoped Ja'am would have made the trailer
Super Monsters Monster Pets,They really should have Googled this title beforehand.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I hate wrestling bouts. Hate wrestling fanboys.

But behind-the-scenes stuff has always been interesting to me. And this show looks awesome!"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Well this came out of nowhere!
Super Monsters Monster Pets,SO MUCH BLOOD!

Super Monsters Monster Pets,"What the hell, I don't see The Final Pam anywhere?!"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"JACOOOOOOOOOOOOOB

Super Monsters Monster Pets,[deleted]
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Is this related to the 90s computer game they used in school to teach us math?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,BABY NEED SNACK
Super Monsters Monster Pets,I don't think so
Super Monsters Monster Pets,It clearly is
Super Monsters Monster Pets,METAL HUSBAND
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I remember the main problem at the time was the setting.  HBO wanted to chance the setting to US instead of Germany to make it more accessible and for their audience which doesn‚Äôt work story wise.   I think today this issue would be moot.  There have been a lot of internationally set dramas that have found a wide audience.

The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.   That just doesn‚Äôt fly in Hollywood.   Maybe if it became del toros passion project but nobody is putting up that much time and money without the rights."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Fucking A man, totally agree with all of this. The anime is incredible, as is the manga. I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone **especially those who don‚Äôt like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime. It‚Äôs more comparable to a David Fincher film.

The story is just too good to never be adapted, so we‚Äôll get it someday. But yeah, Del Toro would‚Äôve been an ideal person to oversee an adaptation. He said they were shopping it to networks after the HBO deal fell through, but nothing ever came of it, so idk why no one would be interested in a Del Toro written and directed pilot. It hits the exact same demos of something like True Detective."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Here is the opening and ending of the anime, to those that are interested.

Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Monster is one of the, if not *the*, greatest anime of all time. I highly recommend it. It draws you in with the suspense and tension and then you stay for how amazing and layered the characters are."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"If you've never watched Monster, please, go watch one of the best pieces of media put out. Don't judge it because it's an anime. It's a long discussion about the nature of evil, the impact of genetics versus society on the formation of the individual, the rippling consequences of evil . . . I could go on. Johan Liebert is genuinely a frightening villain, and for a long time in the anime, I was truly debating whether he was the antichrist. An incredible show.

Edit: I just remembered the final scene and I'm haunted."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Now that i think about it, the manga/anime reminds me of Zodiac, Mindhunter and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo from David Fincher.

It explores a lot of darkness within humanity and the ways in which we judge morality."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,This knowledge that you‚Äôve given me that this adaptation was in the works but canned has depressed me. Excellent anime and manga in my top 5. Would‚Äôve made a killer series
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I just don‚Äôt know that the animated Johan translates into live action, for numerous reasons. There are so many incredible characters that I think *would* work in a live setting, but I‚Äôm just not sure you could adapt the twins in a satisfying way."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption. It's not like they don't have the talent to do it; all they lack is money, but if they were to work with some big streaming service that would give them enough freedom and a decent budget, then it should be fine. 

HBO and Del Toro would certainly do a good job, but they would also adapt it to the western taste. I'd rather have someone like Kurosawa do it.

Anyway, it will probably never happen, but at least we have a great anime adaption."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Sounds dumb
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Considering all the other live action adaptations Hollywood has done over the years a Monster  live action series seems like the one with greatest chance of doing well.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Wish someone could do a live action of any Naoki Urusawa's works.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I think now more than ever would be the perfect time to adapt it. Streaming services such as Netflix have proved that international productions work, and so if it were to be a German production (or perhaps Czech co-production) it would still likely find a pretty large audience. But I also wouldn't mind an English-language version so long as it's faithful to the setting (like Fincher's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo). And whereas in the past you'd likely get a whitewashed version of Tenma's character, I'd think these days studios wouldn't forego an Asian lead."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"IIRC it was an interview with Del Toro in the past couple years, but I think I remember him saying it‚Äôs still on his list of dream projects. With Pluto getting an anime adaptation (*fucking finally*) I could see him revisiting trying to push Monster given the author is in the limelight again. He‚Äôs at the point in his career where he‚Äôs in his right to approach a studio with an IP or concept with genuine enthusiasm from the studio.  

Also yeah today things could be done in the US given the current political climate, but I also think HBO would be more receptive to having the series in its original setting nowadays."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Who in their right mind would want it set in America? The setting, the story is German with literal nazi‚Äôs and eugenics."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,">The other issue was Naoki Urasawa (the original author) wanted del Toro and HBO to write the whole series and go intro production before he would sign over rights to make sure it was made to his vision.

Good for him for having the balls to make that play. Hollywood has a horrible track record for live action anime adaptations, worse than video game adaptations. More mangakas should be way more protective about their IP when Hollywood comes knocking."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Yeah, i guess the behind the scenes of this production would be a little more tricker than i expected.

The US setting would be a big No No.

I could see the german couple that did Netflix's Dark making a good adaptation.

Dark had a lot of 1980s Germany scenes in it and there was a lot of good character drama and exploration of the human psyche, alongside some philosophies of what it means to live and die."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Honestly, that is also how i tried to convince some of my friends to watch it.

The **anime for those that don't like anime** and that is comparable to a David Fincher film/series, as pretentious as that may possibly sound.

HBO would have been the best network for it, beyond a doubt.

They could probably make 3 seasons of this, 10 episodes each.

The week to week releases as the mystery gets darker and darker would be great to witness in a live-action format."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Unfortunately the tv spending spree is coming to an end. That said, Monster would be a much less expensive production than 98% of other anime adapted projects out there. There could be hope if there are people who really want to get it done."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"
>I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone **especially those who don‚Äôt like anime** as it contains none of the usual tropes one associated with anime.

Haha,  that was me! I wasn't into sci-fi, ninjas, robots, or goofy comedy animes, but my friend showed me the 1st episode of Monster when it came out, and I was hooked. I'm a big Fincher fan too.

That was the gateway for me to get into Urasawa's other works (20th Century Boys, Billy Bat), plus other dark/psychological animes like Satoshi Kon's work (Perfect Blue,  Paranoia Agent)."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"The character studies in this are incredible. There is this short story told by this old man when he used to be a sniper. He was assigned to kill this businessman. He observes the man from distance, ready to kill him. The man is putting sugar in his coffee and the sniper thinks he'll pull the trigger when the man finishes stirring his coffee and take a sip of it. But the man keeps on adding sugar in his coffee over and over again and the sniper simply can't shoot anymore and quits his job. There is this another story of his man who killed a guy in a park and from that day on birds won't come in the park anyone. Or that story of the old couple going to visit their son.  Even the one-off characters are so layered."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,One of the captured serial killers reminded me a lot of Ed Kemper too.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,">To be honest, I would prefer if Japan itself made the adaption.

I feel like Japan would be one of the worst countries to adapt this given the material. Like the entire cast is white besides Tenma and a few minor characters, and the story being set in Germany is a pretty integral aspect of the series (there‚Äôs a whole subplot in the show about neo-nazi‚Äôs that wouldn‚Äôt make sense if they were played by a bunch of Japanese guys)."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,so do most drama shows when you try to think about them.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Good for him making an unreasonable demand? No show will ever get made like that. 

I could see saying that if he simply said ‚Äúno‚Äù to development partners he didn‚Äôt like or trust. But you can‚Äôt just ask people to spend millions of dollars making something before deciding to sign off or not. It‚Äôs unreasonable. At some point you have to have some faith in the people you are choosing to work with."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,For sure.  I‚Äôm torn now - I‚Äôd have loved to see this a decade ago on HBO with.  But these days Netflix is more likely to pick this up - theyve had more success with international shows and the 3 season maximum is a draw for their model - But I feel like a lower budget Netflix version would make me sad when this should get the HBO Last of Us/Westworld/GoT production value.  But I guess these days Warner/Discover is having their own $$ issues‚Ä¶
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I think 4 seasons would be ideal, just because there are natural season finale endpoints in volume 4 where >!Tenma is tied up in the loading dock by racists and the building is set on fire!< , and in volume 9 where >!Tenma sees Johan at the library and tries to kill him!< 

It would be so cool because although he‚Äôs the protagonist, Tenma goes in and out of the series a lot while you follow other characters. If they did 4 seasons, they‚Äôd likely have to do one season where the lead character is barely in it! 

It‚Äôs funny, because regarding THAT choice >!Tenma!< has to make at the end, I could see what he decided to do being extremely controversial nowadays and massively hated similarly to The Last of us 2 or The Last Jedi. But I thought it was great!"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Well said. Plus every single minor character has a role to play and some payoff. There isn‚Äôt a single episode of filler.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Yep. 5 scoops of sugar, same as the sniper."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I was mostly referring to the potential team behind it: the writer, director, composer etc. Japan has a lot of talented artists and it would be great if they took part in a potential global hit.

The best option imo would be a collab between Japan and Germany. That would make the most faithful adaption."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"yeah, i won't deny that"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"People make demands like this instead of saying no. There was probably some weird clause in the contract giving them rights based on other contingencies but you can weasel out of it by demanding too much.

It‚Äôs way more common than you think."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,you are bonkers if you think netflix has a lower budget than hbo
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I don't think the ending would be as controversial as those 2.

The Last of Us Part 2 and The Last Jedi have to deal with the fact that they are dealing and removing past and lovable characters from the story, while the Monster ending would simply end things."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I said 10 years ago.  Maybe it‚Äôs closer to 12 now, but yes.

Edit: No a decade was perfect House of Cards was 2013."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Isbell:

>When I saw some of the show, it bothered me, especially when I saw myself ‚Äî when I saw my name come across the screen and this lady saying verbatim exactly what I said. 

>If I didn't know any better, I would've thought it was me. Her hair was like mine, she had on the same clothes. That's why it felt like reliving it all over again. It brought back all the emotions I was feeling back then.

>I was never contacted about the show. I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it. They didn't ask me anything. They just did it.

>I could even understand it if they gave some of the money to the victims' children. Not necessarily their families. I mean, I'm old. I'm very, very comfortable. But the victims have children and grandchildren. If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn't feel so harsh and careless.

>It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"At the very least, the creators or producers could've prepared the victim's families that the show was being made.  It's recent enough where people can be contacted."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,I think it shines a pretty big light on the shitty public service Milwaukee police gave Dahmers neighbor Glenda Cleveland when she expressed grave concern for the 14 year old kid practically unconscious said to be Jeffrey‚Äôs boyfriend
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I can understand how she feels. All I can say is that before watching this show, Dahmer is the only name I knew from this mess. I'm no less revolted by him now. And going forward I will now remember some of his victims. Who they were before meeting him and at least a sense of who they could have been if they hadn't. As well as poor Glenda and the incompetent police officers."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,I get it but I really do think the series was very important. It finally showed how Dahmer actually got away with it because of racial inequalities and the corrupt police. Not because he was some kind of super genius.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"It‚Äôs weird when people lump this show in with just true crime porn when the reality is this show highlights the failings of the police that no true crime doc did.  Every single one has Milwaukee police acting like Dahmer is some super smart guy, but the reality that this show correctly points out is Milwaukee doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the black and gay community, which is a very important story to tell.  Sure we can probably use other ways to tell that story, but this drives traffic, tragedy.  And that traffic will now be people who know just how shit the cops were when Dahmer committed those crimes.

Edit-thank you for the additional context friends!  Amended ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt‚Äù to ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt‚Äù"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"This particular series hits me different.  I can‚Äôt argue that it is not exploitive of the victims and their memories but it feels different than a lot of the other cash ins that we have seen over the years.

I lived in MKE during this time, my father worked with the guy and I‚Äôve still never been able to fully wrap my head around the horrific nature of these crimes.  I‚Äôve known the body count, the conversion, the cannibalism and plans for an altar made out of his victims but nothing ever felt as vivid as when I watched this series.  Having it all played out right in front of you really gave me a sense of who these victims really were, especially Tony Hughes and Konerak.  I know time couldn‚Äôt be given to all 17 victims but my heart definitely feels incredible sadness when I think of all the families.  It went from being something that was a huge historical marker in my hometown to a realization of the depravity of these crimes."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"thats how I feel about the whole true crime genre, tbh"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"At the end of the day it‚Äôs an event that happened, you cannot stop anyone from talking about it or even making shows/movies about it just because it upsets you. How many WW2 documentaries have you seen, or documentaries and movies on events that are traumatic?"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I'm not saying she's wrong but there's like dozens of series in Bundy, Gacy, mass murderers, 9/11, epstein, drugs, murder, rape and every other horror in the world. 

They make money off all of those tragedies but it's not like Dahmer was presented improperly to be glorified, nor his victims to be shown in a poor light. 

I don't understand why series should stop being made based in true stories, Netflix didn't invent that idea.

Why shouldn't a series be made on Dahmer? He's incredibly interesting. It wouldn't have been made if there wasn't a massive demand for that content, you could argue all the people who demand it are in the wrong but it is what it is. 

I'm sick of shows about 9/11, Diana and the Titanic but they still get made because it's ingrained in peoples minds."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,What about war films? Gangster films? Literally any story ever told about any kind of tragic event? Sometimes Reddit‚Äôs horse is too fucking high and it irks me.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,So every war movie ever made is off limits?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,So basically like every other thing ever made?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I don‚Äôt know, I watched it. It (yet again) high lighted a real short coming in America‚Äôs response to policing poor and possibly exploited peoples. 

I grew up in the 90s when there was this mystique that serial killers were intelligent methodical killers that had a message and blah blah blah. (See movies like Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Copy Cat, Kiss the Girls, Bone Collector, etc)

But after watching Dahmer, that movie about Bundy and some other docs/movies/shows these guys were lucky the cops sucked at their jobs. Dahmer should have been caught so many times but nobody wanted to listen, he was a total fuck up. 

I think the Netflix show does a good job of humanizing all of these people that Dahmer killed. I didn‚Äôt think it glorified anything about how he killed any of those people, in fact they barely show any actual violence or the messed up things he did."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Man this kind of stuff shits me off.

It reminds me of when NITRAM was being filmed, the movie about spree killer, Martin Bryant. Apparently the residents of Tasmania basically crusaded against the filming of the movie, forcing the movie to be filmed in Geelong, Melbourne. South-Central Victoria is flat and has mainland flora; Hobart is mountainous with a constant view of the lake and ocean and has Jurassic-era ferns. The difference is noticable.

Now, I was 4 when it happened. There were victims younger than I was. It happened 30-ish minutes drive from where I lived. Half of the movie is set 20 minute walk from where I was at the time. Had he not moved to Port Arthur a couple of years prior to the massacre, the spree killing would have happened, likely at the Polish Club on the corner of Clare Street, Augusta Road, and New Town Road, or the Friend's School that was across the road. [Either way, only about a 4-10 minute walk from the house his girlfriend/mother figure that he killed lived at] (https://imgur.com/a/OQL0IRd), or somewhere equally packed. I wasn't a victim but I could have been and pretty much everyone knows someone who is a victim, or knows someone who knows someone. The shadow of Martin Bryant looms over every Tasmanian. 

Every Australian knows who Martin Bryant is because he's the guy responsible for firearms being heavily restricted in Australia. He'll always be infamous for that. In fact, one of the biggest complaints about the movie was that ""it's a true crime about one of the most horrific days in Australian history so as to teach Americans that guns are bad.""

The reason I even said all of that preamble is to say that despite all of that, I think the movie needed to be made. But now, when I watch the movie, I'm constantly distracted by the fact that despite being raised around the STREET that half the movie is set in, and know every location that is supposedly being shown, I don't recognise any of it because it's filmed in Geelong, Victoria. 

The fact that the movie almost never got made because some people thought it was inappropriate subject matter. The victims having a problem with it is one thing but the Tasmanian Leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Police Union? Why?"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Jokes on them - Netflix doesn‚Äôt make money.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Same shit is happening with the gabby petito murder. Lifetime tv is about to release a series on the case with re-enactments. It‚Äôs only been a year. 

It‚Äôs disgusting Hollywood again"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"This thread is essentially people realizing that true crime as a genre is profiting off the pain of families, but justifying it because they like it.

These ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù were real people. 
Imagine the worst day of your life being used as entertainment again and again for the profit of someone that doesn‚Äôt even know you. 

I‚Äôve had to explain to friends why I didn‚Äôt want to watch certain shows when it was the same way a family member died. Had to explain that I don‚Äôt want to talk about the deaths of friends like they‚Äôre gossip. 

It‚Äôs easy for people to disassociate, but we really need to reassess and understand that this is not fiction."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"This is absurd. To begin with, anything (film, show, documentary, book) that explores stuff that humans did in the past will cost money to produce and will need to be sold. Nobody works for free. Also, we can't really pretend stuff like this didn't happen and treat it like a taboo."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,So should we never make stories based on history?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,I‚Äôve never understood why there‚Äôs never any complaints like this made about war movies? Isn‚Äôt that glorifying a tragedy that affects way more people?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,If you're affected why would you watch this? That's like watching 9/11 footage when your parent died in the building.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,How do they make money off it when anyone watching it is paying a flat rate to watch anything?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,There was a series called Criminal Minds and not all stories were completely imaginary and it went on tv for over a decade
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"People on social media are so cringe about this show, posting their dumb ass thirst memes about Dahmer who was a huge piece of shit on top of being a murderer, same way they did when Zac Efron made that movie about him years ago, people have rocks for brains"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,I came out of watching that pissed off at the police and the system that let these people down.  Shows like this that highlight everything that went wrong only help to prevent it happening again in the future.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Sorry to be an asshole about this, but it worked for the bulk of Zodiac Killer, Charles Manson, Hitler, Stalin, Confederate era, Medieval, Roman era/based on movies&TV Shows. 

Yes, it's dramatically reenacted entertainment first with the intent of making money off of it...but this also can help make more people aware of the tragedy. Also make viewers generally interested in stories related to the discussions about mental health in general. Great, now I wish Mindhunter would get another season soon.

Yes, we understand how awful it all was for those involved. Nobody is denying it, but this is history and entertainment based on the principal 101. Aka Hollywood. Not sure what anybody is expecting at this rate outside of those involved people getting proper adaptations of...which is an entirely different discussion altogether."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I don't understand why we feel the need to rehash the same true crime stories over and over and over and over again. Dahmer is one of the ""household name"" killers. Why do we need a fictionalized recreation starring a pretty actor? I felt the same way about the Ted Bundy movie with Zac Efron."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Well yes.. But isn't every ww2 movie that as well?
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"This happened to my cousin about 6 or 7 years ago. She got involved with a religious sex cult and her husband presumably murdered her but covered it up as a suicide (spoiler alert, he‚Äôs still free). It was high profile enough to get a dedicated segment on 60 minutes and a Lifetime movie based on it. People got paid from this while my uncle, aunt, and remaining cousins were given continuous reminders that their daughter/sister is no longer here."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I'm sure she has enjoyed media that made people related to the event feel the same way she feels.

Dahmer's story should be told as a warning of what can happen to marginalized communities, which we seem to never learn and need to be constantly reminded of."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"‚Ä¶ I mean. I could see that. But, it‚Äôs a way to keep the tragedies relevant, imo. It‚Äôs horrific. And it being loosely based on a true story makes it intriguing. They‚Äôre gunna make they‚Äôre money either way. I‚Äôd rather it be something with layers than filmed in brail. Jmo. And Evan Peters is freakin awesome."
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"It‚Äôs sad that they‚Äôre telling a story about a real-life event?

Is she also pissed at every world war 2 movie? Every 9/11 documentary? Every single god damn atrocity?"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"Yup, I never understood why people idolized serial killers. Blows my mind"
Super Monsters Monster Pets,What made Dahmer so extra creepy was that he looked so normal in court. This actor LOOKS insane. At least Manson had the courtesy to look like a lunatic.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,Or. They are telling a history and they made money for their work in its representation. It‚Äôs not like all those WW2 movies and documentaries were just out to make a quick buck on the suffering of Jews. Or how Roots was made to make money off slaves.
Super Monsters Monster Pets,"I went to hear Monica Lewinsky speak recently and she talked about being a producer on the Hulu series about the affair. She spoke about how important it was to be involved and control the narrative after the media and so many others distorted her image. Consent is something we don‚Äôt talk about with private citizens being thrust into the public spotlight. I feel for victims of violent crimes and their families, it‚Äôs even more important they be involved and consulted. If they don‚Äôt consent then that should be respected even if cases are public record. my own family was touched by a hate crime and went through public trial and it was very traumatic. The things strangers say about victims, and the victim blaming etc is awful and I can imagine these families have heard it all sadly. Time for us to move on."
Tales of the City,i felt this was masterfully done.
Tales of the City,"I wish reddit was more receptive to content like this, but the cynic in me says this won't go as far as it deserves."
Tales of the City,"hm... interesting...

truly a complex topic

wish the young man wouldn't have quit the discussion so early

but thx for showing this... the show was under my radar until now... def. going on my watch-list"
Tales of the City,"I loved this scene so much. He's defending his ""privilege"" because they ""earned it"". But, they uses his privilege to use slurs and laugh about transexual people (in the context of talking about transexual people on a third world country on a place where you had to ring a bell to get in). They went through the pain but didn't get a shred of empathy in the process."
Tales of the City,I've never heard of this show. What's the context for this scene?
Tales of the City,Nitpicky but uggghh there are no *Sherpas* in Peru !!
Tales of the City,I think this is an amazing topic to bring up but the dialogue itself feels a little forced.
Tales of the City,Every part of this is annoying and preachy.
Tales of the City,"It was a powerful speech, but his entire argument was a strawman."
Tales of the City,Just from the trailer it seems incredibly sappy
Tales of the City,"Michael (Mouse) bumped into an old frenemy (used to date; they broke up when Mouse was HIV+), who invited him and his SO to a dinner party. The SO is much younger, hence the ""generational"" clash that happens.

*Tales of the City* is more famous as a series of nine books written by Armistead Maupin from 1978 to 2014. It was originally published serially (daily!) in the *San Francisco Chronicle.*  And it's a series of stories that revolve around the straight/gay/trans/etc. residents of 28 Barbary Lane. Michael ""Mouse"" Tolliver is the main central character of the series, often seen as an alter-ego character for Maupin. Whose husband, photographer Christopher Turner, is much younger than he is. :)

The first book of the series, *Tales of the City* was made into an award-winning TV miniseries for PBS's *American Playhouse* and UK's Channel 4 in 1993. It later would be part of the fuel behind the GOP's insistence on cutting federal funding for the arts. So *More Tales of the City* in 1998 and *Further Tales of the City* in 2001 were done by Showtime. Netflix has none of these three series.

Channel 4 never adapted the three middle books of the series, *Babycakes*, *Significant Others,* and *Sure of You*, which ended with Mouse testing HIV+.

Maupin would then take a 18-year break before publishing the next book in the series, *Michael Tolliver Lives!* and then ending the series with *Mary Ann in Autumn* and *The Days of Mrs. Madrigal*.

This Netflix series (again produced by Alan Poul for Channel Four but this time written by *Orange is the New Black*'s head writer, Lauren Morelli) focuses more on *Mary Ann in Autumn.* 

Netflix, btw, also has a documentary, *The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin.*"
Tales of the City,Real shocked that a member of /r/againstgaymarriage and /r/alt_anti_lgbt is annoyed by gay people talking about being gay.
Tales of the City,"fyi the owner of r/againstgaymarriage claimed it so it couldn't be claimed by people who genuinely believed it. here's the first post in the sub:

> Hate speech is unacceptable. Hijacking government to enforce some particular religion on everyone else is unacceptable.

> If you don't like gay marriage, don't have one, and leave it at that.

>  No, you can't have this subreddit. No, you can't post here. No, that doesn't oppress you; no, it doesn't infringe on your right to free speech.

> You have no valid argument Against Gay Marriage. Every single argument you have boils down to ""because someone said so"", which is authoritarianism. Yes, even that argument. Maybe this will eventually be replaced with an exhaustive list. Or maybe you will have to do your own homework.

> if you came here in earnest hoping to network and take action and rally against gay marriage:

> Shame. It's what you should be feeling, at this moment.

> If you came here against gay marriage, and now aren't experiencing shame, there's something deeply wrong with you, and likely with the culture you exist in. Something deeply damaging and dysfunctional, something against personal freedoms, liberty, and equality. That's the truth. That's something you were never told enough.

> And because you were never told that enough, you are now a footsoldier of fascism.

> Don't like that? Good news: the choice is yours to change yourself.

kind of a nice bait and switch for something that sounds horrible on the surface"
Tales of the City,"Ok fair enough in that respect, but that isn‚Äôt the only thing what annoyed me. 

Just because you suffered doesn‚Äôt mean you can be mean about other people. The way it is written is incredibly biased/weighted  and preachy.

It was nice to see Bulldog though."
Tales of the City,"> Just because you suffered doesn‚Äôt mean you can be mean about other people. The way it is written is incredibly biased/weighted and preachy.

I think that's the point. The main character of this story is the black man, and he is right. He's just outgunned in that room, which is why he leaves. He's never going to get through to those people, and it's infuriating to hear them say that shit."
Tales of the City,"Wow you type fast lol

Ok sure. I thought the POV was the older guys. Apart from his white privilege gobshite I didn‚Äôt mind his POV. 

Creepy age gap though."
Tales of the City,"Well now I feel bad about all the things I assumed about you. 

For what it's worth, what I find great about this scene and the writing is that, while I absolutely empathize more with Charlie (the black man) I totally expect others to agree and empathize more with the rest of the dinner guests. The writing is doing a good job of representing both sides of this sort of argument, and that is a pretty rare thing."
Tales of the City,"Ha no, it‚Äôs fine you‚Äôre probably right. 

While I don‚Äôt empathise with any of them, I guess I can see how it‚Äôs illustrating the difference between generations. It just initially felt to me like the older guys got a better chance to make a speech and outnumber the younger one, and his white privilege point was used to make him seem annoying. I‚Äôd guess I‚Äôd need to know the context."
Tales of the City,"I guess perspective is everything but that old boring 90s mini series was EVERYTHING when I was a 15 year old little gay boy being introduced to beloved gay characters. I sped through all the books immediately afterwards.

However, when Armistead Maupin started returning to Barbary Lane a few years ago I really disliked the saccharine sweetness of his characters friendships. With an open mind I thought I would check out Tales of the city when it dropped on netflix but 20 minutes in this morning I found Im having the same trouble with this new show as I had with the new additions to the book series.

Im not sure if its the show or just my own jaded cynicism 30 years later but I find characters I once loved (plus the new additions) to be a little too nauseating for my tastes."
Tales of the City,"Watching it now and many things are bugging me. 

I started reading Tales when it was a column in the paper... and then devoured the books.

I have to say I hated Laura Linney as Maryanne (though I like LL in other roles). 

There's a lot that just doesn't ring true/right. I particularly hated the ""outrage"" of Margot after being asked if she had children by a stranger that it was meant as an assumption that they were a straight couple. I know it was meant to establish that they were *not*, but god, there's a better way. NO ONE in SF assumes that *anyone* is *anything* if they ask if they have a child... jeez. 

And why is Ben so pissy towards Maryanne? And why is Maryanne's husband a homophobe? He can be a dick without referring to Maryanne's friends as ""those people""? And wtf was Margot's ""performance"" in the bar? That was silly, stupid and boring. 

And the whole premise of lying to Shawna for 25 years about her true parentage? I call total, utter bullshit. We're talking about her growing up in a community of openness and honesty and being true to oneself, being who one really is... and they ALL lie for 25 years??? 

Argh."
Tales of the City,"The timeline is bizarre with this. They use most of the old cast so it's presented as a direct continuation of the PBS/Showtime adaptations, but if it is then it should be taking place in the 90's, not 2019."
Tales of the City,"Oooh, I‚Äôm gonna watch this just to see Paul Gross looks like nowadays. That was a mighty fine Mountie."
Tales of the City,Mary Ann is obnoxious as fuck but Im glad to see diverse characters. Kinda hard to find a show with queer chars where their entire story/personality isnt just their sexuality lol
Tales of the City,No shortage of mediocre shows out there
Tales of the City,This was an old boring miniseries that was on back in the 90's so I guess they are reviving it.
Tales of the City,"Agree, much sweeter/blander and completely lacking in the edge/drive of the 1993 miniseries. But I think being a straight viewer who's only read the older books, I'm less invested, and I'm four episodes in, so far. It does get a *little* better, with a few callouts to the older stuff, but I'm mostly just there for Ellen Page, the older characters/actors (Victor Garber!), and to find out what happens.  And while I'm not as invested in the newer/younger characters aside from Shawna, they're not ticking me off, either.

Overall, I think if 20 minutes was enough to toss you out, you're not missing anything."
Tales of the City,I'm also ticked off at the music that plays every time LL appears. It's overly hopeful to the point of parody and here's with the tone of the show
Tales of the City,I've never heard of the show but just popped it on and found it quite nauseating for all those points you mentioned.
Tales of the City,That is driving me crazy.  Shawna should be in her late 30s - Brian in his 70s...Anna 100..
Tales of the City,Silver fox. See also: the wonderful *Alias Grace* miniseries
Tales of the City,"\[facepalm\].  Boring enough to be used as an example in Congress as the kind of filth the NEA/CPB was wasting government dollars on and why they should stop funding the arts.

That's why the first one was done by PBS, but the second and third ones were done by Showtime.

""Boring"" is not the word I would have used to describe the 1993 *Tales of the City.*"
Tales of the City,"Exactly what came into my head when he hit the screen: ""silver fox.""  And then we got another one when Victor Garber showed up.  I'm starting to wonder if all Canadian actors age this well. :)"
Tales of the City,"The original series is a classic. I watched it again recently, still love it. It holds up really well for me."
Tales of the City,I really wish Netflix had picked it up as well.
Tales of the City,They did a couple weeks ago!
Tales of the City,"Yeah, I noticed, isn't it great? Filling out [the Netflix request form](https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest) apparently works! :)"
Tales of the City,"Cool, really liked the first one."
Tales of the City,Really looking forward to this. Especially to seeing Ellen Page added to the roster. Her scenes with Laura Linney and Paul Gross are likely to be an utter hoot. 
Tales of the City,I read the first book when I was in college and it still is my favorite book that I've read from that time. I got the first series and loved that too. I can't wait for this.
Tales of the City,Happy for Murray Bartlett!! I miss *Looking* so much. 
Tales of the City,/r/talesofthecity
Tales of the City,"Any idea if ""Ani"" and ""Raven"" are actually DeeDee Halcyon's twins ""Edgar"" and ""Anna""? Or are these twins completely new characters?"
Tales of the City,"I watched it recently, it holds up really well. What a great series."
Tales of the City,"Funny. I think of it as the first **three**, since *Tales of the City* (1993), *More Tales of the City* (1998), and *Further Tales of the City* (2001) were spaced so far apart and in the US, it jumped from PBS to Showtime between ~~s2 and s3~~ s1 and s2. :)

\[edited to correct the PBS/Showtime switchover point\]"
Tales of the City,"That wouldn't be my first reaction.  It doesn't trouble you that soulless money grubbers suck the insides of a great work, and then wear its skin in order to swindle the gullible?  Are you that big a believer in Lauren Morelli?"
Tales of the City,"Damn, literally zero comments in that whole subreddit"
Tales of the City,"Was it the PBS version that had the full-frontal male nudity by D'Amico/Billy Campbell?

I remember I was utterly shocked there was full frontal nudity allowed on public broadcast television back in the 90's, ESPECIALLY on a channel such as PBS, though if it was one of the Showtime seasons, then that made a lot more sense."
Tales of the City,"If it was D'Amico as Mouse, then it would have been PBS, since he was only in the first series, and Mouse was recast with Paul Hopkins for the second and third. Billy Campbell, though, was Jon in all three.  I think I remembered blurring at the time, but my memory is faulty on stuff like this, and I was in a 75% registered Republican town at the time.  It may have been up to each local PBS station on how they wanted to handle it.

The show itself was produced by UK's Channel 4, which would explain the boundary-pushing. :D"
Tales of the City,You had me @ Laura Linney.
Tales of the City,Loved the books and the TV series when they came out. Don‚Äôt know what to expect with the revamp.
Tales of the City,"This looks great. I've never seen any of the original miniseries from the 90s/00s, but this makes me want to check them out. I love shows or movies that get revisited years later with the same cast."
Tales of the City,/r/talesofthecity
Tales of the City,That looked real cheesy and not in a good way.
Tales of the City,[removed]
Tales of the City,I‚Äôm currently watching her episode of ‚ÄúFinding Your Roots‚Äù on PBS. She is absolutely luminous! I have a girl crush on her. I so want to know her skincare routine. She‚Äôs barely wearing any makeup and looks 20 years younger than her actual age.
Tales of the City,"Do we know which books they're adapting? I've been assuming they're going to pick up with *Michael Tolliver Lives,* given that the 18-year gap between that and *Significant Others* almost exactly parallels the 17-year gap from when *Further Tales of the City* aired on Showtime."
Tales of the City,"It's really good, and available on [Acorn TV](https://smile.amazon.com/Episode-1/dp/B00GWESDRU/) right now."
Tales of the City,"I loved them.  And I remember the entire right-wing reaction that caused the show to move from PBS to Showtime between the first and second miniseries \[eyeroll\].  

What I find really weird is that *Tales* and *Further Tales* (1st and 3rd) are out on DVD, but *More Tales* is not to be found.

In lieu of finding any of those shows, though, Netflix does have a documentary on Armistead Maupin, [*The Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin*](https://www.netflix.com/title/80182949)*,* that is liberally peppered with footage from the tv adaptations."
Tales of the City,"Some of us remember watching the 1993 Channel Four miniseries on PBS, and watching Jon and ~~Mouse's~~ Beauchamp's ""meet cute"", which was completely-cheese-free anonymous bathhouse sex before they exchanged names.  And we got caught up in the lives of everyone at 28 Barbary Lane where anyone was accepted for who they were: gay, lesbian, straight, trans, queer, black, Republican, whatever.

And then we watched IRL as a mostly-Republican Congress began arguing about whether all government funding for PBS and the NEA should be cut because *this* (and Mapplethorpe) is the filth they were producing.  And PBS caved, backed down, and we had to wait five years for Showtime to pick up the baton and gives us *More Tales* and then another three years before *Further Tales.* We never did get *Babycakes, Significant Others,* or *Sure of You.*

I get that this trailer looks like Netflix is trying to do a rainbow-flagged *This is Us*, but *Tales* is something much more if you actually lived through the openly homophobic '80s and '90s.

‚Äîedited to correct faulty memory of which characters met in the bathhouse."
Tales of the City,"Fuck it, I‚Äôll engage. 

Tales of the City is a book from like 1978. And a series of books after. It talks about human things and stories among a bunch of people in a town that you seem to disapprove of. A miniseries in 1993 was made, and it looks like it‚Äôs being done again by Netflix. 

This isn‚Äôt a new story. It wasn‚Äôt created in a board room looking at metrics to figure out how ‚Äúwoke‚Äù Netflix can appear. What it is is a bigger budget show with actor name recognition and marketing, and it‚Äôs about the gay community. These are good stories, about beautiful things, about people that actually exist and lived and grew up and grew old in these communities. These people and their stories actually existed for a long time, and they don‚Äôt exist just be be ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù And their stories deserve to be told just as much as any stories about any other people and their experiences. And it‚Äôs nice to see it being done now in this age when there is a larger receptive audience and less bigoted backlash, so people who haven‚Äôt heard the stories can experience them now. It has nothing to do with being ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù"
Tales of the City,Are you *proud* of your homophobia?
Tales of the City,"*Local redditor shocked to discover that people different than him lead different lives* 

*News at 11*"
Tales of the City,"That's only the first miniseries, though.  Granted, it's the best of the three for my money."
Tales of the City,I actually just found More Tales on YouTube [on this channel.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8RqLyyBeiUurE7qj0EVT0Q/videos)
Tales of the City,That's a crazy history. Never heard of the show before. Thank you for sharing!
Tales of the City,I didn‚Äôt even know it was a remake.
Tales of the City,Well said!
Tales of the City,"Yes and yes. I keep hoping for a wider release prior to the reboot hitting Netflix, but idk... Let alone a remaster, which would be amazing"
Tales of the City,"I don't think it is a remake. I think it's something new. It's about adapting the books.

[Armistead Maupin wrote nine of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_City) from 1978 *(Tales of the City)* until 2014 *(The Days of Anna Madrigal).* And when he first started writing them it was as a newspaper serial: as daily installments in *The San Francisco Chronicle.* Every day, you'd get a new chapter on what the characters were up to. The first five volumes were written this way; from *Sure of You* on, though, they were written as full novels.

But the books are set when they were written.

Given the huge gap and time leap, and the fact that many of the same actors are coming back to reprise their roles 17 years later, I have a feeling we're not going back to the '70s to start all over again with [Mary Anne Singleton's mood ring turning blue](https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Tales-of-the-City-May-24-1976-2370971.php). :)  Ellen Page being cast as an adult Shawna (Shawna is Mary Anne's daughter) and all the updating for today's San Francisco means they're probably starting at or after book 7, *Michael Tolliver Lives,* a book that didn't exist when the first television adaptation happened."
Tales of the City,"Oh okay, I still don‚Äôt think it looks good but it makes sense why people are so passionate about it. I‚Äôll give it a shot, thanks for the info"
Tales of the City,"Hey, no worries if it's not your thing and thanks for keeping an open mind. For me, I think of a show like *Pose* as a direct descendant."
Tales of the City,I know its a bit objectifying but as a bisexual women i am probably gonna watch it all just because i think ellen page is perfect
Tales of the City,Super cute. I didn‚Äôt really get the story from the trailer but it did leave me smiling.
Tales of the City,"So, do I have to see the other 3 seasons in order to get this?"
Tales of the City,I'm so excited for this! I do wish they'd get the rights to the other two parts of the story. I would love to binge them all together as it has been ages since I've seen them.
Tales of the City,"Wow, this looks great!"
Tales of the City,Pass.
Tales of the City,"To certain extent it may be classed as objectifying but it's a fact that Ellen Page is pretty damn perfect.

It's also nice to see a super successful LGBT woman in leading roles. She was amazing in Umbrella academy."
Tales of the City,"I don't think so.  The first three are based on the first three Armistead Maupin books: *Tales of the City, More Tales of the City,* and *Further Tales of the City.* But we never got *Significant Others, Babyckes,* or *Sure of You.*

The first three ""seasons"" were done very long ago and far apart (1993 \[PBS\], 1998 \[Showtime\], and 2001 \[Showtime\]). It wasn't really a series, more a group of miniseries.

Given that Shawna is an adult (being played by Ellen Page), I have a feeling they're adapting material from the three most recent books, which were published about 18 years after the previous six: *Michael Tolliver Lives!, Mary Ann in Autumn,* and *The Days of Anna Madrigal.*

I think it would probably be okay to just jump in on the Netflix one, and if you find you want backstory on the characters, then go and find the books/or earlier tv adaptations. But you don't need to have watched them to get that this is a ""logical"" family (vs. a biological one) that includes gay, straight, and transgendered folks living at 28 Barbary Lane in San Francisco."
Tales of the City,I wouldn't say you have to watch the older seasons but if you're interested you don't have to go visiting shady pirate sites. It's my understanding that most of the episodes can be found between YouTube & [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com).
Tales of the City,"Just me, but I don't think this is a remake of *Tales of the City.* I think they're doing the newer books, given that Shawna's an adult; she's not even born until *Babycakes* (book 4)*.* 

There are, btw, [nine books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_City), not just three. :D"
Tales of the City,And you're telling me that airbrushed to hell photo is Molly Ringwald?
Tales of the City,As a fan of the original PBS series I am excited to see where these characters have ended up. They are bringing back Laura Linney and each new cast announcement is more intriguing than the last. Here's to hoping they can get some of the great character actors who rounded out the previous cast to come back. 
Tales of the City,I saw Laura Linney filming a block from me earlier this week!
Tales of the City,I‚Äôm intrigued. Hope it‚Äôs good! 
Tales of the City,Wonder if they'll bring back Thomas Gibson as Beauchamp.
Tales of the City,"Seriously. She's 50 years old and she has aged really well, but depicting her as a 20 something is doing a disservice to everyone."
Tales of the City,Doubtful since he died in More Tales.
Tales of the City,"Like Alfre Woodard in Luke Cage. I mean go her for being 60 plus landing the role of a 40 something, but I never could buy it. She walked and moved like a 60 something and it was more than just a little offputting when she's there tonguing a 30 yr old.

I'm like ""Can we get back to the story please?"""
Tales of the City,"Theo Rossi is 43, not sure what age his character is supposed to be though "
Tales of the City,Same age
Tales of the City,I watched the first installment of *Tales of the City* recently (it's streaming on Acorn TV). Man does it hold up. What a great series.... And so glad Paul Gross is back for this.
Tales of the City,i am grinning from ear to ear at this news.  the *tales of the city* book series is one of my favorites and i loved the tv adaptations as well.  cannot wait for this!
Tales of the City,"I was OBSESSED with Paul Gross as a teenager, man he was everywhere during the Due South days.  I went out and spent a lot of money on video tapes of all his previous work. Only watched TOTC because he was in it, and loved it! There was a sequel wasn‚Äôt there? "
Tales of the City,"Love that dude. Due South is an awesome show, at least the first 2 seasons."
Tales of the City,"For me, *Slings and Arrows* was even better.  He could also make an ""eh"" show watchable *(Eastwick).*  And yeah it's nice not to have *too* many faces replaced.  We just can't seem to hang onto anyone for Mouse... :)"
Tales of the City,"*Slings & Arrows* doesn't get brought up enough around here, or in those lists of the most underrated shows of all-time. Phenomenal series."
Tales of the City,">Based on the books by Armistead Maupin, this next chapter ‚Äì *Armistead Maupin‚Äôs Tales of the City* ‚Äì follows Mary Ann (Laura Linney), who returns home to San Francisco and is reunited with her daughter Shawna (Ellen Page) and ex-husband Brian (Paul Gross), twenty years after leaving them behind to pursue her career. Fleeing the midlife crisis that her picture perfect Connecticut life created, Mary Ann returns to her chosen family and will quickly be drawn back into the orbit of Anna Madrigal (Olympia Dukakis) and the residents of 28 Barbary Lane.

>**Mamet will recur as Claire Duncan, a driven documentarian who has a burgeoning relationship with Shawna (Page) that catches them both off guard.**"
Tales of the City,"I didn't realize this was a continuation of the PBS original! It was kind of cheesy but I fucking adored it. Lots of goofy characters played by so many interesting performers; Mary Kay Place, Parker Posey, Ian Mckellan, Sandro Oh, Bruce McCulloch, Jeanene Garofolo just to name a few. I hope some of them come back. "
Tales of the City,"two of my favorite things, so i'm excited about this news"
The Chef Show,I love that he's just churning out episodes of this. He gives the people what we want.
The Chef Show,"This show isn‚Äôt anything incredible, but it‚Äôs just so *nice*. They started it because Jon wanted to hang out and cook with Chef Roy after they finished the movie *Chef* and it really does have the feel of two friends hanging out and talking to interesting people. It also helps that the production value is great and that the food always looks amazing."
The Chef Show,"My favorite thing about this show is that the cooking is real. Roy Choi fucks up in the show, not everything is perfect, they burn stuff. Most cooking shows everything is cooked perfectly and perfectly seasoned each and every time but realistically even the most experienced cooks will mess up time to time"
The Chef Show,[deleted]
The Chef Show,My name chef
The Chef Show,I love the lil stop motion animation that shows up before each recipe
The Chef Show,The Chef show was when I first realized I didn't like  Gwyneth Paltrow.
The Chef Show,"I love this purely because of how nice Roy Choi is; genuinely likes handing out with his friend and is SO FUCKING PROUD of how Jon has learned. 

&#x200B;

The gentle coaching and information that Roy does is amazing; I love when people truly love what they do"
The Chef Show,Anyone who created Elf and Baby Yoda will have my allegiance forever.
The Chef Show,"You might like ‚ÄúSomebody Feed Phil‚Äù or ‚ÄúMidnight Diner, Tokyo Stories‚Äù. 

Phil always ends with a Skype to his parents and the whole show premise is wholesome and entertaining. In my opinion."
The Chef Show,"Jon Favreau's resum√© blows my mind.  In my opinion, I think he single handedly brought about the Marvel renaissance with the first Iron Man movie.  Not only did he direct, he starred in it as a damn driver.  Not only that turns out he's responsible for The Mandalorian!  You know what else?  He was Monica's millionaire boyfriend on Friends!"
The Chef Show,"Just finished the first new episode, Wolfgang Puck.

Still a great super fun food show."
The Chef Show,Jon Favreau is low key the best guy working in Hollywood right now. He's pretty good as a fun fat guy who has more jokes than just his weight
The Chef Show,"This, Ugly Delicious, and The Last Table are 3 of our favorite food/cooking shows.

Can't wait for more!"
The Chef Show,I'm amazed at everything Jon Favreau Is doing. Like howthefuck does he do it all?
The Chef Show,This first 20 mins of Wolfgang watching Jon cooking an omelette is giving me anxiety
The Chef Show,I love watching this while I eat. 10-20 min spurts. It‚Äôs wholesome. Except the Goop episode. Fuck that bitch
The Chef Show,"Honestly, how does Favreau have the time? Between directing, showing up in the MCU, showrunning *The Mandalorian*, and still being awesome in *The Chef Show* -- just one of those jobs would completely slay me and yet he did all four (and more) last year."
The Chef Show,"pretty good show, calling it one of netflix's best is a stretch though. A bit irregular with the episode quality."
The Chef Show,"I‚Äôve requested on Twitter that they make a cookbook. So let‚Äôs see how that goes...

The exploded view ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù would work well on a page. With some technique discussion. And Jon/Roy/Guest could do some text on first time they made it or other related story."
The Chef Show,"Where‚Äôs the Sequel to the masterpiece Chef (2014)

Favreau we‚Äôre all waiting"
The Chef Show,"Oh man this is good news.  It's such a lovely show to watch.  As other people noticed, some episodes are better than others.  But it's relaxing and charming, and surprisingly rewatachable.  Plus, it gives a great insight into the work that goes into the industry and has given me some damn good recipes!"
The Chef Show,Didn't know this existed till now. Good job Netflix UI.
The Chef Show,OMG fuck yes! Thank you for this post. There goes my entire Friday night. I love to home chef and I love trying all the recipes they make. It‚Äôs so fun and I would never get tired of watching those to cook delicious food!
The Chef Show,I wish he'd bring back Dinner for Five
The Chef Show,"How on earth does Jon Favreau find the time to do all the shit he does, it‚Äôs seriously impressive"
The Chef Show,"It‚Äôs like Jon Favreu got his YouTube channel sponsored and paid by Netflix, so he can do whatever he wants to it, besides needing to ask to ‚ÄúLike and Subscribe‚Äù at the end of it.
Smarttttt"
The Chef Show,Idk man I honestly didn‚Äôt really like the show and I don‚Äôt know that there were a ton of people clamoring for a new season. Watched the grilled cheese episode people rave about. Felt like the production quality was amateurish and Favreau‚Äôs presence kind of distracted from the food / chef throughout the show. Just didn‚Äôt give the chef and their work the proper due I felt they deserved. Was really hoping to like it too but left pretty unsatisfied.
The Chef Show,Does it get better?  I got halfway through the first episode with Paltrow and couldn't deal with seeing her.
The Chef Show,Downloading this shit in an airport right before a 2hr flight. Perfect timing.
The Chef Show,I love this man he can do no wrong he's restored my faith in Star wars.
The Chef Show,I am thus intrigued.
The Chef Show,Wait what?! Season 3 is out now? *Dashes to Netflix*
The Chef Show,"First season was great. It felt like they made things that were at least feasible to make at home and everything seemed really tasty. It tipped me over the edge to buy a Vitamix which I‚Äôve been eyeballing for years. 

Seond season... I dunno. It felt like they strayed a bit from the cooking. I do know I will never get a chance to harvest oysters."
The Chef Show,I don't understand how this show is so popular. It's literally Favreau showing off his celebrity friends with a side of cooking show...that isn't even good as a cooking show. The production is really sloppy and the focus on food is minimal at best. Favreau just shuffles around the kitchen not really knowing what he's doing and getting in the way of the actual chefs.
The Chef Show,Sounds like an ad
The Chef Show,"Netflix has generally gone to shit, but this was one of the few (mostly) propaganda-free, decent shows they brought on recently. And yes, Favreau is largely responsible."
The Chef Show,"*Jon Favreau is a warlock*

Give me a fucking break. All this guy does is peddle the most average of average content to the masses, and gets showered with endless praise."
The Chef Show,Great show. My wife and I have been enjoying this over the last few weeks. We really appreciate how down to earth Jon and Roy are and how they make food that people actually want to eat. Much more interesting than competition shows where chefs are making bizarre dishes and throwing around obscure jargon. (Obscure for us regular people anyway.)
The Chef Show,"Already binged the whole volume, seriously love this show. It‚Äôs like cooking with your friends when you‚Äôre both trying new stuff out. Can‚Äôt get enough of it lol"
The Chef Show,"Love this show, def one of Netflix best."
The Chef Show,I just wish they give out the recipe they are cooking with. So that I can atleast try it at home
The Chef Show,"I never had grilled cheese in my life until I watched this show. I made it exactly as they did and it's one of my favorite things ever.

It's so much fun to watch."
The Chef Show,Just got dropped within the last day/hours.
The Chef Show,The ep with Wolfgang Puck is just really nice and endearing
The Chef Show,I look forward to more of Jon getting gentley owned by his badass chef friends for flipping bacon too much
The Chef Show,"jesus what a puff piece

it's a decent cooking show with some good (burr) and bad (paltrow, chang) guests, Favreau definitely has chops in the kitchen though"
The Chef Show,Jon Favreau is so god damn cool
The Chef Show,"This is far and away my favorite cooking show because despite all the great personalities, in the end it's about executing really high quality food. Contrast that to David Chang's plethora of new cooking/travel shows that feel much more about the interviews than cooking.

Chef Roy doesn't compromise or cut corners for the camera and makes it all look easy. Definitely has inspired me to step up my game in the kitchen."
The Chef Show,Happy!
The Chef Show,Curiosity Show. Fucking loved those cunts.
The Chef Show,"I like it, but did not appreciate how they were with my boi babish."
The Chef Show,Hmm.  Have not watched this yet. Will add to queue. Thanks!
The Chef Show,It influenced Binging with Babish so I'm good with it
The Chef Show,I have worked in kitchens and never really found cooking shows all that appealing. This though is my ideal show. It‚Äôs just people hanging out making food and talking shit. It‚Äôs great.
The Chef Show,"This show is so good! It honestly doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense episode to episode, but that‚Äôs part of its charm. It‚Äôs basically just two dudes who are genuinely interested in and excited about food. It‚Äôs charm is also helped by the fact that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúlovable and curious step-dad trying to become more interested in the passions of his hype beast Asian son.‚Äù"
The Chef Show,"I don‚Äôt know why I love this show, but I love this show."
The Chef Show,I freakin love this show dude. It‚Äôs one of my favorite shows of recent years.
The Chef Show,HAVE YOU SEEN CHEF?!??
The Chef Show,I absolutely love the series and I have binge watched it all ü§ì
The Chef Show,cHeF
The Chef Show,I love how not pretentious the show is. One of my favorite cooking shows now.
The Chef Show,So he gets a red seal from this show?
The Chef Show,"Jon Favreau knows what I want.  

He's like a big bear, man; he's got these teeth and these fucking claws and he doesn't know how to kill the bunny...

He's so fuckin money, and he doesn't even know it."
The Chef Show,"I think my favorite part of the show was when some of the guests were fanboying over jf he quickly puts them in their place by asking them ""how can I help chef"" he's there to learn. from them. i love the curiosity I love the humility I love the passion."
The Chef Show,3? 2 already came out?!
The Chef Show,Hate this fat fuck
The Chef Show,"i'd like to see more of  the ""the final table"" tv show. i think that show is by far the best cooking show ever."
The Chef Show,Fuckin‚Äô New Zealand Netflix.
The Chef Show,Random thought but about halfway through episode 3 it dawned on me just how fucking huge Jons head is. Like holy shit he's got a huge fuckin mug on him.
The Chef Show,L o l I literally just pressed play on the 3rd season...
The Chef Show,This man is a national treasure
The Chef Show,"Haven‚Äôt seen it so I can‚Äôt comment on any quality of things, but I remember Jon Favesu saying that he didn‚Äôt know shit about cooking before the filming Chef, but fell in love with it during his training for scenes. Hope I have some time to check it out soon."

The Chef Show,"i'm a bit surprised that the regular tv shows invaded netflix. i hoped it could remain a home for only movies and series, insted now it's filled with what i left back when i stopped watching television, so sad people enjoy these kitchen/trade/whatever/cars/babes/ugly-shit tv shows, it really shows how we feel alone. Why would you spend time watching people talking and cooking otherwise?"

The Chef Show,"Never really watched cooking shows, but something about Jon Favreau and Roy just make them really watchable. I guess it's because of the candidness with their cooking since sometimes they mess up along with Jon genuinely be interested in learning from other people. 

I watched the first episode of volume 3 last night, and Favreau was sweating over getting the omlete for Wolfgung Puck just right."
The Chef Show,Is this a good series? Please let me know
The Chef Show,The Roy Choi centric episode at best friend made me realize it was a whole restaurant. We went by it several times last year and thought it was just a weird bar and not knowing the whole other side to it. Ughh gotta go back now

The Chef Show,I wanted to watch this show but when I turned it on and literally his _first guest_ was Gweneth Paltro making Goop dishes I was out.  I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing.  It felt like I was watching a Goop ad.  Does the show get better than this? Is it worth continuing?
The Chef Show,"Loving this series, they have great chemistry. Does anyone know who is doing the miniature food title cards? It‚Äôs so creative and cool each time they compile a recipe."
The Chef Show,Does anyone know who did the music for the show? I love the funk/hip hop vibe some of the songs have but am having a hell of a time finding anything - or even similar songs for that matter.
The Chef Show,Does anyone have an idea when the mandalorian will guest in this show? Maybe cook some frogs for our little baby yoda
The Chef Show,It's so fucking good.

Arthdal Chronicles,"> despite the Handmaids Tale not even being sci-fi at all

I'm pretty sure that it is. It's dystopian sci-fi. 

But anyways back to the point, a TV version of RYM wouldn't really be ideal because... well, TV and music are like... different things. TV shows don't run that deep... it's either you can find 10+ shows that are similar or you can't find any at all. 

Plus an algorithm wouldn't be able to pin point what exactly one is looking for in shows the same way they do music, because there will be certain aspects of tv shows that will be subjective. Like, do you want your sci-fi with relationship drama or no? Some do, some don't. 

Then there's the issue of quality, just because you find a series that's similar... doesn't mean you'll find it to be good. Movies are a different story but really it's always just best to not try to seek out shows similar to one you like anyways."
Arthdal Chronicles,"That's because the whole subgenre thing is fart sniffing snob wankery used by a tiny fraction of obsessives and society at large doesn't give two shits beyond ""Hey, it's a comedy!""."
Arthdal Chronicles,"""Dramas"" are a big genre.. like Jazz

&#x200B;

Jazz is broken down into styles/time periods.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz)

&#x200B;

""Dramas"" are broken down into **tropes**.

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaTropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaTropes)

but a trope is usually plot/story specific:

&#x200B;

example - ""always save the girl""

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl)

The hero makes it plain that they value the life of their Love Interest over those of everyone else: friends, family, True Companions, strangers, even all other life in the universe. It can come about as the result of a Sadistic Choice, only having enough time to rescue one person out of several, a case of The Dulcinea Effect, or whatever other requirements the plot puts in their way and plainly making a decision.  


>Babylon Berlin and the basic reason why is because you cannot filter by ""High Fantasy"" or ""Neo-Noir"" (Babylon Berlin isn't even tagged as Noir on IMDB).

how many ***tropes*** are used in that show? TONS

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonBerlin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonBerlin)

regarding ""noir""

&#x200B;

Fantastic Noir

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNoir](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticNoir)

A sister trope of ""neo noir"" or cyberpunk, fantastic noir is a relatively small subgenre that blends the setting, characters (it usually stars a Hardboiled Detective who sometimes doubles as an Occult Detective), and plot structure of a Film Noir mystery story with the more colorful elements of fantasy and Science Fiction.

&#x200B;

Sunshine Noir

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunshineNoir](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunshineNoir)

Sunshine Noir combines elements of Shining City and City Noir. The setting may be a Crapsaccharine World that looks a glamorous and glitzy place but it's filled with gangsters, drug deals gone wrong, undercover police officers, criminal drifters, violent youths; you name it. However, the setting does not necessarily look like a Crapsaccharine World.

&#x200B;

Future Noir

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFutureIsNoir](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFutureIsNoir)

One thing that we know for certain about the future and of alien species waiting for us out in the universe: None of them have discovered the usefulness of adequate lighting. And in some cases, humans have forgotten it.

&#x200B;

Nordic Noir

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NordicNoir](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NordicNoir)

Nordic Noir or Scandinavian Noir is a genre of Crime Fiction from the Scandinavian countries, which broke through around the Turn of the Millennium and since.

&#x200B;

""Fantasy""...? even more ""subgenres"" 

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fantasy)

&#x200B;

>but there's no site or service that really organises them by calling on the wisdom of the watching audience.

they list a lot of examples.. per trope.

&#x200B;

not just movies and tv, either.. books, comics, games.. 

[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalThriller](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalThriller)

A subgenre of Thriller, Psychological Thrillers also focus on giving thrills to the audience. But while a regular Thriller is usually based on action and a tightly-woven storyline, a Psychological Thriller is centered around the characters, their thoughts, their motivations, and their behavior."
Arthdal Chronicles,"I mean, subgenres have been around since before the video stores died, so I'm not really sure what you're talking about when you say ""subgenre revolution.""

Personally, I don't need to sort the things I enjoy into categories. I find new music/film/television by paying attention to news sites, exploring the influences of creators/critics I respect, and talking to real life friends or other nerds online.  By this point in my life, I have a pretty clear idea of what's going to float my boat artistically, so it's not hard hard to pick and choose what's worth consuming.

Genres and subgenres are useful for sorting shit out in a streaming service, but it's a waste of time to overthink it. They don't really help us understand art on any substantive level.  If you get too pissy about the particulars, you end up spending all your time explaining your filing system.

That being said, I wish there was a solid TV rating/discussion app.  Something classy like LetterboxD with things sorted out into episodes/seasons.  Or maybe LetterboxD should just add a proper TV section."
Arthdal Chronicles,"So I see this is being downvoted (declining more and more in the % on the side).... I have no idea why. If you don't want to interact in this thread, just don't...? Why does it affect you?"
Arthdal Chronicles,"Babylon Berlin has 20,000 people rating it on Imdb. IMDB has a larger audience than RYM. You would only need the consensus of 100 of them to steer an accurate answer in terms of reference to the scope of the tags.

Also, regarding trailers - I would have to have been aware of Babylon Berlin to see it. I wasn't aware of it because TV sites are bad when it comes to this, as outlined in my OP. If I could filter by specific terminology I'm inclined towards, ie - Neo-Noir or even just ""Noir"" - I'd have discovered Babylon Berlin years ago."
Arthdal Chronicles,">I'm pretty sure that it is. It's dystopian sci-fi.

Dystopian isn't sci-fi. That's a common mistake people make. It can be, but it isn't in itself rooted in science fiction. There are no science fiction elements in Handmaids Tale. SS-GB is also Dystopian but it's not sci-fi. 

Same goes with Post-Apocalyptic which is constantly given ""Sci-Fi"" on IMDB when it... isn't, in many cases.

>But anyways back to the point, a TV version of RYM wouldn't really be ideal because... well, TV and music are like... different things. TV shows don't run that deep... it's either you can find 10+ shows that are similar or you can't find any at all.

In many cases, this is just not true. Especially if you filter by Crime and Drama, where there are hundreds of releases every year.

>Plus an algorithm wouldn't be able to pin point what exactly one is looking for in shows the same way they do music, because there will be certain aspects of tv shows that will be subjective. Like, do you want your sci-fi with relationship drama or no? Some do, some don't.

This wouldn't be an algorithm. It would be voted on by the larger community - just like RYM - and dual tags could exist. A Near-Future sci-fi + Relationship Drama is quite conceivable.

>Then there's the issue of quality, just because you find a series that's similar... doesn't mean you'll find it to be good. Movies are a different story but really it's always just best to not try to seek out shows similar to one you like anyways.

Sure, I agree, you may not like it (and this is where user-ratings are useful) - but if it's in a field you do like, that makes it much easier."
Arthdal Chronicles,Why has it been very useful for music fans then? Why does it continue to work for me in finding new music I like?
Arthdal Chronicles,">""Dramas"" are a big genre.. like Jazz

Indeed.

>but a trope is usually plot/story specific:

Not all tropes would also be characterised as genres. And tvtropes is of limited use for two reasons.

1. A page doesn't necessarily have all examples of series. There's no entry for Paris Police 1900, for example, on the ""Film Noir"" page because the people editing it simply don't know it exists.

2. The information is not crowdsourced via a voting system. It's just whoever edits it. Some of the examples aren't particularly accurate on many pages because of this.

TVTropes is useful but it's not remotely a complete database here at all."
Arthdal Chronicles,">I mean, subgenres have been around since before the video stores died, so I'm not really sure what you're talking about when you say ""subgenre revolution.""

Yes, they have - but they were never used in the way they are now by people to find music, and so easily. Record stores used generalised categories somewhat like IMDB does now. ""Urban"", ""Alternative"", ""Rock"", ""Pop"", ""Jazz"" etc.

>I don't need to sort the things I enjoy into categories. I find new music/film/television by paying attention to news sites, exploring the influences of creators/critics I respect, and talking to real life friends or other nerds online. By this point in my life, I have a pretty clear idea of what's going to float my boat artistically, so it's not hard hard to pick and choose what's worth consuming.

Sure, you can read a synopsis or a trailer and identify whether or not a show is of interest to you. But *you have to know that the show exists first*. Smaller or medium-sized shows like Babylon Berlin and Arthdal Chronicles are off most people's radars. They would conceivably like either, but they are simply unaware of them. 

This is the same for albums - I have to know the album exists before I can try it out. Music sites, however, have an abundance of subgenre terms commonly used across the stylistic spectrum that people (and bands themselves) categorise. So I'm much more likely to not miss out on stuff inclined to my interests.

This is where a useful tagging system would work wonders. I'd have discovered Arthdal Chronicles some time ago just by filtering ""High Fantasy"" on a TV cataloging website."
Arthdal Chronicles,"Just for starters, I felt you were doing some really pedantic hairsplitting, plus the above comment and the presumptuousness of phrases like ""faulty wisdom"" don't encourage me that you're going to take disagreement well. 

You seem to have already made up your mind and dismissed contrary opinions as objectively wrong, on a topic that sounds very subjective to me. Not much point in engaging with that, which sounds like a fine reason to downvote a post. Debating the ""correct"" boundaries between genres doesn't seem like an interesting topic to me, especially when I feel likely to just be told I'm wrong.

Not really interested in discussing it further, sorry. But you did ask."
Arthdal Chronicles,"I agree, the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale is not science fiction, I would say it‚Äôs speculative fiction, as its core premise is a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù type of story, without any scientific basis for the concept (which science fiction would require‚Ä¶ it would need to be based off of a scientific conceit or work mainly off of fictional scientific advancements - already a very broad term, because arguably a lot of stories categorized as science fiction barely have anything to do with science, they just happen to be set in space)."
Arthdal Chronicles,"Just for reference, the author has always maintained Handmaiden is speculative fiction, not sci fi, but since it‚Äôs release, it‚Äôs always been lumped into sci fi, embraced by the sci fi audience, recurved sci fi awards, and she‚Äôs not really cared to push back, even though she says it‚Äôs speculative fiction. 

It‚Äôs one of those grey areas that this is sorta on the edge of sci fi, there just wasn‚Äôt a good category for it so it got lumped into there. People have been debating this since it‚Äôs release"
Arthdal Chronicles,"I really don't get why everybody here is so aggressive towards your idea (in a subreddit for tv show snobs/obsessives). I think it would be neat to have some kind of subgenre tag pool to use the hivemind of snobs/obsessives (my people) to answer questions like ""what other shows or movies are similar to this one i liked"". ""Society at large"" can still go see any crap with a comedy tag if they want."
Arthdal Chronicles,">Yes, they have - but they were never used in the way they are now by people to find music, and so easily. Record stores used generalised categories somewhat like IMDB does now. ""Urban"", ""Alternative"", ""Rock"", ""Pop"", ""Jazz"" etc.

I mean, the way we find new art has changed, because streaming/online retail exists. Genre classifications are more specific on sites like IMDB, but fundamentally it's not any different from how Blockbuster sorted out new movies.  The revolution is the medium, not the filing system.

>But you have to know that the show exists first. Smaller or medium-sized shows like Babylon Berlin and Arthdal Chronicles are off most people's radars. They would conceivably like either, but they are simply unaware of them.

Once again... you find out about shows existing by paying attention to the culture - news, critics, talking to other fans IRL and on social media. A robust tagging system is nice and I'm glad it works for you, but I don't think it's as fundamental to ways people consume art as you think."
Arthdal Chronicles,"You have misunderstood. This isn't about me personally dictating specific categories for shows. This is less about what specifically goes where and more that no tv service even makes any distinction at all, which, as I I argue is unhelpful.

The comment about Dystopian fictions specific placement is not really the main focus of this thread. IMDB and TVDB don't even have that as a category at all."
Arthdal Chronicles,"Well anything set in space is still playing with the idea of technology we don't currently have or understand being the norm, so even if it's very soft sci-fi, it's still fair enough to put it under it. There's precisely zero of that in Handmaid's Tale.

And yeah, Handmaids Tale is speculative fiction, for sure."
Arthdal Chronicles,"In IMDB terms, ""Drama"" and ""Thriller"" is sufficient. It's not as if there is no tag at all on there other than Sci-Fi for it. Mr. Robot is also embraced by sci-fi audience but it isn't sci-fi, nor is it tagged as such."
Arthdal Chronicles,"Beats me. I wanted to have a decent discussion on it, not ""how dare you say dystopian isn't sci-fi"" or ""stop having an opinion"" type response. People getting awfully offended about where I categorise Dystopian fiction when it isn't even a tag anywhere anyway.

I mean the core idea is that these are subgenres of the basic broader genres, so the basic 'Comedy' or 'Sci-Fi' or 'Fantasy' tags would still exist, so anyone who thinks subgenres are useless could just ignore them."
Arthdal Chronicles,">I mean, the way we find new art has changed, because streaming/online retail exists. Genre classifications are more specific on sites like IMDB, but fundamentally it's not any different from how Blockbuster sorted out new movies. The revolution is the medium, not the filing system.

IMDB isn't specific at all. That was my point. ""Action"", ""Drama"", ""Thriller"", ""Fantasy"" are the ""Alternative"" and ""Indie"" of the movie/TV world.

>Once again... you find out about shows existing by paying attention to the culture - news, critics

Neither Babylon Berlin or especially Arthdal Chronicles has any international footprint whatsoever. Almost no-one talks about them or reviews them.

>A robust tagging system is nice and I'm glad it works for you, but I don't think it's as fundamental to ways people consume art as you think.

Sure, but most people aren't especially bothered that they might miss something and mostly only notice really popular stuff trending on Netflix/HBO/Amazon or whatever it may be."
Arthdal Chronicles,"You... you started by telling me I merely misunderstood you-- silly me-- *and* you ignored my request not to continue this conversation. I feel this, plus your general air of defensiveness, does not substantially contradict my original point.

Moving on, have a good day."
Arthdal Chronicles,"I agree, but I also think there is some validity to the argument that just being set in space doesn‚Äôt mean it holds any scientific basis. Like you said, that‚Äôs the distinction between hard and soft sci-fi. Personally don‚Äôt care as long as the story is good."
Arthdal Chronicles,"You do know Handmaiden is almost 40 years old right‚Ä¶ this has been debated since the 80s if its sci fi or not, but for practical purposes, it‚Äôs almost always lumped into sci fi."
Arthdal Chronicles,I have every right to reply to people in an open forum if I feel misrepresented. Whether you choose to continue is up to you.
Arthdal Chronicles,"That's only because anything ""Dystopian"" is lumped in with sci-fi."
Arthdal Chronicles,I‚Äôm sure you can debate that with the other 50M people over the last 40 years.
Arthdal Chronicles,In any case the broader point is that it's miles away from Farscape and there's no way to filter by tag to distinguish them on IMDB or other services sci-fi or not
Leaving Neverland,"How creepy are those faxes though

Leaving Neverland,Anyone notice how James Safechuck kept speaking about his past talking about himself generally as a ‚Äúyou‚Äù as opposed to saying ‚ÄúI‚Äù? As if the trauma was so bad he needs to distant himself to recount it. Man this doc makes me queasy. 
Leaving Neverland,"This thread is kind of interesting because it‚Äôs clearly full of people who were too young to remember the late 80s and early 90s, and just don‚Äôt get how this could have happened. They don‚Äôt understand a world where people didn‚Äôt assume everyone might be a pedophile, and they don‚Äôt understand that MJ was beyond a superstar. 

Judging these moms and saying you‚Äôd have never fallen for it is not impressive when you‚Äôve just watched a 2-4 hour documentary about it 30 years after the fact. It doesn‚Äôt make you savvy or street smart. There was a televised court case in the early 90s, and everyone knew how weird Michael Jackson was, and how much time he spent with kids, and still no one in America was really sure. The common refrain at the time was that because he grew up as a child star, he didn‚Äôt get to have a childhood, so maybe he was just trying to relive it. Only now is it clear that it was probably true, that he really did do these things. And it‚Äôs shocking and terrible and of course everyone wishes someone would have stopped it. But to suggest the moms are idiots who should have known the world‚Äôs biggest celebrity was molesting their kids demonstrates a total lack of understanding of the context "

Leaving Neverland,How the fuck did he just always have different boys around him? Did people realize it at the time? Did everyone think it was weird as fuck? I‚Äôm too young to remember. I don‚Äôt get how it was so open
Leaving Neverland,"It's crazy that I ever bought into this horse shit narrative that Jackson was an insane dude who saw himself as a kid. I think that South Park episode, without intending to, helped Jackson more than it hurt him. It sold that narrative as well.

The truth according to this doc is that he was a cold and calculating predator who knew exactly what he was doing with the persona he cultivated and was far more self aware than any of us ever realized. "
Leaving Neverland,"Everything described could only have happened with the assistance of others who absolutely must have known what was going on.

Leaving Neverland,Even if you omit all the allegations of sexual assault you have to admit that it is fucked up for a 30 year old man to hang out with kids that aren't his own. Even MJ supporters have to admit that. Now if you include the allegations of sexual assault you have to admit that when there is smoke there is fire and in this case there is a shit ton of smoke. Michael Jackson does not come out of this looking good in fact he looks like a sexual predator. I just wish he was alive so these claims could be investigated properly similar to what happened after that R. Kelly doc was released.
Leaving Neverland,WHY DID THESE PEOPLE LET THEIR KIDS SLEEP IN A ROOM WITH A GROWN MAN THAT HAS A GODDAMN AMUSEMENT PARK. My childhood was a lie.
Leaving Neverland,"Some of this has more to do with part 2, but here are some of my thoughts. Wade‚Äôs mother doesn‚Äôt want to hear what she allowed Michael to do to her son because it would give her nightmares. I guess she doesn‚Äôt want to tarnish those memories of the good times she had in the grand canyon with the rest of her family while she left her 7 year old son with what is essentially a stranger. Both of these women knew what they were doing, in my opinion, whether they are willing to admit it or not. Wade‚Äôs mother in particular was willing to destroy her entire family chasing a fantasy. And the other mother, don‚Äôt tell me you were dancing when Michael died in 2009, when your son didn‚Äôt come out with his story until years later. You knew."
Leaving Neverland,I have to give major credit to both Wade & James for standing up & facing the Jackson Estate Train and not backing down.  That really takes guts & perseverance.  I wish nothing but peace to these men & their families.  They tackled their monster as best they could & when they could.  
Leaving Neverland,Is it coincidence each one of Michael Jackson's 'sleepovers' with boys just happened to be sleepovers with physically beautiful boys? I don't think so.
Leaving Neverland,"I won't make any claims one way or another, however, we as a society need be comfortable with the idea of extreme scrutiny of our idols, to blindly idolize someone is wrong no matter what. "

Leaving Neverland,"
I found Jimmy Safechuck's story of his abuse to be believable. Wade I'm not so sure about but what Michael did to his family was cuntish.

It was clear he was grooming kids, it was summed up towards the end when she said he moved to another boy and family after 12 months. I'm sure at times he was unsuccessful or lost patience with other boys, hence why they deny the claims. The fact he was best friends with boys, slept with them, told them over and over that he loved them then cast them to the side makes him a monster. Even if he never sexually abused the children he abused them mentally."

But James didn't come out with his abuse story until 2013....so did his mom already believe MJ to be a pedophile before her son told he was abused? I am just wondering if I missed something with the timeline during that section. Part 2 BTW.
Leaving Neverland,"When I was in elementary school, my charismatic, good-looking, talented, fun-loving, young male teacher sexually molested several of the boys in my class. He did this in front of everyone on a semi-regular basis. This was the 80s and we were young kids, but we weren't naive enough to know that it was wrong. We knew it was and yet every one of us in that classroom craved his attention because when you were favored, nobody in the world could make you feel more talented, beautiful, and special. I can understand how the men might look back on their time with MJ and feel conflicted. I know I do. On the one hand I am sometimes reminded of what happened in my classroom and I literally want to vomit. There's a song my teacher used to sing in front of the class and hearing it on the radio now sends me into a cold sweat. And of course it's one of those songs you hear all the damn time.) And yet, sometimes, I'm able to look back on the ""good"" things he did and actually smile. I hate the man with the anger of a thousand boiling lobsters and yet he's the one who really taught me to write. He helped develop my love of singing. The boys who were abused by my teacher have the same feelings. The thing about these kinds of abusers is that when they're abusive, they're horrible. When they're not abusing you, though, they're magnificent. It's complicated. And hell, it's one of the reasons why they're able to pull it off for so long. "
Leaving Neverland,That's gonna be a yikes from me dawg
Leaving Neverland,"When Pedo-Pan spoke using an Australian accent it made my skin crawl. I am still at a loss for words after part 2. The fax messages, the nicknames, that damn lullaby ""anyone seen my little one"".. he didn't have red flags he WAS the red flag waving in front of our faces with that damn red shirt. "
Leaving Neverland,"My brother was molested by our uncle when he was a kid, and he was getting visibly worked up watching this. He has said that he wasn't traumatized himself because he didn't really process it as molesting at the time because he didn't know what sex was, but he was breathing heavily and getting very agitated watching this when they were describing being molested."
Leaving Neverland,Thank you mods for finally making a thread about this that the MJ shills can't bury with downvotes.
Leaving Neverland,"Holy shit, the comments on youtube/metacritic reviews are wild."
Leaving Neverland,This was horrific. I needed a drink to get through. 
Leaving Neverland,I mean these stories seem pretty intricate and detailed to be fabricated but that‚Äôs just me. 
Leaving Neverland,I may be naive but I just wasn't aware there were still people that didn't know Michael Jackson was  a pedophile
Leaving Neverland,[deleted]
Leaving Neverland,"Wow those mothers were horrible.  Abandoning their families, dissolving their marriages, and leaving their children with an abuser while claiming it was ""all for my son's future"".  This was like watching those child pageant shows turned up to 11, and it was disgusting."
Leaving Neverland,"My issue was always this. I only needed to be wrongfully accused once to stop the behavior that got me accused. 

The fact that he kept doing it shows it was a compulsion."
Leaving Neverland,"There are going to be people who defend him no matter the evidence or proof that is brought to light.  I will never understand celebrity worship and the way we treat our celebrities (entertainment, sport and business) is disgusting.

I also thought MJ was off, but this documentary was so incredibly hard to watch.  People get so wrapped up in becoming famous or wanting their kids to become famous and rich, that they absolutely allow things that they wouldn't permit otherwise.

Would they let an adult neighbor/teacher/person they met four hours earlier spend hours with their kid, travel with him and sleep in the same bed??  Absolutely not.

Fame and wealth does not make someone safe and good, it just means that they have more resources to get away with bad behavior.  Talent doesn't make someone a good person.  Like everyone else, it's their actions and behaviors. 

There is NO good reason for a 30 year old to be SO interested and invested in a 7-10 year old kid.  The relationship should be formed with the parents, and if needed business managers.  

My husband I met and became friends with a celebrity - he is no way as famous as MJ, but is well known.  He is friendly and fun with our kids, but the friendship is between adults.  He could babysit for our kids, but if he decided our son was to go on tour with him or something like that, you better be sure that we would be there, and they would NOT be sleeping in the same room and holding hands. 

I'm not sure I am ready for Part 2. "
Leaving Neverland,Same story for R Kelly. Power and fame allow people to abuse and use others for whatever they want to do.
Leaving Neverland,[deleted]
Leaving Neverland,"Watched Part 1 last night. It was INSANE. Wow. So in detail, so shocking. Can't wait for part 2 tonight. 

I've never been the biggest fan of MJ, but I do find it weird that this documentary made me want to listen to his music ?? Either way, I'm not entirely sure if the accusations are true. I hope they're not."
Leaving Neverland,it‚Äôs funny how Jackson has a certain look that he likes. It‚Äôs crazy how he would call up a family and say that he was lonely and how the parents would sneak him out of his house and he would go to their house and spend the night. 
Leaving Neverland,"Micheal Jackson didn't just rape these young boys, he made them fall in love with him, crave his company, crave him sexually, and the he broke their hearts. Death is too sweet a slumber for you, Michael. "
Leaving Neverland,"Totally turned my view of Michael Jackson. Had to go down the rabbit hole after watching this. Reading about Omerr.... And the books he had locked away..and this is part 1? There is so much video footage of him, private stuff that's just impossible to even comprehend.

Definitely do yourself a favor and Google this shit. Holy fuck."
Leaving Neverland,"let‚Äôs do this: What if lady Gaga spent an exorbitant amount of money & time on being around little girls, seeking out specific girls and their families to shower time and attention onto, that would be weird, nice, but weird.  Not normal behavior.

I say this to assert that it is not a behavior that should be normalized.  Without Jackson‚Äôs fame, wealth, and influence this would be a reprehensible way of interacting with children. But because he was who he was it‚Äôs was innocent and ok?  Nah fuck that
"
Leaving Neverland,"So that one guy has, or had at one point, the Thriller jacket and Indy‚Äôs bullwhip? Two huge pieces of memorabilia! Just a point which stood out to me, wonder if he still has them?"
Leaving Neverland,"I haven't had the chance to watch the doc yet, but I'm so happy to see this thread isn't being run by the MJ sycophants. After weeks of fighting with their copy and pasted comments leading up to this doc, I was getting worried the top comment would be one of theirs. "
Leaving Neverland,Mr. Jefferson 
Leaving Neverland,"I just received a comment from someone who said ""But isn't Michael the biological father to his kids?""  

What the hell?  Some people are just blind or stupid about everything, including high school biology."
Leaving Neverland,When they left for the Grand Canyon without him. Jaw‚Äîon‚Äîthe‚Äîfloor.
Leaving Neverland,"It's like part of my childhood and the importance he played in our Culture is destroyed and tarnished.  I think there was always a shadow of possibility to the claims but Jesus, this feels pretty damn real for me, and truly devastating on many levels."
Leaving Neverland,This is even creepier than moonwalker.
Leaving Neverland,"I'm a big Michael Jackson fan, i love his music, had tickets for his show on february 8th 2010.

I never believed that he would ever do something to a kid but i did acknowledge that his behaviour was strange to say the least.

I'm 70 minutes in to the first part and i had multiple times where i seriously had to pause it and i said ""What the fuck"" to myself.

I don't know in what way stuff is lied about, one of them even witnessed for him right? And said he was innocent? Now he comes up with this... And i don't want to believe what he says but whenever other people tell me that he's lying i'm not sure what to say because it's to detailed in my opinion to be lied completely.

He was seriously insane in his head, but i doubt this was just because of him ""not having a childhood"" i'm quite sure there was more to it... 

This is well..... I'm not sure what to think actually..

&#x200B;"
Leaving Neverland,"That video of him talking to ‚Äúlittle one‚Äù was sick.  Im convinced, MJ is guilty af.  The evidence was disgusting but so real"
Leaving Neverland,"Stop a minute and imagine what it‚Äôs like to be an adult. Rudeness by the knowledge that you were abused as a child. When my sisters pedophile molester died we felt like her nightmare while not over, at least had ceased to be front page news. The nature of Jackson‚Äôs crimes is that this was never going to ever end for his victims and their families because his music keeps making hundreds of millions of dollars each year even ten years after his death.

I think they came forward now because they finally realized it was never going away and they would never know peace until the came forward.

"
Leaving Neverland,"Maybe it's because I grew up in the South Park era, but the pushback to this documentary is shocking. Of course he molested them. The sheer detail in the documentary of Jackson's grooming techniques reminded me of the testimonies at the Larry Nassar hearing.

Wade and James are so brave for this since the blowback will probably follow them and their families the rest of their lives. (And just so classic that the apologists come after the victims to try to proclaim Jackson's innocence.) Fuck Jackson. He's a monster - no wonder he needed to knock himself out to sleep toward the end. "
Leaving Neverland,"That was brutal to watch. 

Those guys went into extreme, embarrassing detail about what they went through as kids. 

At the very least, Michael Jackson is incredibly sketch. 

Most likely though, he was a straight up monster.

Fuck that dude."
Leaving Neverland,This was absolutely horrifying and broken down in such systemic detail that I fear other predators will utilize the same tactics.  
Leaving Neverland,"I have a question for older Redditors. In Part 1, Jimmy recalls talking to Jackson on the phone... and he states that all his friends at school said he \[Jackson\] was weird.

This conversation would have taken place in 1987. So I'm curious, from anyone who was grown-up at that time... at what point did Jackson's reputation start to slide from total all-star to weirdo/freakshow? By the time I first heard of MJ as a kid in 1993 (concurrent with the release of Free Willy), the freakshow had completely eclipsed any of his prior accomplishments. Anything associated with him, including his music, was more or less radioactive. It wasn't actually until he died in 2009 that I heard anyone in my social circles begin to speak positively about his music."
Leaving Neverland,[deleted]
Leaving Neverland,"I'm not sure what to think. I believe on some level his tendency to latch on to young boys was so he could live vicariously through them, to experience his dream childhood/the one he never had. But even if the sexual allegations are untrue, he treated these kids like boyfriends. He had an absolutely unhealthy fixation with youth and boundaries were absolutely crossed. There's no denying there was something seriously wrong with the guy.

Perhaps Macauley and Corey were not abused, but it doesn't mean Wade and Jimmy weren't. I could also understand Corey and Macauley defending Michael if they HAD been abused, since Corey is obviously still in a state of idol worship, and a high profile child actor could have their career prospects/brand damaged by becoming known as 'the kid Michael Jackson abused'. It's also just vile information to share on a world stage and it would be daunting to do so at any age. "
Leaving Neverland,"The fact that clinshes the whole thing for me is the facts about MJs bedroom. Leading to Michael's bedroom was many unnessary doors designed equiped with motion capture that would lead to a bell ringing besides Michael's bed. This would lead him to be aware of anyone coming withing 20 feet of his room.

This bell was not connected to the overall alarm security system. It wasn't designed to alert any of his security at all. The sole purpose of the bell was to make Michael aware that someone is nearing his bedroom and give him enough time to that situation.

Why would someone that supposedly only played video games or watched movies with the kids he was sharing a bed with be that terrified of someone randomly coming into the room to do all that? I'm sorry but the only logical explanation behind that would be if a person was terrified of anyone seeing what actually was going on in the bedroom. 

And that isn't the end of it. The whole neverland area was specifically designed to have several almost secluded rooms and houses designed to make it as hard as possible for anyone to see what was going around in these specific rooms and houses. If you take in that fact with the fact that Michael was obssessed with spending time with young kids and sleeping with them for me the only logical conclusion is that whatever Michael did with the kids was something much more going than just joyfully playing games and having fun with kids alone. For me it takes a logical leap to think that nothing weird was going around judged against that reality"
Leaving Neverland,"I've been a hardcore MJ fan since the age of 4. I can still remember the first time I saw him on TV. I remember being enchanted by his music and videos. Obviously, I am biased. I have believed in his innocence my entire life.

But this documentary has me questioning that. His behavior was extremely suspect. I don't know if he is or is not guilty, but this documentary has me feeling extremely conflicted. It's painful to think that a man I have idolized since childhood could be capable of such evil actions.

For the record, I think both sides of the story deserve to be examined. People splitting into two camps and attacking each other changes nothing."
Leaving Neverland,I got halfway through and had to turn if off. The descriptions were so graphic especially juxtaposed with pictures of them as little kids. I always thought his obsessions with kids was weird but I don't think I realized that it was exclusively little boys. What innocent explanation is there for that kind of marked preference? 
Leaving Neverland,"It‚Äôs astonishing to see the effort MJ put in to not only groom the boys, but their families as well. Really unsettling."
Leaving Neverland,"This whole thing was incredibly sick. I feel that the victims probably came forward at this point because they felt safe. I don‚Äôt think this would have been possible if Jackson was alive with his impact and cult following. Even now it‚Äôs crazy for them.

There‚Äôs a lot of conflicting evidence, but these men gave very vivid descriptions of vile sexual acts so I‚Äôm apt to believe that something went down. It was sickening to watch and *if* they indeed are lying, they‚Äôre psychopaths to make up something so sick. "
Leaving Neverland,Michael Jackson cult comments incoming.
Leaving Neverland,"""The Jackson family has taken yet another step to turn viewers away from [*Leaving Neverland*](https://decider.com/show/leaving-neverland/). On Sunday night, at the same time as the film‚Äôs HBO premiere, the Jackson estate posted an entire [Michael Jackson](https://decider.com/tag/michael-jackson/) concert film on YouTube. In an obvious dig at the doc, *Live in Bucharest (The Dangerous Tour)*¬†is the exact same run-time as *Leaving Neverland*,""

&#x200B;

Jeez .. it's almost as if they're trying to silence the victims from being heard, and are so afraid that the documentary will hurt their wealth & cashflow.  Have any of the Jackson family members ever had to work a honest day in their lives or are they all living off Michael's earnings? Sad."
Leaving Neverland,"my theory on macaulay culkin and corey feldman saying they were not sexually abused by michael jackson:

mj kept these two boys as ""controls"" so to speak. never actually molested those two. they were also more high profile/famous than the ones he actually molested. hence, the vehement denials from culkin and feldman. mj knew he would need ppl to testify for him in case anyone ever brought charges. 

another tidbit. i noticed culkin had done an AMA on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7tuvbc/this_is_macaulay_culkin_this_is_the_most/

where someone asked him ""whats your fav memory of mj"" 
and he responded "" when i almost crashed my golf cart into his and he called me applehead"" 

APPLEHEAD. same nickname he used for little wade. 

ok that's all. this is like my second post ever on reddit. not too familiar with the platform. 


"
Leaving Neverland,"This is especially heartbreaking as a Jackson fan. So many red flags I ignored out of denial.

My favorite MJ song is actually pretty unknown, but it‚Äôs called The Way You Love Me. It was written for the 90s boy band Hanson. I used to think that MJ wrote it thinking that they would do well on the harmonies with their vocal range. Now I think that he literally wrote it *for* them. ü§¢

Edit: also, all of the misogyny that he‚Äôs accused of really holds up when evaluating how he wrote about women. From Billie Jean to Dangerous to Blood on the Dance Floor. Women are so often depicted as predatory and untrustworthy in his music. "
Leaving Neverland,"I'm glad I found this discussion... WOO BOY I am traumatized after watching part 1... like I feel like a different person after having seen it. Not sure I can stomach part 2. I may have to wait a few weeks. This is definitely not a 'date night' flick, holy shit. I had to turn it off whenever my husband would come in the room. It was just SO uncomfortable and traumatic. The thing that's been bothering me the most is the whole Wade story... oh my god that poor innocent child... just seeing him with that goddamned perm his mom gave him to look more like MJ, god it breaks my heart... and when he described leaving his dad and brother to come to Cali to see MJ again and make it big, but MJ was practically ignoring him now and had even (deliberately) set them up in a shit hotel and was being aloof with the family -- when Wade had been accustomed to the star treatment... my god my heart was absolutely breaking and I wanted to cry. Just seeing his face and knowing how traumatized he had to have been as such a little child, my god I am not right after watching that. F*CK MICHAEL JACKSON AND HIS WHOLE F*CKING SCHEME. I wish he was still alive so I could go shove a stick up his a**. As a big fan of his music and dancing forever (I honestly did not know many details of all the allegations because I just didn't want to look that far into it; however I never defended him or though the accusers were lying), after seeing this I can say with complete conviction that I will never listen to his music or watch another video of his for the rest of my life.  An aside - big ups to LaToya for not defending him and basically outing him back in the late 80s/early 90s; she was a brave woman and I applaud that. The rest of the family was scared they would be cut off financially by MJ, but she DNGAF!"
Leaving Neverland,"Never cried so hard about a documentary.  Wasn't prepared for that at all.  I expected something more...salacious maybe?  Scandalous?  I dunno.  It was actually very depressing.  Not one bit surprising though.  Just more smoke to add to the raging dumpster fire that was his criminal legacy.  

I worry about Wade because of his genetic predisposition to bipolar/suicide.  And Jimmy is obviously affected severely.  I'm glad they have supportive spouses if nothing else.  The take-home message for me is:  therapy works.  Don't be hard headed or too prideful to seek help if you're struggling.  Speaking the truth is also vital for healing.  I know so many people--mostly men--who have serious issues but refuse any type of help.  It's frustrating because this stuff doesn't magically resolve itself.  

For those claiming he was ""found innocent"" at those trials:  so fucking what.  If you think money & celebrity don't influence a jury, you're sadly naive of the American justice system.  Also:  You can't be found innocent--only not guilty.  There IS a difference.  Beyond a reasonable doubt is the standard in criminal court, and that's a high standard (as it should be).  Doesn't mean you're innocent; just that there's not enough evidence to convict.  I don't know how much more ""evidence"" you could ever ask for in this case.  You don't need video tape or DNA when there are this many victims, witnesses & insanely detailed/painful stories.  This is real life, not CSI.  "
Leaving Neverland,"I'm just so overwhelmed with the horror of it. Imagine bending over and holding your most intimate private areas open for inspection while a very odd creature is ogling you and jacking off? At any age this is incredibly traumatic. And with your parents approval essentially, you would just think it's another thing about the world that's awful. Then to not be believed. This is what happens in many rape cases. Or spousal abuse. You don't  want it to be true. You lie, you lie to yourself, because the truth is just so painful. You dont want to be; ""the rape victim. The molestation victim."" You just want to be whole again. So you pretend. Until the cognitive dissonance starts to make your brain hurt so much, that the truth MUST come out"
Leaving Neverland,"Well, this seems like a controversial documentary. Both the men describes similar acts and behaviors. It‚Äôs interesting how much control he had over these parents immediately and how easily he got them to let their guard down with their kids. I‚Äôm sure you assume the most famous person in the world wouldn‚Äôt hurt your kid, but it‚Äôs still a sketchy situation. We can‚Äôt take every documentary as facts but we also can‚Äôt flat out deny their testimony either, they have documents and recordings of weird behavior, even if it wasn‚Äôt blatantly sexual. It‚Äôs another piece in the weird puzzle of Jackson‚Äôs life, you can decide for yourself if the pieces fit or not. "
Leaving Neverland,This is hard to watch. Maybe they're lying but these guys seem to be in real agony.
Leaving Neverland,The biggest controversy is wade robson having the Australian accent as a kid then an American accent now
Leaving Neverland,"I feel like having Culkin and Corey Feldman around and NOT abusing them was a very calculated move.  He knew one day he might need them to testify and because they were so famous at the time their testimony would say a lot.  So in a way he groomed them as well, to be his defense down the line.  So I do not think he abused them, but he for sure sexually abused many other boys.  It was calculated, just like marrying Lisa Marie was a calculated move. "
Leaving Neverland,"People love Micheal Jackson so much they gloss over any possibility of these stories being true, to the point where they don't even want to hear the stories of the so-called victims. 

To me it kinda resembles those black women outside R. Kelly court room, but much bigger because although most people only liked R. Kelly for his music, people loved Micheal Jackson as a person. 

I might be in the minority here with this opinion, but I think every *victim's* tale deserves to be heard if they have even the least bit substantial evidence to support it, even if there's a big chance they could be lying. Unless you were there and saw with your own eyes that things didn't go down the way they said it did, just hear them out, it doesnt hurt. "
Leaving Neverland,To the defenders - would you let your child sleep overnight in the same bed with a man acting as MJ did? Take the fact that it was MJ out of the equation.
Leaving Neverland,"I can empathise with both of the mums about the circumstances of meeting Michael and going to Neverland etc because they were groomed just as much as the boys, but I will never understand why any mother could let their 7 year old child sleep in the same room as a 30 year old man on their own, repeatedly. Don't get it. Especially when his excuse was ""watching movies and playing games"" dude, he literally had a theatre in his home. Ridiculous "
Leaving Neverland,"the predator behavior, the conscious way of grooming, wooing, isolating and moving to the next one are damning."
Leaving Neverland,"‚ÄúHe sexually abused me for 7 years.‚Äù Damn came out the gate swinging. I have a feeling this will be hard to watch. 

For the people saying these people are lying, what purpose would they have now that MJ is dead? "
Leaving Neverland,That was really difficult to watch. Respect to the filmmakers for not sparing details.
Leaving Neverland,"Serious question.

I am an MJ fan and currently believe he is innocent. I will watch the documentary with an open mind.

Would the FBI or law enforcement agencies be able to retrospectively investigate the case in light of these new testimonies?

Someone said something about MJJ productions being a ‚Äòpedo machine‚Äô that allowed him to carry out these acts - surely they can investigate?"
Leaving Neverland,I'm curious if in the age of the #MeToo if we'll see the court of public opinion shift against Michael Jackson. He's still so popular even since he's been dead. 
Leaving Neverland,Michael Jackson was a pedophile

When did he even find time to rehearse and record? Damn."

Leaving Neverland,"Whether or not the documentary is all true or not, i feel incredibly sad for MJ's kids. They probably have so many questions ad feelings about this entire thing, and just their dad i general that they will never get answers to."
Leaving Neverland,"Well, that was devastating. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever willingly listen to Jackson‚Äôs music again, and any time I hear it, this film will be what I think about. 

The MJ truthers are practically complicit in the abuse."
A Thousand Goodnights,"The first incident took place during the sports segment of independent TV station¬†WGN-TV's 9:00 p.m. newscast: https://youtube.com/watch?v=dKnwhokvgxE

A Thousand Goodnights,"This remains the white whale of awesome TV conspiracies and such

I wish we knew more, but its probably yielded all the info it ever will already, which got us no where. So interesting.

I still believe the most likely case was that it was from the local hacking/phreaking community who worked with someone on the inside or someone who had detailed technical knowledge and means (probably from working TV ops) to somehow disrupt the signal and replace with theirs (in some way, be it a transmitter or something less technically  complicated)"
A Thousand Goodnights,"This is honestly the best kind of unsolved mystery, something legitimately weird and silly and a little bit creepy in which nobody got hurt and anybody who knows anything - and, surely, there must be *somebody* out there who does - also knows well enough to keep their trap shut. (The statute of limitations for any legal repercussions elapsed back in 1992, so there's really no reason for anyone with any knowledge not to come forward save for the fact that it's just more interesting if they don't.)

It's also a real and valuable glimpse into a now-long-gone era when television, as a medium, actually felt as though it could potentially be *dangerous*, that it could be (and, here, was) harnessed for culturally subversive means. Cable TV piracy was a real thing (as was the truly bizarre Wild West of public access television, where any nutbar with a soapbox could and would put themselves out there for the world to see), and - as David Cronenberg has remarked, when discussing the inspirations for Videodrome - there seemed a real possibility that an unwary viewer might stumble across something forbidden, something they weren't really meant to see. TV signals are protected now in ways that render this all but impossible, but this incident is such an encapsulation of that scary and kind of thrilling idea."

So they didn't need to access the inside of the tv station, at all."

A Thousand Goodnights,Doing this with nothing interesting or important to say deserves very harsh penalty. What a waste.
A Thousand Goodnights,The Malicious Life podcast did a good episode on this: https://www.cybereason.com/blog/malicious-life-podcast-the-max-headroom-signal-hijack
A Thousand Goodnights,This is really freaky.
A Thousand Goodnights,"I was a teenager then living in Chicago. We used to record Doctor Who most of the time because it was on too late to stay up and watch on a Sunday night... because we had school in the morning. For some reason we forgot to set the VCR to record that night.

When the news came out that this happened on WTTW during Doctor Who, we were SO MAD that we didn't have the VCR recording of it.

I'm still kind of mad at myself for this.

Always thought it was so weird that people went through all the trouble and possible jail time to do this (the FCC takes this kind of thing VERY seriously), then have basically nothing interesting to broadcast. Sure, it's weird and freaky. But you'd think they'd have had something more interesting to broadcast than a bunch of garbled nonsense in a Max Headroom costume."
A Thousand Goodnights,Was this before WGN became a cable TV channel?
A Thousand Goodnights,"""Horror of Fang Rock"" is actually a very good story. Also, *Doctor Who* is 59 today."
A Thousand Goodnights,It was ;)
A Thousand Goodnights,It seemed really cringy to me.
A Thousand Goodnights,I really miss how small yet wide reaching  Reddit was ages ago.
A Thousand Goodnights,"I think you are right. This type of thing would have been the challenge that phreakers would be into. The content of the broadcast doesn‚Äôt really mean anything, I think they just wanted to see if they could do it."
A Thousand Goodnights,">  a now-long-gone era when television, as a medium, actually felt as though it could potentially be dangerous, that it could be (and, here, was) harnessed for culturally subversive means. 

lol I know you didn't mean it this way, but we're still in that era, and television is definitely [dangerous to our democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rknON89H35o)"
A Thousand Goodnights,Nightmare fuel
A Thousand Goodnights,This is maybe #500 on the list of things to be afraid of in Chicago at 1AM
A Thousand Goodnights,*In the city of Chicago/ as the evening shadows fall/ there are people dreaming/ of the hills of Donegal* Always pops into my head when I hear the word ‚ÄòChicago‚Äô. But the man from Kildare with a very sweaty head does it better than I ever could https://youtu.be/VZmfMc7lzQo
A Thousand Goodnights,"It's 4am. I _was_ asleep but woke up. 

Maybe the universe wants me to watch this video."
A Thousand Goodnights,"This is just how TV transmission works. No one is really sure how they actually did this. 

Whatever it was, it almost certainly required a lot of technical expertise, so at least one member of this probably was familiar with the setups of local TV stations transmission, probably from working there (although doesn't HAVE to be that, its a good chance), had access to good equipment and more.  -- assuming this is how they did it, which we still don't know, it certainly could have been a far less technically sophisticated situation."
A Thousand Goodnights,The first time I saw this on YouTube I thought he said ‚ÄúI stole CBS‚Äù.
A Thousand Goodnights,Everything is digital now. So it‚Äôs much harder to tap into a broadcast signal.
A Thousand Goodnights,Doctor Who. Particularly [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_of_Fang_Rock) episode.
A Thousand Goodnights,"The question isn't ***what*** show was on, but ***when*** show was on."
A Thousand Goodnights,The program is Dr. Who.
A Thousand Goodnights,"It appeared during the news, and then again a few hours later during an episode of Doctor Who"
A Thousand Goodnights,">But you'd think they'd have had something more interesting to broadcast than a bunch of garbled nonsense in a Max Headroom costume.

Seems likely they were just trying to see/prove that they could do it."
A Thousand Goodnights,"No. I personally remember seeing WGN on cable in the '80s, but according to wiki, their first cable service to carry them was in 1978."
A Thousand Goodnights,"WGN had essentially two feeds. One local for Chicago and one for nationwide. The nationwide feed would carry many of the same programs as the Chicago feed, but sometimes the feed would be different. This is because some of WGNs rerun rights were only for the Chicago market. 

It was a similar situation for WTBS in Atlanta"
A Thousand Goodnights,"Ah, yes.  That interminable war between the Sontarans and the Rutans‚Ä¶"
A Thousand Goodnights,Giggity
A Thousand Goodnights,"The sheer technical prowess to pull it off, with the very real threat of jail time, makes this legend.  

I realize this is like someone projecting ‚Äúmade you look!‚Äù On the moon; amazing achievement undercut by a puerile joke."
A Thousand Goodnights,I had just gotten into Reddit around that time. People missed the vibe from before reddit was popular at all back then.
A Thousand Goodnights,Agreed. It was just the can we actually do it aspect.  Very much in line with a lot of hacking phreaking communities of the era
A Thousand Goodnights,It was ;)
A Thousand Goodnights,Bribe tech ops to slip a tape in the machine would be easiest.
A Thousand Goodnights,They googled it from the future.
A Thousand Goodnights,Tom Baker was the best Doctor.
A Thousand Goodnights,True. Then it become DIGG+4chan+tumblr outcasts
A Thousand Goodnights,I can't believe I've been on reddit for 12 years (deleted my first account). But tbh it had the same vibe back then. Unless you mean way before that. There were a lot more cringe meme subs that were popular though.
A Thousand Goodnights,20 minutes into the future
A Thousand Goodnights,"Next Sunday, A.D."
A Thousand Goodnights,"I love the kitty cat episode, didn't even expect it to be in the show but they nailed the issue in 15 minutes."
A Thousand Goodnights,A dream of 1000 cats was the BeST episode
A Thousand Goodnights,"This was easily the strangest part of S1....to me. I've not read the source material, one of the only Gaiman works I've left off, and the random cat animation was somehow kind of jarring and off putting to me. Will there be more of it in S2?"
A Thousand Goodnights,My cat never watches the TV. She sat down and watched the whole episode. Kinda worries me.
A Thousand Goodnights,"Easily the best episode of TV I watched this year so far. And no, my cat isn't forcing me to type this ^^^^help ^^^^please."
A Thousand Goodnights,"No idea, but there are a few standalone stories/vignettes that really fill out the universe and add colour"
A Thousand Goodnights,"Not of this story specifically but Sandman is largely made up of short stories like it. For example the immortal guy who meets Morpheus at the bar every 100 years, the muse, and ‚Äúthe sound of her wings‚Äù. Next season will probably have the story of the deal Morpheus made with Shakespeare, what happened to his son, and why Nada is in hell"
A Thousand Goodnights,"The cat episode came out a week after season 1. 

I've told my cousin who is watching to wait a week before watching that episode.  It's better better watch it a bit after the first season."
A Thousand Goodnights,"Sorry you're being downvoted for having an opinion.

I found it very...different, but I still liked it. I can understand why it might not appeal to all"
A Thousand Goodnights,Yes‚Ä¶jarring and off putting is genuinely the Gaiman Aesthetic. All his book covers and children book illustrations are pretty much in the same-ish vibe despite different artists.
A Thousand Goodnights,Really ü§î share the pic
A Thousand Goodnights,"Hey thanks for the reply, didn't mean to offend the community, not sure why people are DVing, the cat scene just clashed w the aesthetic, to me."
A Thousand Goodnights,"Interesting. Thanks for the info. I wasn't trying to upset people here, just my opinion and wanted more info. Love the show in total."
A Thousand Goodnights,"On its own I do like it. I was just really into Dream and his voice, energy, whole thing. And, like many, I binge watched it. Spacing out and rewatching might help me. 

Thanks for your comment!"
A Thousand Goodnights,"I have one!

Not going to share it, though. I don‚Äôt want my real identity connected to this account."
A Thousand Goodnights,If you read sandman it doesn't have a set aesthetic. Likely the show will live up to that. Sandman is basically just whatever it feels like at the time
A Thousand Goodnights,"Comics often are made up of short arcs and standalone stories with varying artists with widely different aesthetics, so I‚Äôm glad that the show respects the comic book origins (and completely avoiding the Netflix/Disney + issue of 10 hour movies)."
A Thousand Goodnights,"We all know it's you, Matthew"
A Thousand Goodnights,"That sounds interesting. I loved the first season. I read Gaiman being cautiously optimistic a second season could even happen due to how costly it is to make. I hope it takes the heck off, it's really good."
A Thousand Goodnights,Who's Matthew
A Thousand Goodnights,Matthew balls
A Thousand Goodnights,Any news on Taboo?
A Thousand Goodnights,"Interesting, I don't think there's been a boxing TV show since Lights Out.

I'll keep an eye out for this."
A Thousand Goodnights,"I'll watch anything with Stephen Graham, he's one of the best actors of the last 20+ years."
A Thousand Goodnights,Is this a remake?   I think it was on Pornhub a few years ago.
A Thousand Goodnights,That‚Äôs a very generous definition of ‚Äúheavyweight.‚Äù
A Thousand Goodnights,"I'll repeat what somebody else said:

> That‚Äôs a very generous definition of ‚Äúheavyweight.‚Äù"
A Thousand Goodnights,"I mean, it should be grand, but Disney+.."
A Thousand Goodnights,"I read somewhere that they were gearing up for a second season. 

Edit: [Found this.](https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/taboo-season-2-production-2023-newsupdate/)"
A Thousand Goodnights,"Not that I am aware of, sorry to say."
A Thousand Goodnights,I really enjoyed Lights Out! Too bad it was only one season. I recently watched Mindhunter and was glad to see Holt McCallany in it - hope they get around to making a third season sometime soon.
A Thousand Goodnights,"Well the comment is right there, you dont need to repeat it."
A Thousand Goodnights,"I agree with it, so I'll repeat it over a salty OP downvoting comments he doesn't like."
A Thousand Goodnights,"I listened to the newly released podcast(Which unfortunately was done on Zoom and everyone has shitty mics, cmon HBO you can afford to send blue yetis to people atleast ffs), and Tom Hanks mentioned that he would always tell people to show up, even if they had no scenes or major important roles.

He would tell them to just show up and do something in the background, eat choclate, lay down, bandage yourself etc....this made the entire series feel like it was an actual war and people were there, instead of just scenes in a tv show."
A Thousand Goodnights,Great catch!
Playing with Fire,Just saw it.  Can't recommend.  Don't waste your time on this.
Playing with Fire,Very cool
Playing with Fire,"Not my Ignacio, could never be my precious Ignacio"
Playing with Fire,They were arguing over the definition of insanity
Playing with Fire,"Ah, I like him. Please don‚Äôt let this be something that‚Äôs life altering and stupid."
Playing with Fire,"They didn't name which cast member he had issues with:

>The Better Call Saul alum, who was set to star in the eight-episode series from Ridley Scott, was dismissed from the show following a clash with a co-star.   

  
>Mando‚Äôs role has been recast, with Narcos alum Wagner Moura set to take on the part. Moura will reteam with Apple after previously appearing in Shining Girls for the streamer.
   
>Mando, who played Nacho on all six seasons of AMC‚Äôs Better Call Saul, was let go after an on-set incident. Producers attempted to smooth things out, and the decision was made to let Mando go from the series and recast the role."
Playing with Fire,"ayy details

Wagner Moura ain't no slouch, that's some top notch replacement"
Playing with Fire,He must have stolen someone's baseball cards.
Playing with Fire,lalo salamanca strikes again
Playing with Fire,"Crazy! This was a big opportunity, damn. Must have truly been inexcusable."
Playing with Fire,There are some reports that Apple spent $50 million on the pilot for this show. Ridley Scott rented out an entire city to this show.
Playing with Fire,"Like Greg from Dharma and Greg, on that CBS show I assume was about thinky murders"
Playing with Fire,Can we all take a moment to appreciate the fact that Ridley Scott is 85 years old and seems to have more projects in recent years than when he was much younger.
Playing with Fire,"Aw man, Nacho not getting along with Paper Boi? That's sad, I like them both :("
Playing with Fire,He needs a lawyer
Playing with Fire,"According to Entertainment Weekly it was a ""physical altercation."" https://ew.com/tv/michael-mando-exits-sinking-spring-wagner-moura-replace/?utm\_campaign=entertainmentweekly\_entertainmentweekly&utm\_content=new&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=twitter.com&utm\_term=63fa8f70ebdba800016b6a4f"
Playing with Fire,That's a bummer. Hope he's okay. He's insanely talented and has a bright future.
Playing with Fire,Good. now he has time to play scorpion in a new spiderman movie
Playing with Fire,Michael Mando looking to follow in the steps of Michael Pitt
Playing with Fire,Damnnn clashed with Brian Tyree Henry?
Playing with Fire,This guy is an outstanding actor. That‚Äôs all I know lol.
Playing with Fire,"Spanish-language twitter says he ‚Äúcame to blows‚Äù with ‚Äúone of his co-stars,‚Äù fwiw."
Playing with Fire,Mandon't
Playing with Fire,Adios Nachito
Playing with Fire,I‚Äôd like to hear the whole story on this. Hollywood I don‚Äôt trust so much
Playing with Fire,"Reminds me after Homecoming, he went on talk shows to say he‚Äôs going to be a big part of the next Spider-Man movie and how his character would be the next big bad for spidey, despite there‚Äôs no script yet since Homecoming just premiered. And then that character was never seen again."
Playing with Fire,can we not speculate on his actions with only the bare minimum details
Playing with Fire,I wonder what happened those two leads mentioned seem cool AF to me
Playing with Fire,"Nah bro he should have called Saul, he has his rights it‚Äôs in the constitution üíÄ"
Playing with Fire,Well that's disappointing :|
Playing with Fire,Did he try telling the definition of insanity?
Playing with Fire,Bad Boy for life!
Playing with Fire,Gigantic upgrade imo. Moura is a monster of an actor.
Playing with Fire,He looks like the guy from Far Cry 3
Playing with Fire,"I am sure we will be hearing more about this as time goes on. And maybe this take will age badly but, do people understand that actors (and actresses) tend to be a little bit crazy/broken to begin with. I mean, they are in a profession that is about getting attention for being dramatic. One might say acting is the art of lying in convincing way that makes for a watchable spectacle. 

This isn't to say they are bad people but I am not surprised when clashes happen and I tend to give some benefit of the doubt to people who might be in conflict with them. Kind of like how parents yelling at their kids in the supermarket aren't monsters even though if a video gets posted all these anonymous folks online act like they are."
Playing with Fire,Michael ManDOH!!
Playing with Fire,This isn't the way.
Playing with Fire,"Damn, seems out of character from what I have seen of him in interviews and off screen stuff. Unfortunate, hopefully this doesn't become an issue for getting roles in the future. I feel like you rarely hear about issues like this and people generally don't get fired unless its something serious? To a certain degree you hear of cast members not gelling, but it doesn't cause firings all the time?"
Playing with Fire,"Alright, maybe I'm just an idiot, but do we even know if this is true? I can't find any other sources (except a few other pretty much copy-pasted newspaper articles and one wikipedia user) about this and it seems as if Mando is still part of the cast according to imdb (not that it means much)

It also seems like an unlikely chain of events to me, like what would be an incident big enough that a guy who spent six seasons on a successful show being well-liked by pretty much everyone in the cast getting  to work with highly desirable talents suddenly is fired  due to... an ""altercation""? What did he do, brawl with Ridley Scott? It just seems incredibly weird that an evidently intellectually curious, somewhat artsy guy like Mando seems to be in interviews, would decide to just assault someone during a movie production lol

I don't think anyone should see this as anything else but a rumour until it's confirmed by someone actually working on the production. I feel like the most probable thing in case it is true is that Mando had some ""creative differences"" with the other production members over something and that it was overblown by the ""sources"", but then again it's clearly a big production that would significantly boost Mando's career, which in my opinion makes the whole thing even less likely to be true since I can't see him sacrificing that over chicanerous slugfest with Ridley Scott

In other words, I just really wanted to see Michael Mando in this role and I'm now trying to pretend that it isn't true in order to tame my disappointment, but oh well"
Playing with Fire,wagner moura is an upgrade lmao
Playing with Fire,[removed]
Playing with Fire,"I loved him in Better Call Saul, but his interviews always gave off a fairly intense vibe."
Playing with Fire,Other? Comment
Playing with Fire,I remember hearing a story that he was also difficult to work with on ‚ÄúGood Girls‚Äù and the only reason they kept him on was at Christina Hendricks insistence.
Playing with Fire,This is controversial but I always thought he was one of the weaker parts of BCS. He always seemed like he was acting his lines.
Playing with Fire,I guess I was wrong
Playing with Fire,[removed]
Playing with Fire,[removed]
Playing with Fire,"I got as far as ""Apple series"" and lost interest."
Playing with Fire,Everyone has gotten so sensitive.  A good feud used to be great publicity.
Playing with Fire,Who? Fired from what?
Playing with Fire,[deleted]
Playing with Fire,Who?
Playing with Fire,This must be a publicity in order to get him back in Spider-Man 4 Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal are pulling strings behind the camera and instructed Vass to fuck around his latest project that said I always wanted to see Scorpion on screen I think this is a freedom given to him by the producers.
Playing with Fire,"Dammit Nacho! Oh well, I‚Äôm really looking forward to the series‚Ä¶"
Playing with Fire,I got swag and i wanted to make it look good. What is drugs?
Playing with Fire,"Sorry to hear. I'm a big fan of Mando.

Hopefully this is just a temporary setback."
Playing with Fire,"Where is your robe, Ignacio?"
Playing with Fire,"Wow, I wonder what warranted this. Sucks because I was excited to see him and BTH on the same screen."
Playing with Fire,"Damn that sucks, I was so excited to seeing him and Brian Tyree Henry on this show. I wonder if he is the co-star he clashed with."
Playing with Fire,Okay there is a town called Sinking Spring in Pa semi close to philly. Is it about this town?
Playing with Fire,Fuck them
Playing with Fire,He's the character from pop copy in real life
Playing with Fire,Replaced with a glow up though! Never thought I‚Äôd see the day when Pablo Escobar and Paper Boi were in a show together!!
Playing with Fire,"Second time a guy named ""Mando"" is fired from his job."
Playing with Fire,Stealing him blind!
Playing with Fire,"It wasn't me, it was Ignacio!"
Playing with Fire,He was working with Alvarez for years
Playing with Fire,I always felt like i know this guy when i watched breaking bad. I just realized hes Vaas. After years.
Playing with Fire,Must have been some kind of cartel conflict.
Playing with Fire,I guess he won the debate.
Playing with Fire,You don‚Äôt fuck with Vaas
Playing with Fire,That‚Äôs insane
Playing with Fire,Hahah beat me too it
Playing with Fire,He keeps doing that...
Playing with Fire,I was thinking he stole the other person's baseball card collection.
Playing with Fire,"I like him too. However, how often do you hear about a conflict so big they stop and recast? I think this is going to stick until he has another home run role to shake it. Hope he lands one soon."
Playing with Fire,"Honestly sometimes people just don't gel and can't rise above a clash in personalities with their professionalism, though that's usually what you do screen tests for: to make sure actors have chemistry and are capable of working together."
Playing with Fire,"No reason to think he's at fault.  This is Hollywood, usually they protect the biggest asshole on the set and fire the one victimized."
Playing with Fire,Probably walked up to Ridley Scott and said he liked Harison Ford‚Äôs narration in Blade Runner.  Ridley would have to be held back.
Playing with Fire,I'm thinking Kate Mulgrew.
Playing with Fire,"Brian Tyree Henry, maybe."
Playing with Fire,I love Mando but swapping him out for Moura is like when Doctor Strange 2 swapped Scott Derrickson for Sam Raimi.
Playing with Fire,Uh oh. Somebody‚Äôs fucking up their career.
Playing with Fire,[deleted]
Playing with Fire,">*didn‚Äôt name which costar he had issues with.*

How could be anyone other than series‚Äô second-banana [Brian Tyree Henry] and still be dismissed? Unless he was politicking for feme-counterparts to share the makeup dept‚Äôs trailer, or the right to bring live ammunition or arsonists on set‚Ä¶?"
Playing with Fire,"As a Brazilian, I'm happy Wagner Moura is getting steady work in the US. He is great."
Playing with Fire,"If you‚Äôve any interest check out the new Puss in Boots movie, it‚Äôs legitimately great and Wagner‚Äôs the best part."
Playing with Fire,"I like the original actor. But Moura is big get for a replacement!  

 If they had him in the wings Mando could have brought the wrong coffee one morning and got axed.  There‚Äôs a job security in being difficult to replace but no matter how good you are if your employer thinks you can be competently replaced you lose your leverage."
Playing with Fire,i can't remember which comedy show it was exactly but it reminds me of the time a crowd got told that louis ck wasn't showing up to do his set so they got a last minute replacement and it was bill burr or chappelle or someone else that was big.
Playing with Fire,We can fix this. Get me a pimento sandwich.
Playing with Fire,And he gets to be an actor?
Playing with Fire,Colin Robinson‚Äôs baseball cards.
Playing with Fire,I‚Äôm watching that episode this very moment. So weird.
Playing with Fire,No. Word on the street is he killed someone and forced their brother to ally with the forces of Sintra. And kill a lot of cassowaries. Like a lot.
Playing with Fire,Michaaaeeel Mandooooo.
Playing with Fire,"I hope it wasn't anything too bad, I've liked him since Orphan Black"
Playing with Fire,Callsheet is also a seniority list. Don't piss off #1
Playing with Fire,"It could have been nothing at all. The star could have said, fire him or I walk."
Playing with Fire,Yeah calling it ‚Äúa clash‚Äù sounds like some understatement to fire someone highish profile like this. I‚Äôd guess either physical assault or like suuuuper racist comments. I wouldn‚Äôt think just being a jerk or yelling would be enough.
Killer Ratings,[deleted]
Killer Ratings,"Great, another self proclaimed feminist writes about shows she won't even bother to watch. If you don't have victims, you don't have narrative, you don't have a show.

She only uses 'feminism' 15 times in the article, and patriarchy once, so there's that :p"
Killer Ratings,violence aside... both shows show boobies. that's what draws me in. 
Killer Ratings,"Yeah, Westeros prides itself in its equal-opportunity murder policy."
Killer Ratings,"I would imagine their point is the exploitation of the death of females in order to elicit a stronger emotional reaction (Idk I didn't have time to read the article).  I guess they find that problematic because it makes use of the latent human prejudice regarding the vulnerability of women.  At the same time however, the number of male deaths is, indeed, quite high.  It would be easy to argue both sides in a ""Quantity vs. Quality"" type of argument I guess, but I think the easiest solution would be to choose to ignore the gender of the killee and instead focus on the character themselves."
Killer Ratings,Mmm whatcha saaayyy üé∂
Killer Ratings,"If you watch the pilot, it‚Äôs really striking how well shot and cinematic the episode is, especially for that era."
Killer Ratings,Chuck premiered the same week that Gossip Girl did. Both shows were co-created by Schwartz. Pretty good follow up to The OC.
Killer Ratings,"The show struck a good balance between being genuinely earnest but also being light hearted enough. It‚Äôs like the opposite of Disney shows which just try to be clever and meta. Also the soundtrack was killer in the OC, one of the GOATs lol"
Killer Ratings,Jason Schwartzman played the drums in the band that did the theme song.
Killer Ratings,"I came to this show pretty late - not because I thought it was ""ew girls"" shit like a lot of dudes online did, but because I basically just... missed it. Gilmore Girls I caught, Veronica Mars I caught, Dawson's I caught, you could argue Smallville fits in there too, LOL. I just missed The OC. 

Finally went back a little bit ago to work through it after too many friends told me it's just a really charming soap opera that somehow manages to whipsaw between tones really well so that you dont' stop to think about things like ""the guy whose dad was in the closet just got shot in the arm like 3 weeks ago and now he's best friends with everyone despite screaming ""Welcome to the OC Bitch"" at our 35-year old teenage lead about 2 months prior."" 

This show really is influential in a bunch of ways that I don't know it gets a whole lot of credit for. I do think it honestly works best as a comedy than it does the high-level drama it tried to be later, but there is a striking amount of empathy and thoughtfulness behind its glossy exterior. 

In closing: Sandy Cohen for President."
Killer Ratings,"the score is really the GOAT

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNysqyx5WuQ"
Killer Ratings,"Great show, loved it at the time. Will probably get a lot of hate on Reddit because teenage girls liked it."
Killer Ratings,"I'm Team One Tree Hill but I still have some nostalgia for the OC. I think the Seth character in particular was influential for making geekdom hot/mainstream. The setting and hot characters and humor made it cool. I think it was accessible to adults.

I lost interest early in season 2. It was obvious they used all their story material in season 1 and the pace slowed to a crawl. One difference between then and now is how fast people could turn on you if the show wasn't as good anymore (happened with Heroes as well). Nowadays with stan culture once the OC fanbase established itself after season 1 some people would feel obligated to be a loyal soldier for it the rest of its run. 

Getting cancelled early was probably the best thing for it. A good comp for its arc is actually the first four seasons of Homeland. Season 1: by far most popular season, probably wasted too many storylines Season 2: mixed feelings, still some memorable things season 3: rock bottom for public interest, ends in Brody/Marissa death season 4: Gets some positive ""hey this show is actually better now that they killed off Brody/Marissa!"" buzz. If Homeland ended after the positively received season 4 I think people would have looked back at it more fondly. Instead Showtime did its thing."
Killer Ratings,This first season was iconic for my high school cohort.  Still consider the ultimate early-2000s nostalgia.
Killer Ratings,"Literally one of the best shows ever. I wish they‚Äôd reboot, the ending was perfect for one ‚Äî but the cast has said they‚Äôd never do it üò≠"
Killer Ratings,"I don‚Äôt think equating Euphoria and Riverdale as teen dramas is very fair, Euphoria does a good job of depicting the teenage experience in relatively niche circumstances, just like The OC."
Killer Ratings,So iconic Jason Derulo had to sample it
Killer Ratings,"It‚Äôs a fantastic pilot. Sets up everything you need to know about the show in an organic way, and leaves you wanting more."
Killer Ratings,"Yeah wonderful pilot, Doug Liman did good stuff on that"
Killer Ratings,The pilot was great. The rest got dull very fast.
Killer Ratings,McG don't hold back
Killer Ratings,Neither ~~were~~ was remotely as good.
Killer Ratings,Phantom Planet!
Killer Ratings,"I was in the Army in 2007 and my unit was gearing up for our deployment. So everyone was in a ""lets enjoy some life before we might get killed"" kinda mood. My roommate asked me if id ever seen the OC, I said no. He had the complete dvd set, and over the next few days we watched all it. I'm sure there are plenty of other ""tough manly men"" who enjoyed it as well. I don't think it was really targeted solely at teenage girls either."
Killer Ratings,"Yeah I'm actually surprised it hasn't got a reboot, considering Gossip Girl got one. Maybe it's just a matter of time, but yeah it seems some of the original cast don't wanna do it. Rachel Bilson and Melinda Clarke seem down for it. Adam Brody and Ben Mackenzie not so much."
Killer Ratings,"reboots usually suck, if it's good you don't want them to reboot it"
Killer Ratings,Wasn't it the SNL skit that popularized it?
Killer Ratings,"""Welcome to the OC, bitch!"""
Killer Ratings,"Agreed, it may be the best pilot of all time for its genre"
Killer Ratings,McG held so far back he didn't actually direct any of it.
Killer Ratings,Chuck is better than The OC. I actually didnt even know they were created by the same person but I watched both.
Killer Ratings,"The SNL skit was parodying the OC because it was such a huge scene. The SNL skit expanded the audience I‚Äôm sure, but there were a lot of people watching the OC version already."
Killer Ratings,Well if you like it there are  23 seasons with between 4 and 8 episodes per season.
Killer Ratings,It's a shame that some of these shows don't have a bigger audience outside of the UK. There really is some good TV in our detective shows.
Killer Ratings,"Yeah I have to agree. Those are two of the very best episodes in the entire shows.

Overall I really like the show, but it did get a bit to tongue in cheek at some point."
Killer Ratings,"Wow. I like the show for very different reasons and enjoy it most when it's being tongue-in-cheek. My favorite episode is [s15e4 ""Death and the Divas""](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B018HCACK0/ref=atv_dp_season_select_s15) Because it's a love letter to Hammer films‚Äîand boy does that crew loooove Hammer films, they had so much fun making up their own‚Äîand it guest stars Sinead Cusack and Harriet Walter. And Harriet Walter is Christopher Lee's niece."
Killer Ratings,"I think it does, which is why both PBS(Friday nights) & Ovation(Mon thru Fri) air them"
Killer Ratings,"As a German who loves UK detective shows (Midsomer Murders is one of my favorite TV shows ever), it's sometimes really hard to watch them on stream. The last time I checked MM wasn't even streaming anywhere undubbed. I own some DVDs and had to resort to potatoe quality unpaid streaming sites to watch the rest of the episodes in English."
Killer Ratings,"Great show, horrifyingly brilliant performance from Hauser. Creeped me the fuck out."
Killer Ratings,Glad he got to say his lines quick enough.
Killer Ratings,Yeah it‚Äôs unbelievable.  When I realized he was Stingray from Cobra Kai I couldn‚Äôt comprehend it because I can‚Äôt stand him on that show.
Killer Ratings,"If you're an IASIP fan you'll also be pleased to know he was the juggalo kid from the storyline where Charlie becomes the janitor at the school. He's also very funny in I Think You Should Leave, and he really does love his wife."
Killer Ratings,My wife always says this in a high pitched voice when Blackbird is mentioned: ‚ÄúWhat do you do with the girls you go out with?‚Äù Fantastic show!
Killer Ratings,"Check him out in the movie Richard Jewell.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
Killer Ratings,Jamie Taco didn't have the right prison connections
Killer Ratings,Honestly I'm not even a lightweight but just the premise doesn't sound fun to watch imo. Sounds like it would just leave you feeling dark and depressed and not much else
Killer Ratings,But I‚Äôm not sure if we could call them ‚Äúrapists‚Äù per say? I mean Solange lead them on herself except may be the first murder.
Killer Ratings,"The impression I got for the first viewing was ""Natural Born Killers' True Romance"" But it is not as simple as that. It is much more profound. It is a tragedy for Adrien, but you will eventually understand the anger of Solange towards men. Unlike the girl in ""Dirty Weekend"", Solange had a lover to support her.  

I love all these twists as well. If you watch it 2nd or 3rd times, you will find more indications plotted in the earlier episodes. It is very well made. 

I loved the music in Albert memoirs and Nastya' art is just superb.  I love the club scene in particular Adrien listening to Albert recording in a kaleidoscope. The images are just beautiful:   the rusty films taken in 70's and actual story running, sunny summer and darks arts, the table scattered with colourful cereals, it is very powerful visually and musically.   

By the way, that actor who played young Albert resembles Marc Warren so much, doesn't he? I just thought he may be an illegitimate son of Marc Warren. But I found that Axel Granberger was Swedish x Monacan, he seems nothing to do with the blonde English actor with distinctively big blue eyes."
Killer Ratings,"Definitely agree with your sentiment. Just finished watching it, and I‚Äôm sooo disappointed by the direction taken from the end of the third episode onward‚Ä¶ there was a very interesting discourse about consent, men and violence, epigenetics are mentioned as well ‚Äî all thrown away after a couple episodes. The characters of Albert and Solange end up being so much more shallow than what they could have been, and Adrien is despicable all along. The whole tortured writer bit got old really quick. Genuinely infuriated right now ahah."
Killer Ratings,"Ok, I've watched a couple episode, I can't decide if I want to watch more (but there are only six).  There's too much that isn't the story of the old man.  The murders are so disturbing but also weirdly make you have no sympathy for the murdered.  

The second and third murders when you aren't sure if the girl is actually being raped or participating in the entire thing are facinating.  The acting with her peeking out of the corner of her eyes is something else.

I think they could reedit this series into a three episode show and it would be amazing."
Killer Ratings,Lol you couldn't be bothered to add a spoiler tag?
Killer Ratings,"Spoiler: he wasn‚Äôt a random police officer though, was he?"
Killer Ratings,Spoiler: if Catherine/Solange was the murderer all along then why did she leave Albert when she was pregnant? If he was such a good guy and she was the one who didn‚Äôt want to add a third person?
Killer Ratings,"This show was amazing! The twists were completely unexpected by me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Contrary to what others have said, I think it got better as it went on

Highly recommend to anyone who likes the psychological thriller/crime genre!"
Killer Ratings,"> But I‚Äôm not sure if we could call them ‚Äúrapists‚Äù per say?

If someone withdraws their consent and the person keeps going (especially aggressively so as we see in the show), that's rape. that person is a rapist."
Killer Ratings,"That‚Äôs why she left Albert knew she couldn‚Äôt be a mother. No one in this series do I like. No one from the family, their work colleagues, random strangers nor even the police. I didn‚Äôt like anyone‚Ä¶ they aren‚Äôt just good people that did bad things they are just all unlikeable"
Killer Ratings,"I also thoroughly enjoyed the show, to the point of reading what Reddit had to say about it.

From the first scene, you know what you're in for, it's going to be weird and dark, but really well done.

The acting was great, I really liked Niels Arestrup's portrait of the old man.

When I though the whole series would be about the couple's murders, the story line changed."
Killer Ratings,Yes you‚Äôre right. I was confused what was happening though. So she was leading them on purpose and then later withdrawing her consent? Just to see if they continued? And then get them killed? Was that how and why they did what they did?
Killer Ratings,"Yes, they even showed us a couple times where the man got to live because he stopped when she said stop.  

Those parts of the story were facinating.  Was she the one leading everything?  Was she mostly a victim.  How much of this was her."
Killer Ratings,"Yes. In her head it's probably all revenge for what happened to her growing up, and what happened to her on that beach. But later as you see, she gets a bit out of control because she enacts such behaviours towards another trauma. 

This part of the series is actually fantastic. Too bad it's fluffed up with so many other boring parts."
Killer Ratings,Well she definitely led the photographer guy on. She was actively and willingly kissing him.
Killer Ratings,Yeah Solange was such a deep character. So many layers to it. I‚Äôm glad they actually showed a relationship that is grey.
Killer Ratings,"Mm, you're still not getting it. Even if you're kissing someone if you change your mind and they won't stop then that is rape.  Kind of weird that you aren't getting that."
Killer Ratings,I got it lol I just pointed out that she started everything. She was into it as well. She only stopped because her boyfriend made her to stop. Especially the photographer guy. But yes most of other men were rapists
Killer Ratings,"This doesn‚Äôt excuse murdering him, but the photographer did actually attack her after she withdrew her consent. Maybe she was counting on it, fine, she definitely was with all the others, but he didn‚Äôt care when she clearly said no."
Killer Ratings,Oh May be I have missed that part
Killer Ratings,[deleted]
Killer Ratings,"I've added this to my list on netflix, hopefully get to check it out over the holiday break."
Killer Ratings,lol. you know i didn't even realized that joke could've been made here when i typed this.
Killer Ratings,"I wanted a few more scary scenes but in the end, it was wacky enough to be enjoyable."
Killer Ratings,I loved that show
Killer Ratings,"I got to work on that show for a few seasons as the background Casting director. It was a hard show, out of all the shows I worked on probably one of the most demanding, but also one of my favorites as well. The cast and entire crew were really great, and the show was done really well!"
Killer Ratings,"On a related note, here is some unsolicited advice. Don't play poker with Kathryn Morris.  You. Will. Lose."
Killer Ratings,"I loved that damn show and it was available for streaming for a while for free, I think in the Roku app. It has disappeared from view. 

I appreciated the way it always handled the LGBTQ storylines."
Killer Ratings,"I fucking love this show. It's the best of the Bruckheimer-verse, even superior to classic CSI (seasons 1-6). Without a doubt the music made this show, introduced me to so many amazing songs and the end of episode montages frequently got my tear ducts working."
Killer Ratings,"One of my favorite shows. All the seasons are on HBO max, currently binge watching."
Killer Ratings,Me and my wife used to love watching Cold Case. She always referred to Lilly Rush as Detective Pixie because of her haircut. I miss that show
Killer Ratings,"My wife and I binged it years back.  Kathryn Morris was a fantastic lead, and the music was used to perfection.  It's one show I'd actually like to see rebooted."
Killer Ratings,"Great show, unfortunately I used to watch it with my ex, I no longer watch it"
Killer Ratings,"Loved that show.

There was a network, possibly We TV or Oxygen, IDK, that had the reruns on in the afternoons.  I changed jobs so I'm no longer home that time of day, so IDK if it's still being shown.

It seems that [TNT](https://www.tntdrama.com/shows/cold-case-tnt) has it available,."
Killer Ratings,"I absolutely love this show and have even (at one point) made a list of the best episodes to watch. They were the best in my opinion, anyway."
Killer Ratings,I love watching Cold Case I started watching when it was on Ion now you can stream it on Roku and HBO Max
Killer Ratings,At some point it looked like every single TV actor was on Cold Case. Incredible casting and music. Loved that show so much .
Killer Ratings,I just love the music. Takes you back in time. I‚Äôm old enough to remember a lot of it
Killer Ratings,"I didn't have cable tv when I was younger, so that's how I became to know this show. I came to enjoy it quite a lot. Until this day, the episode that is ingrained in my memory is Daniela. I sometimes rewatch it on [soap2day.to](https://soap2day.to)"
Killer Ratings,Just came on Amazon Prime. Bingeing it right now.
Killer Ratings,"I thought the show was really well done but could not stand to watch it.  It's the only murder mystery I know of where the murder is a tragedy.  People are sad about it.  Very well done but just too depressing.

I watch light hearted murder mysteries where the victim is hated by everyone and no one is sad that they died."
Killer Ratings,It airs weekly on CHCH in Canada.
Killer Ratings,You can watch it on HBO max ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Killer Ratings,"Question, I just wastched the season 6-2 part episode. I don't understand the ending, did she hallucinate getting out of the water and the subsequent interrogation that followed?

How did the divers know where she went in?"
Killer Ratings,I just watched most of the first season!!!  Even better after 20 years
Killer Ratings,"The best of that show was how it dealt with hate crimes ... I have almost teared up so many times when it comes to like people being killed simply for what they are ...
The baseball kid who was killed for being gay 
That kid named Daniella/Edwin who killed herself because no one accepted her for who she was .
The black girl who was raped and murdered by the white supremist gang in which her lover was a part of ... 
These episodes were so sad ...
This is how you do sensitive topics not force them in your face like they do these days"
Killer Ratings,"I started watching this show after seeing recommendations on here and honestly, I'm not that impressed so far. The stories have been really basic and just no really that compelling and the montage at the end when the crime is solved, we see the flashbacks and the deceased person (sometimes with slo-mo) is just cheesy to me. And trust me, I'm not a prestige TV nut or anything that only watches masterpieces, maybe I just expected more based on the hype.

I like how ballsy the female lead is and the other characters are fine but you are definitely right about the lack of chemistry with her initial partner. She was trying but he was giving her nothing back in their scenes together, I'm glad he gets replaced. I'm only on Season 1, episode 3 so I'm assuming it gets much better. I will at least give it half a season since the whole season is like 23 episodes."
Killer Ratings,"Yes, I imagine this would be a tricky show to produce, given that nearly every episode is a period piece."
Killer Ratings,"The casting for that show was really something else, just like the music."
Killer Ratings,"I've never played poker, but I'll keep that in mind.

Fun fact: KM met her current partner Johnny Messner, when he showed up in the last few episodes playing an FBI agent who becomes a love interest for Lilly."
Killer Ratings,"""Forever Blue"" was considered one of the best episodes."
Killer Ratings,"Just FYI, it's currently streaming on HBO Max"
Killer Ratings,And hate crimes on Black people as well ...
When They See Us,Watch DARK with english subtitles (not dubs)- it's awesome...
When They See Us,[deleted]
When They See Us,What about Mindhunter?!
When They See Us,[deleted]
When They See Us,Thanks for reminding me of 'When They See Us'. Now I'm depressed and angry again.
When They See Us,I‚Äôm glad Umbrella Academy is mentioned in the article.
When They See Us,">The shows we invested heaviest in worked really well!

-Netflix, to naive investors."
When They See Us,"Netflix are good with PR, even their most mediocre stuff will get hyped up like hell."
When They See Us,"No mention of the Dark Crystal: AoE? Damn.

Really not optimistic about a season 2 announcement now :( Everyone give it a watch, it's well written and gorgeous to look at."
When They See Us,"Kinda confused about The Witcher since it came out within the final 2 weeks of the year, but ok."
When They See Us,"It makes me sad that a lot of people don't know that Dragon Prince exists

Edit: ok after seeing these replies, I should rephrase: people don't give the show a chance. Yeah, the animation is a little weird in season 1, but it wasn't that bad and the creators were trying something different and I can't knock them for trying. Since they're short seasons, you won't have to deal with the frame rate issues for too long and you might even get used to it after a few episodes in season 1."
When They See Us,When They See Us was incredible and important. Glad it did well.
When They See Us,"The Witcher is really good. I was not hyped when it was announced, but now I can't wait to see season 2."
When They See Us,"*Toss a view to your Witcher, oh valley of streaming*"
When They See Us,"I don't see why these articles about Netflix's shows keep getting posted over and over, they are literally meaningless. 

Until the data is public, Netflix can say anything they want. Take the Sandler/Anniston movie. The numbers the say are people who watched it two minutes. The trailer they auto play is 2:38 long. As far as we know they're including all of those autoplays. 

Whatever Netflix tells you shouldn't mean much."
When They See Us,I would‚Äôve expected Bojack Horseman to be somewhere in the top 10.
When They See Us,I tried to give Witcher a chance but for some reason couldn‚Äôt get into it
When They See Us,I would throw Haunting Hill House in there as well if people haven‚Äôt seen that.  Really good.  Still a shame that Santa Clarita got cancelled.  Was easily one of my favs.
When They See Us,I loved all these shows 'when they see us' made my friends cry.
When They See Us,And here I am finally seeing Daybreak and then finding out it literally got cancelled a few weeks ago.....
When They See Us,I can't get past the first 20 minutes of the witcher.
When They See Us,I was iffy on The Witcher but by the end I was fully invested. Finished so strong. Really hope season 2 is more than 8 episodes.
When They See Us,I thought Lucifer S4 had done really well for downloads. If that was true not sure why it's not mentioned?
When They See Us,I've never heard of When They See Us and I watch pretty much everything Netflix recommends to me. Curious about why Netflix didn't promote it to me.
When They See Us,I'm really worried Netflix is going to axe The Last Kingdom to focus all their investment in that type of show on The Witcher...
When They See Us,"I highly recommend ""when they see us""."
When They See Us,"I enjoy ST less every season. Loved S1, S2 was still good minus the weird emo shit. S3 so far is my least favorite. They got rid of a lot of that thick mystery that I loved S1 so much for."
When They See Us,I am only two episodes into The Witcher and I don't think I have the will to continue.
When They See Us,The witcher was awesome. By the last episode i wanted season 2 badly. The show has a really great vibe once you're invested.
When They See Us,"Why is 'When They See Us' listed in the headline?

It came in at #6 in a list of 10 originals."
When They See Us,Praise Geraldo!
When They See Us,"‚ÄúYou‚Äù is such an incredible show, shocked it isn‚Äôt mentioned in this thread once. I‚Äôve been through the second season twice"
When They See Us,"Nobody at work understands me and thinks im just being contrarian, but I do not enjoy the Witcher series. I watched maybe 4 or 5 episodes waiting for it to grab me but it‚Äôs just... boring. Nothing really happens and the characters dialogue is kinda stale and empty all the time. 

People compare it to GoT and thats why I watched it but it‚Äôs almost the antithesis of GoT. Only the sword play is better in the Witcher. Maybe its better than GoT season 8 but then again so is diphtheria."
When They See Us,The OA still being robbed
When They See Us,"As per usual, a complete lack of any tangible information from Netflix. Can anyone tell me what the point of upvoting this is?"
When They See Us,Missing is Lost in Space. Seriously a great show!
When They See Us,It‚Äôs interesting how the Witcher deals with timelines. I am about to finish it and I just found out about it.
When They See Us,I loved The Witcher and I don't care what anyone thinks.
When They See Us,[deleted]
When They See Us,I really wish I hadn't wasted my time with Stranger Things
When They See Us,The Politician?!?
When They See Us,‚ÄúWhen They See Us‚Äù was probably the last straw I had for trump. I thought he was a terrible president but at least he wouldn‚Äôt want to kill children. Then I watch the show and see him wanting the kids to get the death penalty with there being no proof or evidence of the kids committing the crime.
When They See Us,When They See Us was so good. Actor who played Korey Wise was amazing
When They See Us,The Witcher has only been about for 5 minutes that just goes to show how bloody lit it is. Can not believe there won‚Äôt be another season for well over a year though! Waa
When They See Us,[deleted]
When They See Us,Mindhunter and Dark are my two favorite shows on Netflix.
When They See Us,"The Witcher is an absolutely fascinating series.


I have never watched something so arguably good and terrible at the same time. The over-arching plot and universe is really interesting, but almost everything else is really bad. But I couldn‚Äôt stop watching the show, no matter how hard I was cringing at times.

I still can‚Äôt figure out if the way the show has been cut together, like the different timelines, is either absolutely brilliant or absolutely terrible."
When They See Us,I‚Äôm over stranger things. The hype around Mildred b brown is too much.
When They See Us,When they see us is so good and makes me so upset and sad
When They See Us,I like Netflix because not everything needs to be a 100/100 show.
When They See Us,More Netflix propaganda üò¥
When They See Us,The only reason people are finishing The Witcher is to try to figure out when the fuck what the fuck is happening.
When They See Us,Stranger things is poopy
When They See Us,"I really liked the witcher- It had some pretty big flaws but was really good. One of its major flaws will be gone next season where is was hard to follow which timeline they were in since there were 2-3 going on at once and it kept jumping around till it all came together.   AT least next season it looks like it is all one timeline and is on track to be one of those watching 2-3 different people in the SAME time line with different stories that all end up coming together into the same Act 3 Finale and each contributing differently to beating a big bad.

&#x200B;

The other flaw is the expositions - at times is coddles us to much with exposition and explanation and other times it completely devoid where it should be .

&#x200B;

But it nails the world - clearly done by people that have both read the books and played the game as there are things in the show that are unique to both .   Right now its a solid B+ but it really has the potential to be an all time great , and there are plenty of shows that didn't really blow up till season 2-3 especially when the series / seasons are short episodes runs like this"
When They See Us,What about Lost In Space.....y‚Äôall are missin out
When They See Us,"I truly enjoyed The Witcher. I didn‚Äôt have high hope, especially since the trailers were not very good IMO. But my wife and I binged it together in no time."
When They See Us,Witcher and Stranger Things are currently my 2nd and 3rd favorite shows on Netflix. Behind The Last Kingdom. But then it only became a Netflix original as of season 3.
When They See Us,u/weedmonkey666
When They See Us,wolf tickets
When They See Us,About add Messiah to 2020 most popular shows because that was awesome. A very wild ride.
When They See Us,"I‚Äôm an avid Netflix watcher and incredibly I‚Äôve never heard of that third one, is it US only?"
When They See Us,FUCK THE CRITICS! LAUNCH THE HACKS INTO ORBIT
When They See Us,Does it bother anyone else that the title of the article and the first line of the article are nearly identical except for a different third show behind stranger things and the Witcher?
When They See Us,"Try Rain on Netflix. I started watching it thinking it was the usual YA sci/fi show. I was unprepared for how amazing it is. I love when a show does that, it's such a great surprise."
When They See Us,Fuck
When They See Us,"The Witcher was fantastic, although been hard to convince friends to watch."
When They See Us,1/3 woke that's good
When They See Us,Love the witcher like for real..... destiny will always find a way...... u cant run from it.....üòäüòåüòå
When They See Us,I guess fantasy was in last year
When They See Us,When They See Us made me bawl my fucking eyes out
When They See Us,"Also, this just in: there is water at the bottom of the ocean"
When They See Us,Personally enjoyed Witcher way more than Mandalorian. It doesn't deserve the negative reviews it's getting
When They See Us,I think these are the only three new shows/seasons I watched on Netflix this year.
When They See Us,"But season 3 was a terrible mess. Steve and Dustin were great but the rest of the season sucked. Max was a annoying af trying to have adult relationships, nancy and her relationship with her stalker and peeping tom was really fucking creepy. Will was better when he was unconscious in the upside down. Erica was a BRAT omg she was probably the worst part of the whole season."
When They See Us,I hope we get to see more of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù Geralt and get to see more his investigative skills and Witcher sense at work.
When They See Us,Another day and another front page post about the witcher and netflix. I'm almost tired of the amount of astroturfing in this sub.
When They See Us,But it never becomes appointment television because it all drops at the same time
When They See Us,"Personally I just thought that When They See Us was ok. While the real life story and the real life context is extremely interesting and relevant, the show itself felt a bit flat to me (particularly in the later episodes). For a miniseries about discrimination and the problems in the American Justice system, I thought HBO's the Night Of was superior and far more nuanced in it's exploration, not to mention that I think the writing as a whole was much stronger for the Night Of."
When They See Us,where the fuck is Big Mouth?!
When They See Us,"Well netflix marketing is crazy, everyone in the world knows about Witcher is coming and there are 4-5 posts on this sub constantly mentioning it. I'd say they are more aggressive than Disney +."
When They See Us,"I have never been so impacted by a performance as I was by Korey Wise actor, Jharrel Jerome. Absolutely incredible."
When They See Us,What about Dark? That show is awesome!
When They See Us,"Haven‚Äôt seen Witcher, stranger things 3 was ok, by that I mean entertaining, when they see us was very good tho, made me cry and I‚Äôm not the type that cries during movies"
When They See Us,Hmm
When They See Us,"I view and browse Netflix and other streaming services quite regularly (total cord cutter) and I've never heard of When They See Us, is it any good?  No clue what it's even about"
When They See Us,The Witcher is psychotic
When They See Us,"No mention of The OA? 

Shafted once again..."
When They See Us,whats the witcher about? i want to know if i should drop everything and watch or is it not worth it?
When They See Us,Mediocrity reigns
When They See Us,First line says Umbrella Academy instead? wat?
When They See Us,Is the Witcher any good?
When They See Us,[deleted]
When They See Us,Why exactly don‚Äôt they just release the numbers? Witcher‚Äôs a massive hit so they must be pretty high. What‚Äôs the problem?
When They See Us,Really these 3? Meh... there‚Äôs better on Netflix...
When They See Us,"""When They See Us"" is vital television. Please watch it if you haven't already."
When They See Us,Sry but ST 3 sucks SO much...
When They See Us,[deleted]
When They See Us,Stranger Things may be the most overrated show this century
When They See Us,"Stranger Things for me went from ""god, this show is so cool"" to ""oh god, not these guys again"""
When They See Us,What about Raising Dion. Very underrated.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),First two episodes were quite entertaining. New guilty pleasure with only six episodes at 30 minutes.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),The genius Titzler strikes again.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),A wild Jonathan Frakes appears.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Loving it so far
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Why is Netflix using their shitty dub as the default?

Edit: are drugs decriminalized in Germany? D-bag ""only got caught with 4 pills"" and nothing happened. That's a felony in the US"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"This reminds me how little has changed from the late 80/90s.

Loved the show."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Loving it so far three episodes in, especially Dealer Buba and Lenny. 


I hope none of these characters make stupid decisions that ruin the show"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Does anyone know the You and Me sample from episode one? Not the flume remix
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Meh this show is pretty cheesy and the dub job is horrendous
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),ok then.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Download link pls
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),I couldn't decide between this or When They See Us.  Opted to burn through When They See Us since it's just four episodes and then give this show a shot.  I'm glad both are relatively short and not drawn out to ten episodes just for the heck of it.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"If you get caught with only a ""small"" amount, it's considered for your personal use and while not really legal (I think), they wont prosecute it."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Essentially, if you are of German nationality and get caught with a minor amount, nothing will happen. This is Europe, not the USA where you go to prison for weed"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"In addition to the rules about minor amounts, and I'm using the word 'rules' deliberately because it often isn't actually part of the law, there is another thing that helps Daniel in that situation. ¬ß31 of the german Bet√§ubungsmittelgesetz (narcotics law) enables you to recieve a lower penalty or have your case dropped entirely by providing information that's helpful in solving the case or preventing further drug related crimes (hence '31er' being used as the german equivalent for 'snitch'). Normally that decision is up to a court to make but with the pacing of the series it's understandable to not actually include that the way it's normally handled but rather just have the police not pursue the case against him in turn for him ratting out his supplier."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"In germany you get a criminal complaint. With 4 pills its very frequently, and usually there are no fines with this regard. Often dependents in which state u live. MDMA or ectasy is not legal in germany."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I watched with the original German audio, but when (minor cameo spoiler) [Spoiler](#s ""Jonathan Frakes"") shows up they for some reason dubbed him? Had to switch over to the English dub to get the original audio and then back again after."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"buba is played by the guy who did the Dwight Schrute character in the german version of the office

He's also consistently hilarious in everything else he appears in."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),It was the flume remix though...
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),So watch the original version and read subtitles.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Since its only 30 minutes each episode, i would have preferred 10-12 episodes"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"That's for weed. For pills etc. they'll absolutely fuck you up, speaking from experience. Also, you can kiss your driver's license goodbye, even when you're caught sober nowhere near a car."

That was on purpose. He was dubbed by Detlef Bierstedt who dubbed him before on Fact or Fiction. To a German viewer any other voice would seem off."

How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),It's a really good season!
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Released last year in July.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I really liked it as well. Some slick visuals, surprisingly realistic tech stuff, wacky side characters and not afraid of making the main character behave like an asshole sometimes (often)."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"What a great show. Netflix strategy of national productions is brilliant and has resulted in several gems.

I really would like them to pick up the fantastic **Ku'damm 56** series, playing in Berlin during the post WWII era and during the Cold War.

*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku%27damm_56

""Ku‚Äôdamm 56 is a German television trilogy about the 50s youth generation in the period between the end of World War II and the German Wirtschaftswunder.[1] It tells the story of a conservative mother and her three daughters of marriageable age. The setting is the family-owned dance school. The trilogy deals with prudish morality, the first sexual experiences of the young women, and the desire for values, underscored by the association with Nazi Germany of the mother and many of her contemporaries.[ ... ] In 2018, it was followed by a sequel mini-series, Ku'damm 59."""
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),keep meaning to start this show but always get side tracked.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Dude looks too old for high school but damn, his acting is good."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),This series is fantastic and has such a great humor
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Yes
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),great
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I hope s3 gets better. S2 was such a let down. Was hoping for more but nope, it never came."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"With the impresive results so far, I'll watch anything out of Germany. Ku'damm sounds great."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I haven't seen Ku'damm,  but I am still waiting for Deutschland '89.

Who is showing Deustchland '83 and '86 in your country?

Ku'damm is on Netflix in Germany"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"episodes are rather short, and only 6 episodes per season.  you can binge through it rather quickly"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Watch it. It's very funny.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"They're supposed to be in their final year so around 18-19 years old, most of the cast fits that age range pretty well, in most US shows you'll have high schoolers that are like 25+ in real life."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),I was pretty happy with  season 2.  What did you not like?
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"> Deustchland '83

In Germany Deutschland '83 and '89 were shown by RTL. Amazon is holding the online licences for Germany and Austria."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I just checked. He is 24, and she is almost 25.  first season was filmed two years ago though. So twentytoish."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Only 83 was on TV, as far as I know.  While RTL said they would air season 2, they never did."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),July 21 for those that dont want to watch the trailer
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Im so glad this got a second season, it's so good"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),I liked season 1. Looking forward to it
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),I love it!
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Bitcoin to the moon
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"If you have two hours to kill, I highly recommend this.

Also episode 2 (of S1 obviously) has a surprise cameo appearance"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Also says it in the description of the video on YouTube.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),who is it i dont remember
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Jonathan Frakes
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Good luck entering this show's title into a search engine.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),It's written by the great german writer Stefan Titze also known as B√∂hmermanns Wunderknabe. He is a Star Wars and Kratzeis enthusiast.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),I'm surprised there aren't more shows and movies about people who sling drugs on the Darknet. Lots of interesting stuff has happened over the years. 
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"hate this title, but trailer seems interesting. I'll give it a shot."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Well I know what I'll be watching on May 31st haha
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"That title card at the end reminds me of Love, Death and Robots."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),[deleted]
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I mean this seems like it's coming out a few years late. Dope came out in what, 2016? Same shit less topical. Still gonna watch it though. "
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Looks awful
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Based on one line in the show, that‚Äôs the joke."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Title so bad I don‚Äôt even want to watch the trailer. Bad move by Netflix. I only came into the comments to see if this thing was getting roasted.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),It's a series.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I thought Dope was a total joy to watch. Colorful, vibrant, funny. Then the last act happens, Blake from Workaholics shows up and it's utter trash."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),So brave. 
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),[deleted]
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"*hating something based on the trailer*: broke

*hating something based on the title*: ***WOKE***"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I looked it up on Netflix, and it said TV series."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),[deleted]
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I know sometimes they'll put ""Series"" in the trailer or ""All episodes on xx-date"", but I've noticed a lot of times recently they haven't."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"It premeired yesterday. It caught my attention.

It's on my list to check out same as Monarca"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Just to clarify, it‚Äôs a Mexican show, not a Spain one"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Cathedral of the Sea is one of their brilliant Spanish shows.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),I've been binge watching it for the past couple of days. I'm on episode 20 and it just keeps getting better.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"These kinds of shows give me so much adrenaline!! They are so good and I find all the characters very relatable. Truly an amazing work of art. Though, I think they give a wrong idea about illegal activities."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"For some reason I don‚Äôt quite  understand, HIgh Seas is one of my favorite shows..."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"I‚Äôm gonna need you to sell me on a non spoiling clip, takes a lot of hype for me to be into anything that isn‚Äôt football rn"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"The club, Netflix cheers.

What's the German show about? I don't want to Google it for fear of being on a list"
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"really? I couldn't pass the first episode. I was just laughing at the story and how bad the acting was, I mean it was terrible. Nothing made me keep watching."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"It‚Äôs not a great show, it‚Äôs more a show to have on as the background while you‚Äôre cleaning or having on while being on reddit. Acting can be over the top, typical mexican telenovela type. Im on episode 6, because my PS4 is at my bfs and i have nothing else to watch. It‚Äôs not really attention grabbing and generic storyline so far."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Just finished it and it was really good! That ending was insane.
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"The overall plot arch is good, the actors are fantastic, and production value is on point.

However, the storyline is sloppy as hell. In at least one episode scenes were edited in out of order, and otherwise there isn't a lot of coherence scene-to-scene, and there is a supreme lack of character development.

It has potential though."
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),Monarca is amazing
How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast),"Ah, it is? I was wondering why the accents sounded different. Thank you, I'll edited the post"
Charmed,"> Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Rose McGowen and more of the original cast of Charmed are reuniting at '90s Con 2023"
Charmed,"For a second I thought it meant Shannon Doherty and Alysa Milano might have made up.

But I guess not. Since Alysa Milano won‚Äôt be there."
Charmed,I'm actually surprised Shannon is going considering she's battling Stage 4 cancer at the moment
Charmed,[removed]
Charmed,Lmao they couldn‚Äôt even spell rose mcgowan‚Äôs name right
Charmed,What happened with them. I wasn‚Äôt actively on the internet back then so I had no idea why they wrote Prue off.
Charmed,"It's been around 4 years since her stage 4 diagnosis, so I guess she's recovering pretty well"
Charmed,There's roughly two billion people more annoying than her.
Charmed,Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôre not inviting little dweebs like you to their reunion party.
Charmed,No one can agree on the details. Just that Shannon Doherty and Alysa Milano couldn‚Äôt stand each other. Some say Doherty was jealous of Milano. Some say Doherty‚Äôs attitude made her difficult to work with. If you asked either of them they probably don‚Äôt even remember the reasons.
Charmed,"Make sense as Alyssa and Rose McGowan supposedly don't get along either.

Not to say Alyssa is the common variable. Shannon had a reputation since 90210. Rose seems nuts nowadays, but being raped by Harvey Weinstein, dating Marilyn Manson, and being in a car accident that messed her face up will probably do that."
Charmed,"‚ÄúCW cancels 7 shows,‚Äù and promptly names six ‚Äú‚Ä¶and more.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the Dark.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn the Dark‚Äù was the ‚Äúmore.‚Äù  This isn‚Äôt the black-and-white season of ‚ÄúGilligan‚Äôs Island.‚Äù  Hope I saved someone a click."
Charmed,And yet Riverdale lives
Charmed,"Am I having a time travel stroke? Charmed, Roswell, and the 4400 have been canceled for a long time."
Charmed,Whatever happened to the 100 prequel?
Charmed,Charmed?  Dynasty?  What year is this?
Charmed,"What sucks is, the CW heads knew this going out of business was happening and they didn't give all these productions a heads up(well sans the ones that were in a first season). 

So many unconcluded shows."
Charmed,Feeling thankful we got long runs and proper endings for Crazy Ex Girlfriend and Jane the Virgin
Charmed,They really did a bad job with promoting. I loved the original 4400 and did not even know it had a remake.
Charmed,"I bet they bring back ""Cheaters"""
Charmed,"They do desperately need some quality control. I'm still amazed 'All American' is not only alive but has a spinoff, the show was dead in the water during its freshman run, no one was watching but that Netflix deal was worth its weight in gold for CW shows."
Charmed,What year is it??
Charmed,Im sad. Dynasty was my guilty pleasure show üò≠
Charmed,"Amazing what happens when all of a sudden the parent companies say ""Look, we are going to sell this shit, we are done with a network that loses money every year since it's founding""."
Charmed,"Honestly surprised Legacies got cancelled, it always seemed to be doing well and had the built in... legacy. Naomi is not at all a surprise. In the Dark was great in season 1 but season 2 was meh and season 3 was a steep decline into crap and they wrote themselves into a corner with it. I'm surprised it even got the upcoming season. I had a bunch of shows from CW I watched but now that's down to 4 and with In The Dark not continuing past the upcoming season, that makes 3... and honestly I'm not expecting The Flash to last after next season either. Superman and Lois and Stargirl seem most likely to just move to HBO Max if they have to."
Charmed,When all these cancellations are done every network is just gonna be reality TV and shows that pretend cops are heroes.
Charmed,Really CW needs to cancel their entire lineup and try again.
Charmed,I sometimes catch the end of some of CW‚Äôs shows as my local affiliate airs Seinfeld at 10:00 every night. Most of what the CW airs during the 9:00 hour is fucked up.
Charmed,I actually liked Roswell. Bummed about that.
Charmed,The only show I care about from this list is Legacies. My daughter and I's favorite show to watch together. The show was so fun with the monster of the week vibe. And they took their time to explore the dynamics between all the different characters really well.
Charmed,"As much as this upsets the 5 people that watched those shows, this was a good day at The CW.

I loved both The Vampire Diaries and The Originals and I really wanted to like Legacies, however it just simply wasn't good. I do think Danielle Rose Russell is actually a good actress and I'm interested in seeing in where she goes from here, however Legacies just had some of the cringiest writing."
Charmed,Streaming deals and international sales were the only thing really keeping half CW's line up afloat. The Network had been bleeding money for years
Charmed,"As long as they keep Whose line, they can do whatever they want"
Charmed,The Charmed remake was fucking awful anyways. Good riddance.
Charmed,So I guess the Babylon 5 reboot is dead then... damn.
Charmed,Supernatural was too good for that network
Charmed,"Roswell is still going? Well, was"
Charmed,Only way to recoup loses is to merge all the shows into a magic alien teen mystery drama.
Charmed,Babylon 5 dodged a bullet.
Charmed,"I saw the showrunner for Roswell on twitter saying it got cancelled because of ‚Äúnew conservative ownership‚Äù which is a hell of a reach. Obviously with the transition of power a lot of heads would roll. Admittedly these are more heads than expected but it‚Äôs absolutely not a political decision, it‚Äôs a business one. Also the network will still have shows next year featuring non-white casts, female leads and LGBTQ+ characters. They‚Äôre arguably still the most diverse major network"
Charmed,"I‚Äôm not surprised Legacies was cancelled. 

The show has always been a shit show but it somehow got worse after Kaylee Braynt left. 

They took TVD and turned into whatever the fuck this was

The sad part is that it could have been good if they actually focused on the trio. The actual leads of the show. Instead they focused on literally anyone but Hope, Josie and Lizzie. 

It was weird. They kept trying too hard and not trying at all. 

And the writers of the show actually blamed the fans for not liking their shit writing. It wasn‚Äôt the standard ‚ÄúFans just don‚Äôt like it‚Äù shit it was ‚ÄúFans should be happy with our badly written queer rep!‚Äù"
Charmed,What about ‚ÄúWhose line?‚Äù
Charmed,"My theory: WB will start airing (formatted for cable/censored when necessary) versions of HBO Max shows‚Äô first seasons once the shows enter their third seasons, similar to what CBS has done with CBS All Access (or whatever it‚Äôs called now)"
Charmed,"I sort of started giving up on the network after Frequency and No Tomorrow were cancelled years ago. What I did appreciate for those shows was that an epilogue was produced for them after the cancellation news at least. 

Still '16-17 was a decent year for them for me at least. I was enjoying iZombie still, Legends of Tomorrow begun with its insanity and I liked Containment. Still after so long it is hard to not to try avoid shows that look like they won't last so you can avoid investing the time. So I didn't touch any of these cancelled shows luckily but I'm saddened for those who enjoyed any of them. It always sucks. The only ones I keep up with are Kung Fu and Stargirl so for now I'm safe. And I only started those after the renewed news."
Charmed,As a major charmed fan back in the day. The reboot was trash. Absolute garbage.
Charmed,"I have to ask, how does Flash keep surviving the cut? I stopped watching after the fourth season. Lol, more power to them I guess. I'm sure everyone employed on that show is happy."
Charmed,[deleted]
Charmed,About time someone told the CW their shows aren‚Äôt good.
Charmed,"Aw I fucking loved ""more"""
Charmed,A lot of good looking but completely talentless actors just lost jobs.
Charmed,*Superman and Lois* continues to survive. Thank fuck.
Charmed,Also not sure how Nancy Drew survived ? Great if not amazing edge of your seat first season into crappiest show on TV.
Charmed,Well I'm done with The CW .They can crash and burn like they eventually will.
Charmed,Only reason I ever watched the CW was for Supernatural and that boat has already burned and sank so I guess I'm all good with them cancelling all this garbage
Charmed,I've wanted a CW bloodbath for years and now that's it's finally here I can hardly contain myself.
Charmed,"To be fair, they all did fucking suck."
Charmed,"Mostly surprised the CW didn't give Legacies a wrap up season...the Vampire Diaries universe had been a hit for them for over a decade, hardcore business to just shut it down like that."
Charmed,"Hopefully this means we‚Äôll still be able to see that reportedly FANTASTIC live-action Power Puff Girls show! It was supposed to be so good, they had to make another pilot and lost one of the actresses! I‚Äôm sure they know what they‚Äôre doing!"
Charmed,didn't even know there was a new 4400. maybe CW should work more on promotions
Charmed,this really sucks for people that watched these shows and probably assumed they'd get an ending if their show was cancelled
Charmed,My boyfriend watches Legacies and Charmed on a heavy rotation ‚Ä¶. I am so happy and relieved I will not have to see these shows ever again.
Charmed,maybe they'll start making good shows. Probably not though
Charmed,"This housecleaning has to do with a pending sale of the network. Nexstar Media, the company most mentioned as a buyer, owns the ABC & Fox affiliates in my area. Now, they want to be major players. Naomi getting cancelled sucks, of course. Legacies waving bye-bye spells the end, it seems, for series adapted from the Vampire Diaries novels."
Charmed,"The problem is, relatively compared to 10 years ago. No on watches cable tv anymore. And when they do, its not CW. My wife watches legacies, thats about it. And only on Netflix."
Charmed,These shows were still on?
Charmed,"Charmed, 4400 and Naomi were pretty bad. Rest had low viewership numbers. They cancelled few shows in last couple of months and sometimes it seems so random. The Legends of tomorrow are in top ten of viewership and got canned. Riverdale is almost last and got renewed. Weird"
Charmed,Still sad Legends of Tomorrow didn‚Äôt get a final season
Charmed,It needed to be done.  There is a massive difference in quality from superman and lois compared to the rest of these shows.
Charmed,"4400 is still around?

I gotta say, I cannot name a single show on CW."
Charmed,Why does the CW still exist? Everything on there is absolutely horrible. I literally had to pry my eyes open to finish the last supernatural season.
Charmed,"oh noes, I was watching all those! /s"
Charmed,4400 cancelled is good news. The show is shit.
Charmed,"I didn't even know Naomi had premiered. Not that I was super interested in watching it, but I am interested in Du Vernay getting more projects so I'd been rooting for something akin to a hit."
Charmed,There are just some remakes that deserved better than CW...
Charmed,Starting to see this a lot and it‚Äôs been happening on Netflix for a while now. All these shows have one thing in common. They appeal to the woke.
Charmed,Better cancel the entire network altogether
Charmed,"I am so bummed to hear this, I actually liked Naomi and 4400 a lot. After Supernatural ended I thought I'd never watch anything on CW again. Well I watch the reboot of Walker, but that's only because Jared and their grandfather from Supernatural are in it. But yeah I came across those two shoes and I thought ""maybe there's life after Sam and Dean here."" But sadly no....what makes it suck even worse both shows ended on a major cliffhanger... It's too early to be so annoyed by something."
Charmed,Roswell and 4400 were still going?
Charmed,Wtf? Hasn‚Äôt the 4400 been canceled for years already? We got a fat cliffhanger at the end of season 3 or 4.
Charmed,*Damn.* and Naomi just started.
Charmed,"After the turd that has been the Flash this season, how bad do these shows have to be to get killed? Trump‚Äôs staff showed more competency than the writers of the Flash have."
Charmed,They didn‚Äôt cancel wheel of time then?
Charmed,I‚Äôd be pissed if they cancelled Nancy drew
Charmed,THAAAAAANK YOU. ALL those shows suck
Charmed,"Considering im pretty sure basically no one has heard of any of these shows, probably the right call unfortunately for the fans and casts"
Charmed,"Just cancel the damn channel, they produce nothing but shit."
Charmed,I haven‚Äôt even heard of any of those shows
Charmed,I‚Äôve never heard of any of these shows.
Charmed,why does this fills me with so much joy.
Charmed,What is CW?
Charmed,"Ain't this to do with CW's sale/change of owners?  
New owners don't have the funds to keep all these shows going, so CW's lightening the balance sheet and keeping only a few titles."
Charmed,"It has too because its being sold, all the DC show swill be axes also. Except maybe lois and clark and star girl ,as they may be moved to max. As WB is done with the CW DC universe."
Charmed,"Most of these were not a surprise, but the bigger shockers were Legends, In the Dark and Naomi."
Charmed,[OH no.gif](https://imgur.com/gallery/pSfeUk4)
Charmed,Good
Charmed,Ngl...never heard of any of these
Charmed,all i care is that they keep kung fu and nancy drew shows alive...
Charmed,what year is this?
Charmed,"Wait, I keep being told cancellation is a phenomenon unique to Netflix."
Charmed,Are you serious üòÆüòÆ Naomi & Legacies our the ONLY two good shows üíØüòí If they cancel ‚ùå those shows they might as well cancel the whole CW every other show is ‚ôªÔ∏è  THAT'S MY OPINION üíØ
Historical Roasts,"Seems like a cringe fiesta, but I am always happy to see Jeff Ross"
Historical Roasts,Release Date: May 27
Historical Roasts,I thought the episode on MLK was the best.
Historical Roasts,Agreed! It was really funny and the mlk speech at the end was actually pretty decent while also still being funny
Historical Roasts,There was a girl in the audience they kept panning back to who looked familiar. Anyone know who that was?
La Luna Sangre,But are they going to have naked towel slap fights in the locker room?
La Luna Sangre,"My boys!!!!!!

Mexican pride in Hollywood bitches!!!!‚úäüèæüá≤üáΩüá≤üáΩ"
La Luna Sangre,These guys really helped me start to appreciate foreign cinema in my early twenties and it's always great seeing them together again
La Luna Sangre,"Another spicy threesome scene, please"
La Luna Sangre,I directed Gael once for some online content for Gillette. Very nice man.
La Luna Sangre,love these guys. Maybe it's gonna be interesting
La Luna Sangre,"Te boxeo el culo, wey."
La Luna Sangre,Damn a lot of people still watch GOT
La Luna Sangre,Poland with Trailer Park Boys in the top 10 lmao
La Luna Sangre,"Hey FYI  - the French show ""The Bureau"" is by FAR the best espionage/spy/thriller TV show out there. Makes shows like Homeland look amateurish. I would highly recommend it."
La Luna Sangre,I'm glad to see that *Dead to Me* made the list.
La Luna Sangre,Surprised Dark isn't on here. Most overlooked show of all time.
La Luna Sangre,"This is fun, would be fun to see this every month (or if you could do it, make a site that automatically updates  each day)"
La Luna Sangre,[deleted]

VIVA LA MERDA"
La Luna Sangre,"Wow, ""Hollywood"" so high. Too be fair the first episodes were interesting but then it turned to a cringey cheesefest if there ever was one."
La Luna Sangre,"Damn feel like I really need to watch Money Heist now. Happy to see The Last Kingdom on that list, it‚Äôs such a good show."
La Luna Sangre,"I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
La Luna Sangre,"Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
La Luna Sangre,Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
La Luna Sangre,"Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
La Luna Sangre,Never heard of Money Heist
La Luna Sangre,"Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
La Luna Sangre,Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
La Luna Sangre,"Well now I‚Äôm intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
La Luna Sangre,"Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."
La Luna Sangre,Dark is on there for Germany.
La Luna Sangre,You are welcome :) [https://wikirank.net/#tvseries](https://wikirank.net/#tvseries)
La Luna Sangre,"Thanks, we plan to prepare detailed description in the next research and submit the paper to scientific conference/journal soon.  On the other hand, if some of ""overclockers"" will known how we do that, they will prepare additional ""cheat codes"" ;)"
La Luna Sangre,"That link took me to some alternate world where Wikipedia ain‚Äôt in American, I dint like it."
La Luna Sangre,you should look it up on wikipedia
La Luna Sangre,"reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
La Luna Sangre,"That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
La Luna Sangre,"I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
La Luna Sangre,"Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
La Luna Sangre,It‚Äôs by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it‚Äôs great. Ultra realistic
La Luna Sangre,"I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
La Luna Sangre,Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
La Luna Sangre,What movie? There is only the animated series.
La Luna Sangre,Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
La Luna Sangre,"Do it, you won‚Äôt regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I‚Äôve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can‚Äôt compare right now."
La Luna Sangre,"Not every show has to be the most original thing ever, but *Feel Good* is hardly derivative. It feels fresh to me. E.g. its specific, not-just-a-coming-out-story, take on queerness. What it's saying about friendship.

But regardless of what the show's influences are, it's just a good show. *Bosch* is a really good detective show, do we ding it for being a detective show? No, I'd say we celebrate it for that. (Not to say *Feel Good* is playing in any genre close to as solidified as the detective one.)"
La Luna Sangre,"I agree that it's starting to feel like a bit of it's own genre at this point but Feel Good is really good. But look at another Netflix series, Gypsy. Also trying to fit into that ""genre"" and missing the mark by a wide margin. 

In other words, yeah I guess, but it's still great TV. Like every genre, there's good and bad. No sweat"
La Luna Sangre,"It all depends on how engaging it is to the individual. *Love* certainly fits in to your guidelines but I loved every moment. I was bored with *Lovesick* by the end of the first season and bored with *Flaked* by the first episode. *You're the Worst* kinda fits the mould as well even with standout episodes like the PTSD one.

More and more series feel generic or recycled probably because we have more of, and better access to, them. The more deconstruction that takes place in criticism, the more holes appear. I can never remember which is which between *Spin City* and *Just Shoot Me.* *McHale's Navy,* *Dad's Army,* *Hogan's Heroes.* Hell if I know them apart.

A lot of shows used to just be good enough. Shite like *EastEnders* got watched because it was either that or a *Crystal Maze* rerun. *Feel Good* may turn out to be above average, but I tend to treat just about every new show with a sense of pessimism because there's no longer any need to waste valuable time on ""good enough."" That said, Mae Martin has some good stand-up and I wish her all the best."
La Luna Sangre,I also noticed a small nod to Dexter in Wolverine where for a while Logan was in hiding as a lumberjack.
La Luna Sangre,Explain 
La Luna Sangre,Kek
