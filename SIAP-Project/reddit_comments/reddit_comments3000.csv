TV Show,Comment
Fated to Love You,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Fated to Love You,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Fated to Love You,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Fated to Love You,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Fated to Love You,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Fated to Love You,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Fated to Love You,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Fated to Love You,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Fated to Love You,[deleted]
Fated to Love You,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Fated to Love You,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Fated to Love You,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Fated to Love You,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Fated to Love You,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Fated to Love You,Travelers is a good time travel show
Fated to Love You,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Fated to Love You,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Fated to Love You,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Fated to Love You,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Fated to Love You,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Fated to Love You,Love this show so much.
Fated to Love You,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Fated to Love You,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Fated to Love You,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Fated to Love You,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Fated to Love You,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Fated to Love You,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Fated to Love You,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Fated to Love You,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Fated to Love You,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Fated to Love You,"great show
always recommend it"
Fated to Love You,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Fated to Love You,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Fated to Love You,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Fated to Love You,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Fated to Love You,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Fated to Love You,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Fated to Love You,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Fated to Love You,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Fated to Love You,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Fated to Love You,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Fated to Love You,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Fated to Love You,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Fated to Love You,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Fated to Love You,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Fated to Love You,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Fated to Love You,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Fated to Love You,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Fated to Love You,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Fated to Love You,Someone must have never seen futurama
Fated to Love You,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Fated to Love You,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Fated to Love You,I think Dark has something to say about this
Fated to Love You,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Fated to Love You,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Fated to Love You,Good summer binge show
Fated to Love You,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Fated to Love You,[deleted]
Fated to Love You,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Fated to Love You,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Fated to Love You,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Fated to Love You,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Fated to Love You,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Fated to Love You,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Fated to Love You,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Fated to Love You,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Fated to Love You,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Fated to Love You,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Fated to Love You,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
Fated to Love You,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Fated to Love You,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Fated to Love You,Very nice
Fated to Love You,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
Fated to Love You,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Fated to Love You,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Fated to Love You,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Fated to Love You,Dude spoiler!
Fated to Love You,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Fated to Love You,Upgrade!
Fated to Love You,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
Fated to Love You,Shame about *The Rig*.
Fated to Love You,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Fated to Love You,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Fated to Love You,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Fated to Love You,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Fated to Love You,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
Fated to Love You,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I’m 4 episodes in now and I’m loving it.
Fated to Love You,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
Fated to Love You,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
Fated to Love You,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
Fated to Love You,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
Fated to Love You,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.
Fated to Love You,[deleted]
Fated to Love You,"ok, this convinced me to watch it. The movie was ok, not bad but not great as well. Probably the reason why I didn't want to watch the show. I will give it a shot."
Fated to Love You,Is there a place to watch it streaming right now?
Fated to Love You,I think I’ll watch it based on this comment thank you. Same level as dark and mr robot? Sign me up!
Fated to Love You,"Do I need to have seen the movie to enjoy the tv show?

Edit: having discovered the magicians a year or so ago I have changed my tune on syfy shows and am willing to give them a couple episodes of viewing and judge them on their merits. I was definitely one of those “2s” not too long ago"
Fated to Love You,So I read this comment a few days ago and decided to give it a shot because I love breaking bad and better call saul. The plot seems very cool and I love some good time travels stories but the writing is lazy. How many times are they going to have a bad guy at gun point only to hesitate shooting so an explosion can go off and they can escape. It's happened so much that I had to find this comment and say thank you for the recommendation because I am enjoying the show but I can't even begin to put it on the same level as BCS or breaking bad.
Fated to Love You,Legion comes to mind.
Fated to Love You,Interesting to me that you felt they added filler in those seasons. Season 3 and 4 were mapped out from start to finish after season 2 so everything was planned out. I guess I can understand some instances but at that point the show was just having so much fun I didn't care in the slightest.

My question is, I assume there's more to getting into character than just knowing how they sound. What is your experience when getting into character?

I remember how as a little girl, I always saw myself in Bubbles due to her sensitivity towards the world and her large creativity. Even now, I find myself relating to your other characters such as Raven from both, Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, as well as Twilight Sparkle from My Little Pony FiM. 

**Out of all the many characters you’ve voiced, both recent and past, who’s the one you most identify with? And who’s the one you least identify with?

As it enters its eighth season, MLP now ranks as one of your longest-running projects. What is it like to work on such a long-running project? 

As the show and characters have evolved over the years - Twilight, for instance, being much more prone to snark in earlier seasons - has your experienced changed as well? As you were originally approached for the role by Lauren Faust, was your experience different after she departed the show?"
The Fairly OddParents,"Hi Tara, thanks again for stopping by!

So did you see the Death Battle between Raven and Twilight? I was a little disappointed, though not surprised, that they didn't get you to do the voices, but I suppose that would have been problematic with contracts and whatnot.

Who were you rooting for?"

The amount of media students are increasing astronomically and I feel like there's a ton of competition now!

**My question is:** How did you start your career in voice acting?

Also, the new Powerpuff Girls isn't the same without you and the others. I can't even begin to describe how bummed I was when I found out they went in a completely new direction with the reboot."

The Fairly OddParents,"Do you approach voicing Twilight Sparkle and Sci-Twi differently?  One of EQD's most fascinating aspects is the different paths the doubles have taken, and I wonder if that's reflected in your performance or not.

It feels like a lot of projects you do are long lasting.  Timmy, Raven, Twilight, do you have anything new happening soon?

Any recent roles you've taken that made you stretch your legs and try different things, say the way you had to for Raven?

Edit:  I guess UniKitty is soon, but I was wondering about anything announced that's not airing yet, or maybe in theaters or video games."

Transformers Prime,"I watched the new Transformers series on Netflix this weekend. It was mighty dark. It seems to be a prelude to the G1 series, so maybe it will be on Earth next? 

Great animation, very high quality. Didn't love the story. Loved the inclusion of the big bots like Omega Supreme.

Transformers Prime,Prime/Beast Hunters is the most watchable Transformers series since G1.  I loved the designs.
Transformers Prime,Best Transformers adaptation ever made
Transformers Prime,"Sooo Megatron(us) is just a wrestler who somehow gained a political following and is now pissed he couldn't smackdown his way to the white house

And as we already knew Optimus is really just an all around nice guy"
Transformers Prime,Is that promo for some show?
Transformers Prime,"Holy shit, Star Trek Alien Typecast #3 was in Transformers?"
Transformers Prime,"It's most likely because the movies are made by people that don't really understand the franchise or they loosely take bits and pieces from it. They'll read a summary of Optimus Prime and make their own murderous version of him. 

Just like how the live action Dragon Ball movie was a pile of dogshit that didn't have much to do with the original series. With people that understand the franchise, I could totally see a movie in that universe work. Especially in an era now where we see how things like Guardians of the Galaxy work pretty well. I mean, that franchise has a talking raccoon in it and it works."
Transformers Prime,Or coherent robot designs. Everyone looked like very realistic identical grey tornadoes made of metal.
Transformers Prime,I liked the first transformers.....
Transformers Prime,"The Bay films are weak for many reasons but one of the big killers is that it somehow takes itself too seriously while also almost being a parody and having complete disinterest in respecting the source material or property as a whole. It will both sit there and drone on and on about it's backstory and lore dead pan expecting to be taken seriously and then will have illiterate racist stereotype transformers, transformers with balls or other stupid shit. It somehow manages to take itself too seriously and not seriously enough. It wants to be laughed at as as a stupid cartoon adaption about robot cars and also talk about ancient wars and chosen ones. Its such a half measure on all counts no one wins.

When adapting something like this you can go the  starsky and hutch route or the Miami Vice route. The Starsky and Hutch movie was a parody. A complete odd couple police comedy. Miami Vice was played 100% straight as a modern adaptation that tried to be an action crime thriller that I don't think had a single joke in it. Transformers wants to be both and it fails at it."
Transformers Prime,The only pro the Bay films gave was rejuvenating the Transformers franchise and making way for shows like this. Even Transformers Animated before this was pretty cool.
Transformers Prime,"> I watched the new Transformers series on Netflix this weekend. It was mighty dark. It seems to be a prelude to the G1 series, so maybe it will be on Earth next? 

If it follows the toyline (which is a safe bet), then Siege will be followed by Earth Rise. The toys have Earth vehicle alt modes, so something tells me it will be on Earth :)

Third part of the trilogy is Kingdom which [Spoiler](#s ""will have some time travel shenanigans"")

> Great animation, very high quality. Didn't love the story. Loved the inclusion of the big bots like Omega Supreme. 

They really needed to tighten up the writing and have a bit more time allotted. Six 20-something minute episodes was way too short for the story they were trying to tell. I'm really hoping they do better the next season, as I think that this series shows promise despite its heavy flaws."
Transformers Prime,"The bit where megatron throws two mooks off of his ship to go after the heroes, and one transformed into a car..."
Transformers Prime,"My favourite Starscream. He has a full arc, great interactions with both sides, and fabulous stilettos. A+ show."
Transformers Prime,"I have to agree. Haven't watched every TF series or movie, but out of the ones I've watched it's easily the best.

The ones I've watched: the old school version, Beast Wars (loved it), Transformers Armada, the live action movies and Prime."
Transformers Prime,"Megatron was a champion of the lower class, fighting against the corrupt establishment.  The establishment, as a political ploy, put a genuinely good dude in a mostly ceremonial position of power.  Then Megatron murdered the establishment.  

Megatron went from clearly the good guy to both sides being fucky to clearly the bad guy.  But it took a very long time to get there."
Transformers Prime,It's a flashback (backstory) within the animated series Transformers Prime.
Transformers Prime,"I always have a blast watching the first one. The rest of the Shia movies are bleh but they’re stimulating background noise features, and while the Wahlberg flick I did catch didn’t do it for me I still do like Bay’s (or at least his VFX teams’) capability to deliver insane spectacle on a massive scope."
Transformers Prime,"https://youtu.be/rPL73LBMc5A

The show has a few funny bits like this"
Transformers Prime,"He’s easily one of the best versions of Starscream.

They do a good job at showing both his strengths and weaknesses. He’s very intimidating and deadly whilst also being used for comic relief without one affecting the other."
Transformers Prime,Shia Laboeuf's grandpa should have left that fucker in the ice
Transformers Prime,Can you please tell me where to start on modern Transformers cartoons? I last watched cartoon transformers in the late 80s/early 90s and I'm sure those have been surpassed now.
Transformers Prime,I would try either this or Transformers: Armada. Also check out Beast Wars if you haven’t seen that one.
Transformers Prime,"Well, the films don't exactly set a high bar..."
Transformers Prime,"And yet it has the same issues: constant focus on a bunch of nonessential humans instead of the titular transforming robots, designs so scared of being boxy they end up being some arbitrary organic alien hodgepodge, Peter Cullen phoning it in as Optimus with none of the swagger from the G1 days and none of the gravitas he managed for maybe the first movie, and literally the same pack of uninspired writers at the helm as the movies.

Also, they had no conception of focus or pacing. ""Let's build up the star saber as this massive important artifact, and then - oh, wait, two episodes later we're moving on to a different plot."" ""Oh, Unicron is a pretty big deal - oh wait, he's not really that big a deal, what is Miko up to?""

If you want dramatic, go watch Beast Wars or Beast Machines. If you want campy, go for G1. If you want something in between, go for Animated. But Transformers Prime occupies a space in quality somewhere around Transformers Armada or Transformers Energon - not offensively bad, just not really worth much more than a cursory examination. Sure, it's better than the films, but they really aren't worth watching once, so where does that leave us?"
Transformers Prime,"IDW's More Then Meets The Eye and Robots In Disguise show how good the franchise can be. Political, funny, good storytelling and rounded characters. Too adult for the movie franchise to ever take a look at i'm afraid."
Transformers Prime,And Beast Wars is better than Transformers Prime
Transformers Prime,"And of course once they realized they had a popular animated series on their hands, with steady ratings and a large demographic fanbase of boys and girls...  they cancelled it and replaced it with [a new one that's been dumbed-down and solely devoted to selling toys for MALE VIEWERS ONLY](http://variety.com/2014/tv/news/hasbro-to-launch-transformers-robots-in-disguise-series-in-spring-2015-exclusive-1201219103/)"
Transformers Prime,watching grass grow is better than any of the films
Transformers Prime,"I've never understood the thing about the humans. The humans have been in nearly EVERY SINGLE SERIES. Except for Beast Wars, and even then, the proto-humans were a major plot point. Would I like a series that was human-less, like the games? Sure, but I don't mind the focus on the humans since they've been there since G1."
Transformers Prime,"Woah, I contest your inclusion of Armada in your ""meh"" list because it had the most solid Unicron plot of any series beyond G1. I mean it was painfully silly at times but when they got down to the brass tacks of lore and world expansion they nailed it. For me, there is a lot of value in that. "
Transformers Prime,Beast Wars is better than 99% of things in life.
Transformers Prime,"To be fair, the art style for Robots in Disguise looks insanely similar to Transformers Animated, which was a phenomenal series. Maybe RiD will have similar writing too?"
Transformers Prime,"I'm certainly not saying that there need to be no humans, although a lessened focus on them would be appreciated. And by the way, ""it's in every series"" isn't much of a reason to do something - let's try to be more analytical of why this sort of thing happens. It's basically the classic Star Wars Episode 1 issue: the suits have told you that kids can't identify with anything that's not a human child. That show you made about giant transforming robots? Kids won't be able to understand what's going on! They don't have a handy character to see as a substitute for themselves! So, you write a bunch of kids in instead of making them realize that just because a character looks like an alien robot doesn't mean they can't be very human and sympathetic.

Humans should be involved because more often than not the action takes place on Earth. Of course, to make us care about the stakes, it makes sense to have a bunch of stuff for the Decepticons to menace. In Prime, the humans were central to the plot, constantly. It was practically more about them than the robots, and in a show not called ""KIDS: HUMANS NOT IN DISGUISE"" that's an issue. Not to mention, when you look at G1, you've got a 15 year old kid with grit, determination, and a good head on his shoulders; a girl about to go to MIT for engineering; and a wheelchair-bound genius who went to Yale for sci-fi science. When they didn't have the sense to stay on the sidelines, there were plenty of ways for the humans to help the Autobots. In Prime, their contributions tend to vary between ""Miko did something that's going to get her killed again"" and ""Jack's being an obnoxious teen"", and tend to veer less on the useful and pragmatic side of things, and when they were useful, it tended to be through happenstance or far-fetched logic (oh, the 13 year old kid can hack us out of this situation? How wonderful, if only this race of super advanced sentient machines knew that much about computers)."
Transformers Prime,"The humans, in my opinion (and please, this is all my opinion), stems from a lack of imagination on the writer's end. I like to think that they never took time and thought what the humans are for. Now, they have become a crutch so it is easier for kids/people/humans to relate to these robots dealing with an intergalactic struggle, a very inhuman issue. 
  
Though the original series did have humans, I did not feel for them like I did the transformers. G1 was written in such a way that I sympathized with Bumblebee because he faced issues that pertained to me. He was a young scout and one of the smallest Autobots and he is scared. Bumblebee feels small and unequip but he is brave and that is why I root for him. Because I secretly want to be brave in spite of my fears. 
    
He follows Optimus because Optimus sees the value in Bumblebee, in spite of stature and maturity, and that is why I feel his is so very heroic, not simply because he is in charge and you've been told to look to him for guidance.  
  
The humans were a sub plot, the Autobots feel the desire to conserve life and so they protect us from the more powerful Decepticons. In return, the humans courageously assist the Autobots and that is how they get the upper hand when facing Megatron's forces. Autobots do the kind thing and are rewarded with victory. In short, humans demonstrate how and why good triumphs evil and Bumblebee is who we view the plot through.  
  
For a show designed to move toys, G1 was very tightly written from a character stand point. Nowadays a lot of media, Transformers or otherwise, play it fast and loose with character work and that's where you find uninteresting short cuts like human-centric Transformers plots.
  
TL;DR When the series is sloppily done you are forced to deal with humans."
Transformers Prime,Yeah G1 had a lot of humans. People just need to accept them now.
Transformers Prime,I watched it because I was looking for something like beast wars and was disappointed. It's good just not what I wanted.
Transformers Prime,"Yeah it's alright,but since they're both on the same network and 80's remakes hearing it just makes me wanna watch ""GI Joe Renegades."" That show-quality. "
Transformers Prime,Transformers Armada
Transformers Prime,"For those unaware, this is not from any season.

This is the made for TV movie: Predacon Rising. It takes place immediately after season 3 end."
Transformers Prime,"Is this series worth the watch?

Beast wars was amazing "
Transformers Prime,"This and TF: Animated are the best Transformers series by far, imo."
Transformers Prime,Yes.
Transformers Prime,I'm more of a Beast Wars fan myself...
Transformers Prime,Still waiting for something as good... haven’t seen any come close
Transformers Prime,Seems like this week is the week for shows that didn't get promoted and are there just to fill in slots. Hopefully there are a few gems that stick around for quite a while!
Transformers Prime,"Watched the Super Fun Night pilot.  It was really rough.  Rebel Wilson was struggling with the American accent the whole time, and there were a couple out-of-place, incredibly dark jokes that just killed the tone of the scene they were in.  Skip it."
Transformers Prime,Ironside: a guy in a wheelchair and three models pretending to be cops get *street justice*.
Transformers Prime,[deleted]
Transformers Prime,Have I Got News For You is the only one I'm looking forward to.
Transformers Prime,I actually enjoy Murdoc Mysteries and it will be bumping Hostages from my OTA PVR recording list. Can't wait to fast forward through the CBC commercials.
Transformers Prime,I just saw the trailer and you know what they say when you try to market something by capitalizing on your past work and name dropping. 
Transformers Prime,"Hey, I cannot find the typo, can you point it out for me?"
Transformers Prime,It's Have I not I Have.
Transformers Prime,fixed
Transformers Prime,[deleted]
Transformers Prime,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Transformers Prime,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Transformers Prime,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Transformers Prime,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Transformers Prime,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Transformers Prime,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Transformers Prime,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Transformers Prime,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Transformers Prime,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Transformers Prime,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Transformers Prime,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Transformers Prime,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Transformers Prime,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Transformers Prime,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Transformers Prime,🙂💕
Transformers Prime,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Transformers Prime,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Transformers Prime,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Transformers Prime,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Transformers Prime,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Transformers Prime,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Transformers Prime,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Transformers Prime,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Transformers Prime,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Transformers Prime,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Transformers Prime,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Transformers Prime,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Transformers Prime,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Transformers Prime,"I’m sure there were like a dozen shows that did it before Lost and people are going to point out that I’m a moron, but I love that Lost format of having a chunk of every episode be flashbacks about something that happened one character that both works as exposition while also echoing the A-Plot happening on the island."
Transformers Prime,"There were others before it, but The Office definitely popularized the mockumentary format

Lost popularized serialized television (rather than traditional episodic ) for network tv. It also started the mystery box show trend"
Transformers Prime,"**Twin Peaks** is often seen as the grandfather of modern ""prestige TV"" because of how it combined serialized storytelling, mature themes, and feature film-like cinematography. It's been directly cited as a major influence for dozens of subsequent shows."
Transformers Prime,"I Love Lucy basically invented the sitcom. It was the first sitcom to use a live studio audience, it pioneered the three-camera filming setup, it was the first to broadcast rerun episodes, and it originated many classic sitcom tropes."
Transformers Prime,"Firefly - first shows that did snap zoom CGI effects, where things end up being out of focus. They were creating deliberately imperfect effects to give everything an older TV visual feel."
Transformers Prime,Lost
Transformers Prime,"**Wiseguy** (1987-1990)  A series about an undercover agent Vinnie Terranova, who investigates various criminal organizations.  The series used clear episode ""arcs"" for each investigation.  In between the main arcs were ""filler"" episodes that explored the lives of not only Terranova, but his supervisor Frank McPike and his main handler ""Lifeguard"" Burroughs.

The arc storylines ran anywhere from 4 episodes to 11 episodes.  This allowed the series to introduce and develop antagonists and supporting cast for each story.  It was one of the first network series to use regularly use serialized story telling at a time when most series were episodic."
Transformers Prime,I'm almost certain 24 ushered events occurring in real time and binge watching
Transformers Prime,Mad Men started the basic cable prestige drama trend.
Transformers Prime,"Dallas. The first really grand night time soap opera, inspiring many copycats.

All in the Family. First comedy that handled really heavy political issues and had shocking plotlines covering topics like rape and hate crimes."
Transformers Prime,"The Sam and Diane relationship on  *Cheers* was the first ""will they?/won't they?"" type of character dynamic.

*The Sopranos* was the first (and still the best) antihero drama.

*American Horror Story* invented the seasonal anthology (others had thought about doing it earlier, but *AHS* was the first to pull the trigger.)

*Louie* was one of the first successful auteur-driven sad-as-often-as-funny sitcoms."
Transformers Prime,"Babylon 5 - I think it started the trend of having the full story plotted out ahead of time, and the episodes tied in to that story rather than being self contained.  The story arc, in other words.  Not like what came before where most shows were purely episodic and you could watch almost any episode by itself and have a nice little gift-wrapped, self contained story that required you to have watched no other episodes of the show.

Also I think one of the first shows to really rely heavily on CGI for FX shots."
Transformers Prime,Coupling: first sitcom that went Rashomon often and played with showing events from different characters perspective and being a-chronological.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,Bronys have really put a “stank” on the MLP brand.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Can only speak for myself of course but, I only knew about the show and the “brony” sphere from youtube videos, I didn’t even know what network the show was on and never saw any ads, even though I was still pretty frequently watching cartoon network, nick, disney, and a channel surfer when bored. I was 14F when it came out. 

I will also say that the shows you mentioned, while not my favs, are all very original ideas. My little pony is a show that was based on a thirty yr marketing scheme of toys and such."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"My daughter loved it. She watched all the episodes, all the movies including the ones where they become “human”… and I always thought it was a solid show. 

My wife came home and found me actually paying attention to the show and I was like, “honestly, it’s far better than most of the other kid’s content out there and this is legit entertaining in its own right”."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"The Bronys didn’t help, I can show off Adventure Time and Gravity Falls and Steven Universe shit and not feel weird, but if I were to wear anything Pony related I’d be concerned people would confuse me for a Brony.

But I think it was also just too cutthroat. They kicked Lauren Faust out early seemingly because she wanted to to be a show first and a toy commercial second. And then they did those godawful human version of all the ponies going to a high school movies that really screamed “none of this matter, all the rules will change whenever we think we can sell you more toys because of it.”"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"I'm not saying furries and MLP are linked, but both are loved and hated in much the same way."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Jenny Nicholson released a superb deep dive [report](https://youtu.be/4fVOF2PiHnc) on FiM and the subculture impact on YouTube.

You might want to have a look."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"It is very difficult to assess the ""impact"" of any show without a concerted effort to either interview and collect data from fans (and in your question, non-fans). This usually requires some level of academic research and funding interesting, which MLP:FIM never really got to the level of say, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"".

However, we do see some cultural critics pointing to the idea that MLP:FIM, while driven by commercial interest (selling toys) targeted at girls was able to expand to a dual audience (men) through more hard fantasy and even hard sci-fi plot lines.

Contrast this to, say, The Powerpuff Girls which used similar ideas, but still had a primarily male audience, and did not achieve MLP:FIM's dual audience success.

The most obvious outcome of the success of MLP:FIM is DC Super Hero Girls which follows the MLP:FIM archetype, again, attempting for a dual audience.

But overall, MLP:FIM I would say is part of a trend (or maybe started the trend? Reinforced the trend?) of ""girls programming"" that treats its audience more seriously, more maturely and appeals to both boys and girls. Other examples of this are Miraculous (super hero theming) and even Barbie: Life in the Dream House (essentially a parody of Barbie which seems to inform the upcoming Barbie Movie.)

How much of this came from MLP:FIM and how much was just MLP:FIM being part of a trend? Hard to say. But if you look at the timeline, MLP:FIM preceded many of the other examples I cite here.

My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,Never heard of it.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,The what now?
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"The biggest impact in my opinion was the absolute vilification of men enjoying children's targeted shows. The brony community became more famous than the show.  MLP only achieved popularity with girls aged 4-12...and men. Boys around that age hated the show and it just never achieved popularity with women. 

For the non animation community, it was jarring to see men express fawning interest of a young girls show on the local news. I remember being shocked to see the segment because it mentioned 4chan and at that time 4 chan was still kinda underground.

For the animation community, the brony subset were treated like pariahs because their fandom was out of control. Subset members were never able to completely shirk off the now public pedophilic association. Not to mention as the brony community became more mainstream, explicit MLP context exploded.  Look up 2010s YouTube as bronies were the butt of pedophilia jokes. It was that bad. 

The show's inability to gain dual gender viewership and the ever growing negative connotation of bronies publicly ruined whatever impact it could have had within the animation community.  I forgot to mention that MLP never could secure an overlap with another fandom to help its adult fans. You mentioned steven universe, adventure time,and gravity falls. All of those shows have overlapping fans. All of those shows appeal to multiple genders. The 2010s we're heavy in overlapping fandoms. Remember the Tumblr days of Superwholock? I can't name any shows that I would put in the same category of MLP due to its fan base."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Honestly I just don’t get the appeal. I’ve watched a few episodes. It’s mediocre. To me it’s identical to anything else that came out around then with young women as the targeted demographic. It’s a bright goofy show about toys, to get children to ask their parents for toys. I mean that’s okay, that’s what most kid shows are. I just don’t understand why this particular show sucked up so many adult men. It’s strange. And there’s something to it that we just haven’t quite cracked yet. A common assumption is they’re pedophiles, I don’t think that’s quite the case. Others say it appeals to people with autism, there’s evidence to back it up, but that seems more like correlation than causation. Ive also heard people say it’s a joke but I don’t believe people are spending thousands of dollars on conventions and plane tickets as a joke. I feel like there’s something else about it that made it take off so hard. Something that separated it from the Barbie shows or the bratz movies, despite the fact that they’re essentially identical. (From the perspective of a non fan) 

The impact is has made for me personally is that it is an enigma. It’s like if one day adults just started losing their shit for coco melon. It makes no sense to me, but I’m pretty fascinated by the whole situation. I don’t care that people are bronies but I personally don’t want to hang out with them. I like plenty of shows for kids. Adventure time, regular show, spongebob, drake and josh, Jake long, etc. and I know my friends watch them too. However, I’m not going to drake and josh con. I’m not buying over the garden wall jackets for 80 dollars from hot topic. I’m not going to wear a hat like finn’s to school everyday. It’s strange to make a children’s show your entire identity. No it’s not a crime, but it’s weird. I feel like the bronies know it’s weird, that’s part of why they do it. I’m not trying to be a jerk but most people will always see it as weird. Bronies made sure of that. 

Also my niece used to talk about it constantly and she says they ruined the show when they made the main character a unicorn."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,The cartoon was not watchable
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"MLP along with Adventure time essentially laid the groundwork for 2010s animation, MLP was without a doubt the biggest cartoon of its time from 2011-2015, but it did fade in popularity after that but retained a dedicated and active fanbase. 

Also the term cultural impact makes me roll my eyes after the Avatar discussions lately.

  
Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"I'm a brony so my answered is a bit skewed but.
I think it really paved the way for kids shows enjoyed by adults. Yeah there where some before, but this one was in the unique position of coming out 2010s.
The early 2010s where weird, the internet was growing, internet culture was growing aswellm but also was it getting easier to watchs. The first 3 seasons of mlp you could find the episodes in full uploaded to YouTube, just there. It wasn't hard to find them. Before that you had to look at shady sites where you downloaded the show. Alot of people wouldn't do that."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"It ruined its own impact by being ruined forever once Lauren Faust left. And G5 is the worst show of all time and is humiliatingly grasping onto relevance by constantly making shitty references to G4, but nobody cares. I don’t see it lasting beyond Netflix’s original order. After that MLP cartoons are *dead*. It’d be remembered so fondly if they hadn’t fucked everything up!"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"I mean the name itself implies that it's targeted for kids and girls at that. Soo the immediate impression is always going to be, dudes a creep."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Nah, few bad apples, but the stank came from insecure men calling bronies pedophiles, homosexual slurs and the like, maybe you don't remember well, but the way the average person treated a brony after say...2012 when bronies weren't everywhere is the kind of bigotry that gets people cancelled like nothing today, it was simply a more toxic time."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"A show which celebrates friendship, how overcoming differences/conflicts can deepen friendships, and how friendship and social support can help one get through stressful times. I’m definitely ok with my kids watching it."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,Yea.  Had a daughter in the target demographic at the time it was on.  Watched a lot of kids content during that time and it stood out with having a decent story.  Been a long time now so can’t really say what was unique about it and have no desire to rewatch but it was a good show for what it was.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,I was 50+ when my daughter was deeeeep intonthe whole MLP world and thoroughly enjoyed the Equestria Girls movies.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"So...many...bodypillows...

It was an uncomfortable but still interesting watch."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"I have to say, this is a very will thought out answer."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"I heard about it and didn't really understand what a Brony was at the time, but I knew of Adventure Time and similar shows, thought it would fall into that category of cartoon based on reviews people were throwing out at the time. It took me about 2 episodes to realize it was literally just... A show about ponies for kids.

Also when the core audience is a split of children and adults on 4chan... Nothing good is gonna come of that."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"> Like one simply needed to walk around a mall in 2014 to see how massive MLP was, with all audiences.

Unlike other kids shows at the time, MLP’s market was (after a bit of time) and adult demographic that was full of die-hard fans that could 1.) Afford merch, and 2.) Wanted every piece of merch they could get.

Just because something is prevalent in stores doesn’t mean it’s “culturally relevant.” By all means, most people had no interest in show simply because of the culture surrounding it.

I myself stand to think that the show is probably a good one and is probably (maybe?) Adventure Time-esque in quality, but I have literally 0 interest in watching it because of the stigma. I think that at the end of the day, this was the zeitgeist the show had (and even if people were unaware of Brony culture, they likely associated it as an overly cutesy show for little girls) and thus it wasn’t really in a position to gain ground."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"The show peaked in ratings during season 4, and had the biggest fan events during season 5, so clearly ditching Lauren didn't damage the brand that much"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Uh I think 90% of the stank and mistreatment probably came from the fact that the ponies (including young looking ponies) got sexualized by weird people and those perverts took up more and more space in the fandom until they scared off the rest of the normal fans and kids, so it became a self perpetuating problem"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"I love all the downvotes, indicator that people will resort to negative dismissal instead of just admitting that they were probably the asshole 10 years ago buying into misconceptions or misinformation and generalized a group of people based on nothing but a show they liked and what a few people who also liked that show did."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,a few bad apples spoils the whole batch.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"This is ultimately why I hate discussions around cultural impact, its nigh impossible to find an objective to the goalposts can constantly be moved.

Look at Avatar (Cameron), people say it has no cultural impact due to reasons such as, no memes, lack of internet activity and discussions regarding it, and lack of popular common merchandise

MLP: FIM comparatively has, millions upon millions of memes, tons of internet activity and discussions even now (albeit massively less than when the show was still airing and in it's peak) and tons of merchandise for all ages from toys to clothes to school supplies. 

A massive youtube scene both official and fan wise, with fanmade song ""Discord"" having 65 million views and tons others reaching to 10M and beyond, fan animations such as Snowdrop having 20 million views or Lullaby for a princess with 51 million views. On the official content ""Welcome to the show"" from the second Equestria Girls movie has 338 MILLION views for its oldest upload, with another upload having 138M views  
and of course tons of other official content reaches into 10s of millions of views even into the later seasons

Surges of conventions with the most prominent reaching double digit attendance a few times for such a specific niche show.

So where is the line of it having no real impact besides popular merch, popular on the internet, popular with fan content and official content, and being the talk of the internet for both good and bad for nearly a decade?"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,Yes it did.
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"As someone who was actually in the Fandom
No, not really
Obviously there was a porn problem, but it was aboalutelt not a majority or even discussed in any of the sites or circles I used, maybe on 4chan it was

Seems more like people just grasped onto it as a reason to demean others

Look how much Pokémon or Animal Crossing porn there is...or actually don't. But it's there, and yet they are considered demented perverts"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"...is a fundamentally problematic saying when you're talking about individual human beings.

Calling people, Mainly teens and young adults slurs and telling them to off themselves isn't suddenly justified because you heard some of them were drawing porn or that you personally thought they were weird.

You as in general people, not you specifically"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"“Cultural impact” isn’t always positive. I don’t think that the show was ultimately viewed as anything more than a kinda awkward thing that only the fanbase wanted anything to do with.

I suppose it entered into the cultural Zeitgeist sure, but at the end of the day, it was a relatively niche thing tied to a weird corner of the internet that a lot of people wanted nothing to do with."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Adult male MLP fans literally all had autism. This is not me using autism as an insult, I unironically believe if they academically studied it they would struggle to find non-autistic adult male MLP fans.

MLP was an incredibly appealing world for autistic people, because the key theme was friendship and the messages near universally was “if you are nice to people, they will be your friend, and if they aren’t your friend after you are nice to them then something is wrong with them, not you”. This isn’t true, you can be nice and still be an incredibly annoying, or even repulsive person to be around, but autistic people have huge trouble understanding **why** people might not like them, so MLP was perfect escape fantasy in the same way Scott Pilgrim or Fight Club might be for other people.

The stink was because it was a community of almost exclusively autistic men, and pretty much identical to 4chan if 4chan decided being nice was better than being a meanie. Oh yeah and it literally started on 4chan."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Maybe, but within the broader ""niche"" of western animation, it still is among the top, search trends while not infallible or even super reliable show MLP with a steep lead over the 2nd biggest of the 2010s, which was adventure time in the U.S. As for Worldwide it is much closer with MLP still in the lead and AT close behind (both of which far beyond the other options.

That extends to today where its avg interest is still higher than these other shows (AT, Steven Universe, Gravity falls, etc) all ended for years now"
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"This is arguably one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read, and is peak redditor (since we are generalizing here) thinking they have anything near the ability to diagnose MILLIONS of people based on a show that they had a shared interest in. You do realize that many many many people liked MLP not because and absolutely not solely because of the theme of friendship right? A lot of people liked it for the same reason adults to this day enjoy Disneys animated films, because they are lighthearted simple escapism in an enjoyable universe with engaging although no overly complex characters and stories.

It is really that simple, but instead of simple acceptance you reach into this insane idea that It attracts exclusively autistic adult audience for these reasons you made up, reasons that aren't even true which is the funniest part.

MLP even at the simplest point of its storytelling (the first season) never once said that as long as you are nice everyone will be your friend and ABSOLUTELY never went with the ""if they are not, it's with them, not you"" that is just made up drivel.  


I liked MLP for the same reason I enjoyed Gravity Falls, or Owl House, or Steven Universe for a time, because I thought it was a well made animated show, and I love the medium of animation."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,Are you autistic?
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"No, fantastic response though."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"Your posts are all about video games, hypothetical matchups between 40k characters and superheroes, and you haven’t noticed that the Brony fandom is extremely autistic, so I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that either that’s a lie or your mum just never got you tested."
My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,"You felt the need to check my profile and want to diagnose me with some kind of mental illness? 

Reddit is an extension of my free time,specifically the free time I spend inside and not going out with my friends or family.  I like spending that free time with video games, films, tv shows, books and yeah vs matchups are fun lil comparisons to make between characters. It's silly but fun, in the same way any entertainment is.

Seriously you think you are clever? You are an ableist piece of shit trying to pretend you aren't using autism as an insult while using negative connotations to then accuse me and others of being autistic.

I didn't ""notice"" the brony fandom is extremely autistic because I actually knew a bunch of them, not got my information from cringe compilations like you seem to have. Some definitely seem to be autistic of the ones I meant, or display some other kind of developmental disorder, but the majority I met were just...young adults who seemed perfectly devoid of anything.

Look inward, you're an asshole."

Even now, I find myself relating to your other characters such as Raven from both, Teen Titans and Teen Titans Go!, as well as Twilight Sparkle from My Little Pony FiM. 

**Out of all the many characters you’ve voiced, both recent and past, who’s the one you most identify with? And who’s the one you least identify with?

The Fall,Everyone loves Rose. She is a great actress.
The Fall,"I was not aware that the US had remade this show, how does it compare to the British version?"
The Fall,So crazy to see numbers like 6.5 mil for the top network comedy. Shows used to get canned for debuting to less than 20 mil. How the times have changed…
The Fall,"The US version seems to go on an Office arc of having quite a rocky start, and then finding its own feet and improving quickly from there.

I'm glad, I think it's a really charming premise that lends itself well to getting its own spin in lots of different places with different histories."
The Fall,"This show is such a gem. Incredibly strong ensemble cast. Talented writers filling every moment, not wasting a second. Great pop reference humor, great physical humor. Very funny and quick witted dialogue. 

Very likeable characters and a story with heart. Great formula, checks off every box. It feels like a sitcom but any campiness is clever and fresh. Fun show."
The Fall,This is a fantastic show. Very clever and the cast is wonderfully talented.
The Fall,I watched the British version of this show. Should I watch this too? Did they reuse the same plots and jokes?
The Fall,Be awesome to have a crossover of the two versions of the shows where one of the couples goes on vacation to the other’s B&B & both wives can see the ghosts.
The Fall,The show is fun with a diverse cast. They got cool storylines and it hasn’t got repetitive/ boring in any episode yet. I hope it gets auto renewed for season 3 yesterday.
The Fall,Rose McIver is hilarious.
The Fall,Streaming hasn't given us comedy. Network still does.
The Fall,"It always surprises me how big the TV landscape has become.   Here we have the highest rated fall comedy in its second season.  Hell, I didn't even know there was a season 1!"
The Fall,Who the fuck watches young Sheldon? Lol
The Fall,">Even young Sheldon

Who the fuck is watching that garbage?"
The Fall,"Go watch the BBC version on HBO Max!! If the US version is an ounce as charming, campy and comedic as BBC’s then wowza !

Edit: BBC version being the original Ghosts"
The Fall,"Had no interest in this show, but I'm starting to hear really good things and Drew Tarver is a guest in an episode, so I might need to check it out"
The Fall,"It’s a great show. The UK version is just as good. Several plot overlaps, but enough changes to be different."
The Fall,I love both versions of the series. They are different enough and I enjoy them for what they are.
The Fall,It’s a great show I look forward to every week!
The Fall,"Ok so, Young Sheldon is better than BBT right? Because I see episodes of YS on and think man this is surprisingly pretty good!"
The Fall,I really like the simplicity of this show!
The Fall,Yay. I’m a new viewer and worried it could get axed. Glad people are watching
The Fall,it's such a good show
The Fall,"I don't watch this show. Not my cup of tea. So why did I even bother posting this? Because I want to say: GOOD.

I absolutely LOVE Rose McIver and I wish her all the best. I loved iZombie and loved her as Tinkerbell on OUAT. AND she was a Power Ranger? She's badass and deserves the success.

At some point, I will probably watch it, however, there is just SO MUCH on TV and Streaming right now I simply don't have the time to try and get into Sitcoms."
The Fall,It’s a fun show. And appeals to multiple ages.
The Fall,"I'm surprised. I never heard of it until maybe a week ago, and I honestly thought the commercial I saw was pretty terrible. Maybe I'll check it out."
The Fall,I find Young Sheldon depressing.
The Fall,"I like the American version better than the British version for many reasons, but the biggest one is probably that the husband in the British show is just a total a hole and Jay is just the best husband ever

Watching the British show I just didn’t really like any of the characters, so I stopped watching."
The Fall,I love the British version so I tried this one and thought it was awful!
The Fall,Because Ghosts is actually funny. Young Sheldon is just fucking awful.
The Fall,So does this show get good?
The Fall,“Young Sheldon is a bad show. Even the actor playing Sheldon seems embarrassed to be playing him.”
The Fall,The original is better … this is a rip off
The Fall,How could anything beat Young Sheldon? It’s so clever! /S
The Fall,"The trailer has my interest and I’m picky, I have it in my mental library to watch one day"
The Fall,"I've watched the trailer and this is bizzare. So many of the same scenes as the original only with better looking alternate universe cast members.

The one thing that I did like about the American one was the sleazy conservative is fully pantsless with a permanent little censor mark."
The Fall,Just watch the BBC version
The Fall,Can this be streamed anywhere outside of paramount and Hulu?
The Fall,"I, unfortunately, had to watch the last 5 minutes of this crap every week while big brother was on, and it was awful. So bad that we turned the sound off. How anyone can think that show is entertaining is mind-blowing to me. Young Sheldon sucks as well."
The Fall,Who the fuck watches young Sheldon? WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
The Fall,Yet another shitty American remake.  Network TV is such garbage now.
The Fall,That’s what all the fucking idiots in this nation where doing the other night!
The Fall,I’m still not getting Paramount+. The platforms  are gonna have to fight it out until it all comes back to Hulu or something
The Fall,I’ve watched 3-4 episodes now. Does it eventually get funny? It’s stupid as hell so far. Nice to see Liv Moore though!
The Fall,Good. It’s a great show and a big improvement over the UK original.
The Fall,The show is shit
The Fall,"I don't know anyone who liked young Sheldon. Just accepted that it should be funny because it was the sitcom they were told was funny.

I hate TV these days."
The Fall,">"" Overtaking Even ‘Young Sheldon’

Wait, is Young Sheldon actually popular?"
The Fall,It's generous of them to refer to young sheldon as a comedy
The Fall,"Wait, Young Sheldon is a comedy?"
The Fall,Overtaking Young Sheldon?!?
The Fall,Even Young Sheldon?!?!
The Fall, CBS seems like it’s a network that only has shows for older white people.
The Fall,"Alternate article title: “CBS scores a win for airing two sitcoms opposite hour-long procedurals and reality show garbage.”

These aren’t the best two shows ever, but they are better than their time slot competition."
The Fall,"Wow, young Sheldon is that popular? Guess I thought america was fucked for all the wrong reasons."
The Fall,"Didn't know there was a US remake of this show! Certainly won't be checking it out though because they love butchering the original source material like how they tried to with Inbetweeners and Skins. 

Me and my mum are on series 3 and loving it. 😊"
The Fall,"It’s a cute show, weird that they had two versions of it going at the same time."
The Fall,"Soy faces on the main cast picture here, no thanks."
The Fall,Is the guy on the second to the right wearing a miniskirt? Looks short enough for his nutsack to fall out???
The Fall,Love Liv Morgan!
The Fall,"I loved the first season. It took a few episodes to grow on me but loved it by the end. I’m waiting for the whole season to binge watch it though.

Is the original British version available on any US streaming services?"
The Fall,"I know this sounds corny, but there aren’t a lot of shows teens and their parents can watch together, but this is one. Sure the whole “sucked off” thing is a running gag, and some parents might not be comfortable with that and their kids, but overall it’s a really wholesome and lovely show."
The Fall,"Like Abbott, it's hard to believe this is one of the greatest shows on network TV. But it is."
The Fall,I loved her on iZombie and Once Upon A Time.
The Fall,I just found out the other day that she used to be a Power Ranger!
The Fall,IZombie was so good. Loved how it got into the political stuff in the later seasons.
The Fall,Raises hand
The Fall,The first few episodes of S1 were a bit rough. These episodes mirrored the BBC episodes and seemed poorer in comparison.  They had a handful of good lines. Once they got past that and allowed the characters to have their own voices it worked much better.
The Fall,"how does the US one deal with the sheer amount of 'Fanny' innuendo? 

^((yeah i know it means butt to you guys, but thats nowhere near as risque))"
The Fall,"I watched three episodes after watching the original and felt like it was butchered. Some are saying it comes into it’s own, but I just hated the take on characters."
The Fall,"Watched all the British ones, couldn't get into the American version due to a lot of the jokes being the same as the British, just not done with the same timing. Also, the mains don't have the same chemistry as the British couple and the male lead in the American version really doesn't seem to be a country kind of guy. I made it through the first 3 episodes but others are saying it got better so might have to binge it. It might be like Parks and Rec where it takes a bit to find its feet."
The Fall,Never seen the UK one but Im enjoying this very much. Its a fun 20ish minutes
The Fall,"Same show, but every actor is more attractive in the US version."
The Fall,[deleted]
The Fall,It doesn't.
The Fall,"The british one is miles better, it is also less agenda driven with some characters and just funny."
The Fall,"Basically the first season in America is all 3 season of the uk version exactly the same story plot, they changed alot of the ghost characters which I'm not a fan, uk version is far better."
The Fall,"way better.  I'm not a British TV hater so this isn't biased, but the american version is just paced better and funnier."
The Fall,"The US has similar ghosts, but they're not an exact copy, so the stories couldn't really be the same either. It does feel a little crowded sometimes since they have more ghosts, but it stands on it's own."
The Fall,"what was the ""on the bubble"" range back in the late 00's? In my head I think it maybe have been around the 2-3 mil mark? Debuts were closer to 5-10 mil i think

I remember shows I really liked hovering around 1.x mil"
The Fall,"Joey got cancelled for “only” having nine million.  At the time that was nearly twice the entire population of my country & that blew my mind.  They just cancelled it with four episodes left to air which were already produced.  

Replaced it with Seinfeld re-runs AFAIKR which had over twenty million."
The Fall,Streaming..
The Fall,"Crazy. Of course, VHS aside, everyone would have to watch Seinfeld live."
The Fall,"My guess is the first three episodes or so were basically the ""pilot"" where they just lifted the scripts from the original show and did the most minor of changes.

This got them to get the whole cast together and actually start writing for what they have and not the UK cast."
The Fall,Try the original BBC show.  It's really wonderful.
The Fall,"I don’t get it. My wife and I are working through the first season, but don’t find it funny. Does it eventually get funny?"
The Fall,"They did so early on in the show, but it became more of a different take on the same premise/prompt afterwards.  The ghosts mostly have significantly different origins, so it does lead to different stuff.

The through-line of a B&B is the same, but it really isn't that important of a plot point in either series."
The Fall,"as an american, i always prefer british humor but i love them both in their own ways. don’t listen to the haters"
The Fall,No. THe UK one is absolute gold. This not so much.
The Fall,Americans do everything worse
The Fall,I'd watch it.
The Fall,"I don't know why but it cracks me up that Sasappis is like the most normal person on the entire show. No wisened, mystical Native American crap. He's just... A sarcastic dude."
The Fall,"Agree on all points! I really enjoy the different relationships that existed prior to Sam and Jay buying the place and the ones developing now. 

In my social circle, I’m the only one who watches it so far and it’s so frustrating not having anyone to talk to about it but I bet they will catch on soon. So glad it’s getting more popular! Well deserved."
The Fall,"I’m glad the showrunners said that despite the Inn now being open, it isn’t going to be a “guest of the week” type of show."
The Fall,Nobody actually has Peacock but they have a bunch of really good original comedies on there.
The Fall,Reboot has been pretty good so far.
The Fall,"I don't know, Netflix's *I Think You Should Leave* is the funniest shit I've seen in 20 years. But that may be the exception that proves the rule."
The Fall,"Hulu has done well. Reboot, Always Murders, Futureman are all solid comedies."
The Fall,"Tons of good streaming comedies. Heres are a few off the top of my head:

- Reboot
- The Rehersal
- Killing It
- Marvelous Ms Maisel
- Acapulco
- Hacks
- Minx"
The Fall,New seasons of Reno911 were fucking great. They got cancelled and resurrected by quibi and then roku
Fate/Zero,You said that there are some really great anime but that most of it is crap. That is true. But it is also true of pretty much every genre of fiction there is.  Which means that there is nothing special or noteworthy about anime in this regard.
Fate/Zero,"Not a fan of anime culture and most anime series. That said, I really like the whole Dragon Ball series (DB, DBZ, DBGT, DBS)."
Fate/Zero,"You should watch Satoshi Kon's works, especially Paranoia Agent, which is his only anime series. It's definitely different than what we think when anime comes up in mind."
Fate/Zero,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law
Fate/Zero,"I love anime, but it is so hard to recommend to people because of how some shows treat the sexualization of child characters. 

Made in Abyss is one of the best shows I've seen in years. The background art is amazing, the worldbuilding is top tier, and the plot twists hit you like a hard punch in the soul. But there are like 3 very uncomfortable scenes where the main character is taking a bath or being tied up naked. 

Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the best and most popular anime of all time. In End of Evangelion, one of the main characters visits his injured colleague in the hospital and while he is there he pulls down her blanket and masturbates to her exposed chest. Then there is a close up of his hand covered in jizz while he contemplates how fucked up he is. It's not gratuitous and it adds to the plot by showing how far his mental state has deteriorated by that point, but it still makes recommending the series to someone kind of awkward."
Fate/Zero,"There are plenty of adult anime’s just gotta put a bit more effort into searching. 

Try Attack On Titan, One Punch Man, Mob Psycho, Black Lagoon, Samurai Champloo, Code Geass, Psycho Pass, Beserk, Evangelion, Trigun, Hellsing"
Fate/Zero,"Gunbuster is older but its worth checking out. Its a 6 episode series from 1988 made by Studio Gainax (Evangelion, Gurren Lagann).

  
I've turned to a lot of older anime recently just because it has a lot less of the ""Highschool life + whacky gimmick"" plots and themes.

  
"
Fate/Zero,">juvenile writing

>overdramatic voice acting

>waifu characters

>Fate/Zero being good.

>Fate/Zero being the literal embodiment of all those things."
Fate/Zero,"I'm a fan. A lot of the mainstream animes are as you describe above but there are some really nice, salt of the earth animes that really capture day-to-day life in japan in completely non-sexualied ways. 

K-On is one of the most wholesome shows I've watched. 4 girls who desperately want to start a rock band. 

Haikyuu is about highschool Volleyball and their struggles to make it to nationals. 

Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad. Similar to K-On in a way but just a little bit darker.

Then you have the amazingly animated films like *Your Name*, *The Girl Who Leapt Through Time*, *Wolf Children*, ~~The Garden of Words~~.
All super wholesome and not at all sexual. I recommend. "
Fate/Zero,"Anime is just another medium to tell stories. Find the ones that are telling the stories you are interested in.

Some suggestions I can give are Zombieland SAGA (light hearted/funny with a bit of commentary on idol shows)

That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime if you like a more video game skew to things.

If you like emotional ones Violet Evergarden was sweet and sad.

If you want action I would recommend My Hero Academia (gets you that Dragon Ball Z fighting sort of show but it does not shy away from the tropes).

Darker ones I could suggest are The Saga of Tanya the Evil (quite possibly the most ridiculous premise for a show), Darker than Black, Psycho Pass (though season 2 was not as strong) and a favorite of mine Made in Abyss. 

Though Made in Abyss will likely make you uncomfortable in a several spots. It has both amazing art and music direction and the story, while unfinished right now, is captivating I find."
Fate/Zero,it's okay. I've only binge watched one though. Some can be sad and some can be weird. Like when I watched Totoro as a kid. That brings back pretty melancholy flashbacks. 
Fate/Zero,"I like older stuff, or darker/more mature from any period. It seems like sometime in the last 15(?) years, romance and harem and high school drama anime became incredibly popular, and that continues to this day. You look through the new shows for a given year and it seems like 90% of it revolves around teen or pre-teen girls.

The older stuff though, mechs and cyberpunk and weird sci-fi and violent horror? That shit was hot."
Fate/Zero,Steins;gate starts out a bit slow but delivers
Fate/Zero,"Some of my favorite shows ever are anime : Death Note, Attack on Titan, and HunterXHunter. One Punch Man and My Hero Academia are fucking awesome as well. "
Fate/Zero,I try not to think about it.
Fate/Zero,"I just want to point out that **A Place Further Than The Universe** is completely innocent and belongs on any list of good, clean anime. 

And then there's anime with sexualization where it's part of the style and it works, just like we see in Western media. **Kill La Kill** is super sexualized, but it's making a point by sexualizing it's characters and it does it in style. It's no different than any Western TV show today sexualizes it's characters well, and better than the uncountably numerous shows that don't do it well. 

You want creepy? Let's talk about r/community sexualizing Allison Brie, despite her playing a character on that show with the maturity of a 13 year-old. Sure, the actress was much older and the character was technically legal but she was essentially playing a child and at some point her character morphed into a perverted male fantasy of a naive little girl. Watching that made me feel a lot more uncomfortable than watching animated characters.

-edit- I'm also watching **Haikyu!!** right now and it's great and completely non-sexual. Somehow I keep magically finding non-sexual shows."
Fate/Zero,Found the Chad /s
Fate/Zero,It's for kids under 15. 
Fate/Zero,Have you actually watched any animes? 
Fate/Zero,But like I said I think there are way more great tv shows than there are anime. And the garbage anime are worse than most shit tv shows
Fate/Zero,"Would you recommend anyone watch ""cartoons?"" Of course not, as there's such a huge difference between Bojack Horseman and Littlest Pet Shop that you'd accomplish nothing by doing so. So why would you recommend ""anime?""

I can think of a bunch of shows I could recommend with no/little sexualization. Depending on who you're talking to, just limit your recommendations to those."
Fate/Zero,Just make sure to go for the old 1997 Berserk and not the awful new one :)
Fate/Zero,"Hunterxhunter, parasyte"
Fate/Zero,"Code Geass is exactly the type I was taking about. Cheap fanservice in a supposedly serious show, unnecessary forced highschool setting, every female character lusting over the MC etc. It had some interesting ideas but it was drowned in the other stuff"
Fate/Zero,"F/Z had it's flaws (overdramatic voice acting seems to be a thing in basically every anime) but it still explored some interesting themes and had flawed compelling characters. It's a lot better than the recommendations I have been getting here like freaking Code Geass

Also what ""waifu"" characters? Even Saber in that one wasn't ""waifu"" like. I think you are mistaking it for F/SN, that one is the typical otaku pandering shit show with a shounen harem MC, tons of waifu's who obsess over him for shit reasons, lazy power ups etc. Don't tell me you are one of those F/SN fanboys who gets triggered over people realizing that F/Z was better"
Fate/Zero,">*The Garden of Words.* All super wholesome and not at all sexual.

Uh..."
Fate/Zero,"I tried K-On, glad it wasn't sexualized but it was shallow af, nothing there apart from watching ""cute"" (don't even think that's true) girls doing some shit"
Fate/Zero,">You look through the new shows for a given year and it seems like 90% of it revolves around teen or pre-teen girls.

Not really. Just look at what's coming in this the Spring season: *One Punch Man*, *Kimetsu No Yaiba*, *Attack on Titan*, *Fairy Gone, Sarazanmai*, *Mix*, *Bungo Stray Dogs*, *Daimond no Ace,* along with continuing stuff like *One Piece, Boruto, Black Clover, JoJo, Dororo*, etc. There's slice of life comedy stuff with young girls, yes. But even some of that stuff can be pretty good. And it certainly doesn't represent anywhere near 90% of the content."
Fate/Zero,"It also has pverly creepy bullshit. Groping and the shpwer perving.

Watched at relase and loved it. Rewatched and couldn't finish it too gross."
Fate/Zero,Currently watch hxh for the third time 😅
Fate/Zero,"Yeah, I disagree. I'd argue that the television that you are exposed to is simply better filtered than the anime. There is plenty of *really* bad television out there but because you don't watch the cable channel it airs on you never get exposed to it"
Fate/Zero,"There are way more TV shows full stop.

99% of everything is trash."
Fate/Zero,"Have you watched Berserk Redux, it effectively combines the 97 series with the Golden Egg trilogy to be more accurate to the Manga. 
You can check it out here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/berserk/wiki/advice#wiki_.27A4check_out_the_berserk_redux.2C_a_fan_edit_of_the_berserk_animations."
Fate/Zero,"Code gease is strange. It more or less rides off premise/ opening  and it's incredible ending.

It's middle is everything you say. Its fan base has selective memory."
Fate/Zero,"The fact that you try to rate Fate/Zero as having some ""interesting themes"" and ""flawed compelling"" characters says it all. Fate writing is a shit show. 

What this thread shows is just that the OP is suffering under the delusion that anime is a genre instead of it being a medium. He can justify Fate ""loli bait"" Zero as much as he wants, but once he realizes that anime isn't what he thinks it is, all his qualms will be resolved. "
Fate/Zero,"Ha! Actually yeah, sorry. I was purely thinking about the atmosphere and art. Completely forgot about the weird story. That’s my bad. "
Fate/Zero,"Yeah, I don't see any reason to think that, really.  I grew up in the age where Alf was above average."
Fate/Zero,"I have not! Bought the old box set when that came out and pretty much left it at that. I mean, back then I took what I could get lol!

Thank you for the info!"
Fate/Zero,"The rest of the Fate franchise is a shit show in terms of writing, F/Z is definitely far superior to the rest and quite good. How is it loli bait? Again I think you are confusing it with another Fate series.

Never said anime is a genre, doesn't change that most of the medium is trash, far worse than tv shows. How about you tell me what anime you consider to be good? "
Fate/Zero,that's more of a commentary on how bad television was in the 80s than anything.
Fate/Zero,"F/Z is not 'superior'. Fate/Zero just happens to be the one you like. Fate/Zero is just a bunch of pedo-loli-incest bait and muscular men screaming at each other. The typical shounen garbage.

The only anime I ever thought was good was 'The Soul Taker', other than some anime movies like Sword of the Stranger and...just Sword of the Stranger."
Fate/Zero,"It's a comment on how formulaic 80s comedies were.  Any genre goes through periods where the average example of it is formulaic crap, and periods where it's good.  I love a lot of country music from the 60's and very little from the 90's for the reason."
Fate/Zero,"Except there was no loli or incest stuff in F/Z..you are confusing it with another Fate series (called Prisma Illya or some shit, that one was creepy and sexualized kids). People do scream at each other but it's never ""Shounen"" stuff, in fact it goes against that type and the MC is a ruthless anti hero. There is no friendship power either. It's a battle royale with everyone trying to kill each other.

Sword of the stranger does look interesting, I may check it out"
Fate/Zero,"Fate/Zero had a bunch of incest themes. And it was used to set up the incest/loli themes in the later Fate series by explaining why Illya is Shirou's sister and ""18 but with the body of a 12 year old teehee"".

Sword of the Stranger is a random shounen movie where the main character literally saves the day because of the power of friendship and is overpowered for no reason because his past is never adequately explained

This is what I'm talking about. The quality of ""anime"" to you depends solely on whether or not you happen to think what you're watching is enjoyable."
Fate/Zero,"> Fate/Zero had a bunch of incest themes.

Wait, I'm confused. _When?_ I literally cannot think of a single moment where incest is even remotely relevant to Fate/Zero's story (and I've watched it twice).

> And it was used to set up the incest/loli themes in the later Fate series by explaining why Illya is Shirou's sister and ""18 but with the body of a 12 year old teehee"".

Fate/Zero didn't ""set up"" these things - Illya's youthful appearance (and her relation to Shirou) had already been fully established in Fate/Stay Night."
Fate/Zero,Fate/Zero sets up and justifies the incest/pedo/loli themes.
Fate/Zero,You're just saying the same thing over and over again without elaborating. Tell me HOW Fate/Zero sets up and justifies incest/pedo/loli themes.
Fate/Zero,"""She's not really a little girl. She's ACTUALLY 18 GUYS."" _wink wink_"
Fate/Zero,"But... she's only 8 years old in Fate/Zero. It's a _prequel_.

In Fate/Zero, Illya appears in like two scenes and doesn't interact romantically or sexually with any other character. The incestuous themes were only present in Fate/Stay Night."
Fate/Zero,"Yes. It sets up that she's 8 in F/Z and 18 in FSN, just so they can say ""She's totally 18 guys, let her fuck her big brother."" Oh wait...her ""little"" brother."
Fate/Zero,"> Yes. It sets up that she's 8 in F/Z and 18 in FSN, just so they can say ""She's totally 18 guys, let her fuck her big brother.""

The way you talk about this series is confusing me. You do know that F/SN was released two years before F/Z, right? It was literally impossible for F/Z to ""set up"" something ""so that"" F/SN could use it.

It would be like saying that the Star Wars prequels ""set up"" that Anakin was Luke's father, ""just so"" they could say Darth Vader was related to Luke in episode V.

It would be more accurate to say that F/SN said ""She's totally 18 guys, let her fuck her big brother"" and the writers of F/Z simply subtracted 10 from 18 because they wanted the story to take place ten years in the past."
Fate/Zero,Yes. I know. I'm actually a huge fan of Fate. But I can accept that it's full of pedo-incest-loli bait.
Fate/Zero,Some is great and some is terrible. I have problems with some of the cultural differences and understanding characters motivations sometimes. On a related note I watched Seven Deadly Sins. How pervy is that guy!
Fate/Zero,"Anime is a genre like any other...there are tens of thousands of animes....most of the are shit,some of them are good, just like every medium.  Shows should be judged based on their merits, not their medium."
Fate/Zero,"Like any artistic medium, there are good, bad, and in-between creations. Thankfully, with streaming, you can now try many anime series without making a purchase commitment. 

There are many that I like: Haibane Renmei, Gungrave, Stellvia, Hellsing, Bastard, One Punch Man, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Robotech, etc.

But, like any medium, everyone's taste is different, so it's good that there are many series to choose from."
Fate/Zero,"I used to watch a lot when I was a kid but I found myself trying and giving up on so many series because my interests didn't reflect  most reviews. 

One of the biggest problem is, and Cowboy Bepop's director made the same claim, that the industry is focused on pleasing a targeted audience in Japan so 99% of animes will revolve around tropes and annoying waifus and characters, classrooms and it feels when you've seen one you have seen most of them.

Now that doesn't mean that for all the shit that's out you cannot find odd ducks like cowboy bebop, ergo proxy, planetes etc. The problem is finding those."
Fate/Zero,"pretty much the same, maybe because school life and girl cutesy just not my thing. i'm not watching anime now its been six months the last anime i saw is Fate Heaven's Feels 2 Lost Butterfly. for now no tv-anime catch my attention"
Fate/Zero,"I think about it very similarly to how I think about rap music.  I'm not really into the genre as a whole, but I think a small percentage of it is so good that it can't be ignored in spite of the genre as a whole not being my taste.

Ones I really liked:  

- Samurai Champloo  
- Devilman Crybaby  
- Attack on Titan"
Fate/Zero,Moomins best anime ever made.
Fate/Zero,"The best anime has some incredible writing imo, so I always think of anime as being a well written thing; if has been brought to my attention that isn't the case for all anime though, guess it's like only watching the best Western shows and thinking it's all great.

I love the creativity of the medium, they can do virtually anything they can draw and they take advantage of that. That's attractive in itself."
Fate/Zero,"Mixed bag, some great anime still has some weird attitudes towards women and some cringey camera angles forcing perspective. I feel bad suggesting anime to friend or even trying new anime myself because of that."
Fate/Zero,"> But I'm not a fan of the cliche Shounen stuff like Naruto

How much Naruto (Shippuden) did you watch? Genuine question, because I was in the same boat as you but then I watched a lot of Naruto (out of boredom I guess) and now I'm kinda obsessed with it. The characters really grew on me.

I fuckin love it.

Edit: Haters gonna hate ;)"
Fate/Zero,"I like it. Here in the U.S animation is seen as something either for children, an action oriented show or it's a comedy (and the action shows are always on kids networks unless they get a remake like Samurai Jack.) Anime fills the gap. You not only have comedies you've got action, romance, drama's and lots of other genres that America is too scared to try. I look forward to the day the stigma for animation is lifted. I'd love to see what would happen. As for Slice of Life anime as a female I enjoy it. K-on is good but it's a little too fluffy and cutesy for my liking. That's why I stick to less cutesy comedies like Azumanga Daioh, Ghost Stories, Hare+Guu, School Rumble and Nichijou."
Fate/Zero,"I started watching Anime a year ago.

Like TV, it has good stuff and bad stuff. 

But it also has some masterpieces. 

I recommend you watching [Monster](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434706/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_12) , [Steins;Gate](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1910272/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) and [The Tatami Galaxy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1847445/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1)."
Fate/Zero,"Nichijou is some funny nonsense shit. There are many clips of it on YouTube. But generally I like anime only for the serious tone like Death Note as you mention.

Except One Punch Man which is nice too. But the manga and webcomic are better anyway"
Fate/Zero,I liked the first season of Tokyo Ghoul but in general there is way too much fanservice and sometimes the pacing feels weird to me.
Fate/Zero,A lot of it just annoys me. The only anime ive enjoyed in a few years is one punch man and to a lesser extent my hero academia. Although im behind on both because im never in the mood.
Fate/Zero," I am not a big fan of anime, but there are some I really like and its usually the kind with a more western friendly feel to them. Like the type of anime that is down to earth and doesn't have all that crazy dragonballz full saiyan visual shit. Like Cowboy Bebop, 08th MS Team, Spirited Away, Ghost in The Shell. Elita Battle Angel was good but the whole kid romance thing was a bit much for my age. Watch Rin: Daughters of mnemosyne if you want to feel really conflicted. Great show but man is it fucked up."
Fate/Zero,its great stuff my dudes.
Fate/Zero,"I mostly watch anime because western television has barely anything to offer. Everything looks so uninteresting. And when I give them a shot I usually watch 3 episodes and quite (don't compare 20 to 60 minutes).
And while I'm not a big fan of fan service and stuff like that, I can basically enjoy anything coming from Japan and China. They don't hold back there in terms of writing for exemple so I get to experience some weird shit that I would never see in western television.

8.5/10. Great medium."
Fate/Zero,"Definitely a mixed bag, the only ones I’ve kept up with in the last few years are My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, and Dragon Ball Super.  

I think I enjoyed anime more as a kid growing up, but as Ive grown older I’ve kind fallen out of it. Often times there’s just other things I want to watch, and they just lose priority.  

One Piece I don’t watch regularly, but I read it as much as I can.  It’s one of the few Shonen That I can say has been consistently good for its entire run.  Naruto and Bleach had too many fluctuations and towards the end, they both just fell flat on their faces.



I think my top 5 is

FMA Brotherhood

Cowboy Bebop

Code Geass

Samurai Champloo

One Piece (when it’s all said and done)

Honorable mentions go out to Rurouni Kenshin and Hunter X Hunter (Martin will finish his GoT books, before Togashi writes all of Hunter, you can count on that)."
Fate/Zero,"Yeah but there is a typical anime ""style"", so judging the medium is necessary"
Fate/Zero,"There are far more great western shows than there are great anime though and the worst of anime is also worse than tv shows ever are

Also the medium allows for a lot of creativity, yet they barely use it. Same old tropes and settings get rehashed again and again"
Fate/Zero,"Same and I can't blame people for thinking anime is weird considering some of the creepy stuff that comes out every season. And somehow they are popular enough to keep getting made, surprised people in Japan don't care about that"
Fate/Zero,"Yeah i love it like i love mcu. Of course there's better written, better acted, etc. stuff that amaze me but overall i just love those more."
Fate/Zero,"> I recommend you watching Monster , Steins;Gate and The Tatami Galaxy.

Monster is spectacular...Naoki Urasawa is one of the best story tellers on Earth right now, bar none."
Fate/Zero,You might like Mob Psycho 100. It's by the creator of One Punch man.
Fate/Zero,"> Honorable mentions go out to Rurouni Kenshin and Hunter X Hunter (Martin will finish his GoT books, before Togashi writes all of Hunter, you can count on that).

We should honestly take bets on this."
Fate/Zero,"Oooh, in a world where Two Broke Girls exist I'm not sure I can completely agree. I probably haven't watched the worst anime, but I'm damn sure it can't be much worse than some of the shit I've watched over the years.

I'm not bothered by tropes, that's just another way of saying that they use common storytelling techniques, but they do generally have more interesting setups or even just visuals.

You might well be right, I don't think I've seen enough to come down strong enough on either side but I feel like I have enough of a grasp on it to theorise."
Fate/Zero,"I can only hope it improves or they try some co-produced material, US & JP or EU & JP. When I try anime with housemates or friends I feel I have to be vocal about parts I don't agree with like ""yes, I'm watching this show and I've recommended it to but we both can see that bit was weird"""
Fate/Zero,"Book 5 came out around 2011 I think?

Togashi took his first hiatus in 2012.

They’ve had roughly the same amount of time.

But legitimately, I do think Martin will win out.  Cause since his first hiatus, Togashi has written 40 chapters, and they haven’t even gotten to the Dark Continent.  They’ve been on that boat for so long and very little has happened to move the main plot.  

I don’t actually know what Martins Status is on these books, but he has to be ahead."
Fate/Zero,"> I don’t actually know what Martins Status is on these books, but he has to be ahead.

The last book was supposed to come out like 10 years ago...he's been ""busy at conventions""...and ""telling the show runners how good the ending is supposed to be""."
Fate/Zero,"Many people seem to forget that anime is a medium. Just like in American television, there's a lot of overused tropes and garbage shows present within anime. There's also plenty of good quality shows out there, and the standout gems of the medium, like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, FMA: Brotherhood etc... are definitely worth watching. "
Fate/Zero,"I like the shonen shit. DBZ, One Piece, Hunter X Hunter, etc. It's a power fantasy and I love seeing how different writers create worlds with their own rules on powers. Plus growing up in the hood it was kind of what everyone bonded over."
Fate/Zero,"Just like TV shows, there is a ton of trash to wade through to find the real gems. I too tire of the tired anime troupe of teenage main characters so it's always refreshing to find one that doesn't use it or at least uses it well."
Fate/Zero,"No, I joke often that 90% of anime is teens without parents wondering the countryside searching for a MacGuffin. 

There are a few, however, that, imo, rise above the tropes of their genre.  I like Samurai Champloo, Attack on Titan, and Devilman: Crybaby."
Fate/Zero,"I've never watched anime and honestly don't know where to start. What would you recommend to someone that knows nothing about this genre?

Edit: thanks for all the replies. I really appreciate it!"
Fate/Zero,"I was hardcore into anime for a while. I’d watch multiple shows per season, binge on classic shows and films that I missed, but then I just got burnt out.



The problem I have with Anime are the tropes. Anime feels trope heavy and I notice the same character types and story beats across way too many shows from multiple genres. I read a quote from someone that worked in the anime industry that said something along the lines of “creators are creating based on what they see in other anime rather than taking cues from life experience” and that really stuck with me. 



Cheap fan service is another issue I have. I got tired of seeing over sexualised characters clearly drawn as if they’re pre-pubescent girls. I hate hearing the “she’s actually 100 years old” excuse, and I hate seeing it in relativly normal shows that don’t need it altogether. I understand Japan has a very different culture than my own and handle this stuff very differently than the west but I have the choice not to support or watch such things so that is what I do (the creator of Ruroni Kenshin [Samurai X] only getting fined $2000 for having collections of indecent images of children told me a lot about how such a thing is perceived over there).



Nowadays my anime intake is way down. I still seek out classics, but when it comes to new shows I wait to see what’s the best shows of the season or the year. I use to watch several new shows a season, now I only watch several new shows a year.



"
Fate/Zero,nope
Fate/Zero,I loved how diverse the anime platform can be. From a hardcore drama like Monster to a funny show like Great Teacher Onizuka. And there are many anime movies that can rival some oscar worthy films. 
Fate/Zero,"I am not too much into 'weeb-y' anime, especially the ecchi genre. I just follow some select anime, which could be qualified as mainstream. It has its fair share of issues, with heavy usage of tropes, generic protagonists (boy does anime has lots of bad and too samey protagonists) and treatment of female characters. 

But at its best, in my opinion when they really hit the mark, I would say that some of the top shows are anime for me.

For me till now, nothing has surpassed the Chimaera Ant arc from Hunter X Hunter, when it comes to storytelling. I still regard it as the best, most detailed stories ever told. Contrary to many people, I loved the use of excessive narration. Gave me a feeling of watching a fictional documentary. When I think about the potential of current superhero fad, I wish someone from Marvel or DC could try making something as complex, engaging and chaotic as Hunter X Hunter Chimaera Ant arc. Because they to have potential to surpass this. 

Gintama too did it best with Shogun Assassination arc. And that was surprising considering that I didn't expect such a engaging plot from Gintama of all thing. 

There are also other anime, which tries to subvert itself at its best. ReZero for example makes the protagonist as despicable and idiotic as possible. But does give a huge deconstruction phase which is something I have never seen anywhere. Then there's Hyoka, which is as mundane as possible and yet manages to tell us a very strong character story."
Fate/Zero,"Im a fan of Astroboy and Robotech from the 80s,but aside from that,not so much."
Fate/Zero,"HUGE fan of a select few anime, Yu Yu Hakusho is my absolute favorite anime of all time with the Dark Tournament Arc being my favorite Arc of all time. "
Fate/Zero,"I did enjoy Parasyte and the first season of Tokyo Ghoul but i realized i have a hard time getting into japanese media in general, like even books by japanese authors feel really different to me."
Fate/Zero,"I'm not obsessed with anime, but I have enjoyed some of them. I thought Death Note was so different from many of the other animes and so creative. For me, that really stands out. It's one of my favorite shows period. 

I feel like Hunter X Hunter, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Naruto, My Hero Academia, and Attack on Titan have some great characters and plot development throughout the series. Naruto does have a lot of filler though that can be skipped. 

Dragon Ball was a lot of fun. There actually is a lot of character development interestingly but you can't take the show too seriously.  It's a good show to watch for fun. "
Fate/Zero,"That's like asking if someone is a fan of live action. There's such a GIGANTIC variety of genres and quality in anime, just like with live action series. What you're saying is basically like someone saying most live action is just like That's So Raven and Hannah Montana, although you did like The Sopranos and Breaking Bad.

>  and apparently the dubs are usually worse anyway.

Well your mileage may vary. English dubs have only gotten better as time has gone on. Like, the original Speed Racer dub isn't great, and early 90s dubs could likewise use some improvement, and then you have some dubbing companies that consistently did terrible work but other companies that delivered quality voice acting and a good script. The stuff put out by Viz and Funimation has always seemed to be of the best quality to me. And frankly one thing that almost all anime actually DO have in common is ridiculously high-pitched voices on at least one character, and the English dubs tend to tone that down. Like, the original Japanese of Azumanga Daioh is basically unlistenable to me because of the high voices, so the dub is nice because they're all pitched down a bit (although you do lose out on them randomly speaking English if you watch it in English).

Also I can't remember the last show I watched that had cheap fanservice and panty flashes. Most of the ones that do that are either old or really poor quality (or both), except like Gurren Lagann that has fan service but is goddamn amazing. 

Having no idea what sort of thing you're into (except that you like some of the most well-regarded series ever), I can't really recommend anything else. You can scour the internet and find best-of lists to find something that might interest you. Gurrenn Lagann like I mentioned above, and Attack on Titan are good and don't have schoolgirls. Except for Attack on Titan: Junior High, which is a parody (I'm not sure it's even an anime, actually)."
Fate/Zero,"I don't think there's much difference in choosing to watch a certain live-action tv show or anime. It's still watching a video and great for you if you enjoy the plot, charcters etc. To a certain degree, you could probably adapt one into the other.  
  
I just watch or finished Ranma ½ and the Yu-Gi-Oh series. "
Fate/Zero,"You have to think of Anime as a medium rather than a genre. There are terrible, tropes-filled shows, and then many with deeper meaning.

Personally, I recommend Haibane Renmei if you want something that is elevated and operates on multiple levels. 

I found Elfen Lied to be rather mature as well. 

If you can allow yourself not to lump every anime series together into one genre, and give each show its own chance, I think you'll have a better experience."
Fate/Zero,"While I’ve enjoyed a few animes here and there, I generally just don’t like how over the top everything is. Sometimes it’s fun, but I wish I could find a show where everyone’s not a super genius badass, where young girls aren’t shrieking and oversexualized, and where the story isn’t some convoluted magic-demon-alien-robot insanity.

I guess the over-the-top nature of anime is part of the appeal, but I just wish I could get something that’s as imaginative as anime without being so ridiculous."
Fate/Zero,"Even anime that are considered ""good"" I just can't get in to. I cannot sanction the buffoonery of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure. Attack on Titan is too grimdark. Most ""serious"" anime just comes off as desperately edgy to me.

I do like gibli, and trigger tho. They put a lot of charm in their animation.

Friends,"I think one of the things that give Seinfeld an edge is that the characters are never presented as good people. They're all shitty and that's part of it. So things that might have been considered benign at the time, but don't  age well are easier to shrug off. Friends continually tries to tell you they're good people and good friends when they're all actually terrible so they just become worse over time."
Friends,"Seinfeld just seemed to have so many things that relate to life in general. Odd given the nature of the show, but I'm always using ""like on Seinfeld"". Double dip, man hands, not that there's anything wrong with it, regifter, opposite George, etc. 

Cripes, just yesterday I saw a dumpster diver eating a donut from the trash and thought of George."
Friends,"“We’re not gay! …Not that there’s anything wrong with that.” 

So many lines were ahead of their time and hold up well."
Friends,Seinfeld by far. To me the cynicism holds up better than the corny sentimentality where everybody hugs and learns a lesson.
Friends,"Seinfeld, it’s indisputable"
Friends,Now start watching Curb your Enthusiasm
Friends,Seinfeld and it's not close. Seinfeld has always been a better show imo.
Friends,Seinfeld has aged better because a lot of the stories are based on every day real life situations. How many times has something happened in your life that made you think of a Seinfeld episode vs how many times has something made you think of Friends?
Friends,[removed]
Friends,"One is the greatest network comedy ever.

the other is Friends.

IMO the writing on Seinfeld was so far ahead of the game people are still catching up."
Friends,"I still love both these shows, and I think they both hold up. 

Friends hit its stride at the end of season 3, when Ross and Rachel really broke up. It seems the writers shifted all the characters into quirky, weird characteristics besides Ross being the lovelorn mopey guy, Monica being the straight woman, Chandler being just a comic relief, etc. This ended up giving the show refreshing storylines to feed off of as opposed to the cookie cutter sitcom it started as.

Seinfeld is similar in that it hit its real stride a few seasons in. All of the characters were gloriously unlikeable yet lovable, but I think Elaine was the real gem in the bunch. I always thought it was pretty brave for JLD to play such a brash character, for a woman comedian it was really refreshing to see her be just as bad as the guys as opposed to being the straight woman trying to keep them in check. Sweet Dee on Sunny is directly influenced by her portrayal. 

Each of these shows have catch phrases that are a part of pop culture, each show is still funny despite knowing what that joke is that you heard for the 20th time. Both are classics, but different types of shows that went against the grain and ended up becoming classics."
Friends,"Ngl. Its interesting seeing some of the replies here as a person from the UK. Seinfeld barely got much of a chance to get going here (dont blame the people, blame the channels over here messing up schedules MAJOR at the time), whereas Friends was and is still HUGE here. Like there's legit a small chain of central perk replica coffee shops here within one of the biggest fashion stores here and you can find friends merch anywhere. 

Like due to that Seinfeld has always felt like this weird hipster show for friends haters to me. ""Oh, you like friends? That's so basic and mainstream. Seinfeld is way better."" and I know elsewhere in the world ESPECIALLY in the US it isn't true. But yeah... its just the way it feels and looks from this side if the planet. 😅"
Friends,The funny one.
Friends,"Lot of Friends hate one here. But honestly, They’re both really great shows that have aged pretty brilliantly. 

One took the sitcom formula and pretty much perfected it. The other took the sitcom formula and found hilarious ways to subvert it. Both shows were exceptionally cast.

I feel like Reddit seems to look at Friends as being hokey and sentimental, but it’s no worse than Parks and Reck and The Office US in that regard and the writing in those early seasons especially was really fresh and clever."
Friends,"People on here have such a huge hate boner for Friends lol

There's a reason it's as popular as it is"
Friends,"Asking reddit to choose between Friends and Seinfeld is a forgone conclusion, the reddit demo will always favor Seinfeld. But if you were to ask randoms on the street, Friends will win out 8 times out of 10.

I like them both but Friends is my comfort show and the one I have rewatched more often."
Friends,"Have 30 somethings at my work place that watch Friends over and over.  One says she has seen every episode at least 15 times.  Seinfeld was smarter and has more memorable lines, but younger generations have not discovered it like they have discovered Friends.  Both funny as hell."
Friends,"It’s highly subjective. 

Growing up with friends felt a lot more digestible and easier to follow. The narcissism of Seinfeld didn’t become clear to me until i was older and able to understand the situation the characters were placed in.

Friends storylines felt a lot more simplified. Universal storytelling vs situational experiences.

Both hold space where needed. 

Overall, for me - Friends aged well as a comfort watch and Seinfeld aged best with personal experiences."
Friends,"Seinfeld ages better because it fused one of the greatest comedy writers ever (Larry David) with three of the greatest performers of their time (Alexander, Richards, Dreyfuss)
No, I didn’t leave out any names here."
Friends,"I don’t even see how the two can compare - friends is a good sitcom, but very low hanging fruit comedy that comes together with likable characters and typical “will they, won’t they” tropes, where as Seinfeld is legit great writing, had timeless jokes, unique characters, and paved the way for shows with terrible characters that have little to no development while still maintaining audience interest.  Just one man’s opinion."
Friends,"My vote is for Seinfeld. But Im going to selfishly take this opportunity to stick up for Friends and fight back against the the online hate that show brings in. 

I am old enough to have appreciated the later seasons live as they aired and to be aware of what a massive phenomenon it was in its day. It was everyone’s favorite show (if I may generalize). I watched all the reruns at 6 and 6:30 every day. By the time the show finished I probably saw the whole series 2 or 3 times over. then I got older and went through the phase of thinking it was uncool, unfunny, and out dated. Then I got even older and it was released on HBO Max and I decided to get nostalgic and start from episode 1. The show is a monumental achievement in entertainment. They created SIX ICONIC characters over 10 seasons with a joke-a-minute prime time sitcom. The actors delivered every time. The roles they played were not easy. If you can’t laugh at Friends then that’s on purpose and you’re just trying to be a contrarian hipster who just won’t like any multicam sitcom. But if you can appreciate the format at all, let go of ego, Friends is funny. 

Seinfeld is better tho 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Friends,"I realize I am really going to cut against the grain here, but I have to answer this question truthfully:

Friends, and it is not even close.

I’m not saying it’s better than Seinfeld because it totally is NOT. But OP said “aged better.” 

I live in NYC and I work in tourism. The number of people I’ve met who are desperate to see the Friends apartment, Friends locations real and fake (no, Central Perk is not a real coffee shop), extends into the hundreds.

I’ve not met a single person who asks me about Seinfeld.

All those Friends fanatics? They are all 20 or younger.

Friends is MASSIVELY popular among Gen Z kids, who find it alternately relatable (because stories are simple and the characters are very archetypal) and exotic (no smartphones or social media, and the characters on Friends not-so-coincidentally seem to have much richer relationships with each other).

Friends has resonated in a major, major way a generation later. Seinfeld has not. Seinfeld is much more specific in its humor and more rooted in 90s history (don’t know who George Steinbrenner and Johnnie Cochran were? Too bad for you!), and I don’t think its very white/Jewish-centric vision of New York, where other ethnicities are typically encountered in service industries or as exotic Others, has aged well for 2020s sensibilities. Does Friends have the white-centric problem, too? Hell yes, even more so, but its edges so sanded and its humor so seemingly benign that I can see why people give it more of a pass.

TL, DR: Friends has a huge Gen Z fanbase, Seinfeld does not. Ergo, Friends has “aged better”, though I agree Seinfeld was a much, much better show."
Friends,"I like both shows, but objectively speaking, I think Seinfeld is far superior.

It just has way more creativity and unique premises and I think writing is superior. Friends is a good sitcom, but I don’t think it necessarily has anything that sets it apart from most other sitcoms as its own thing besides the fountain dancing intro titles and music. I too watched Friends first and thought it was one of the greatest shows ever, but then started seeing Seinfeld and newer shows like Community and Parks and Rex and saw how superior they are.

Seinfeld didn’t need a famous guest star every week, but I think Friends purposely went that route in the latter half largely because I think they knew the writing and characters weren’t strong enough to succeed on its own and triedmto overcompensate with big name guest stars like Willis, Pitt, DeVito, Penn and, Kathleen Turner and Goldblum, among others.

Friends was and is a very ordinary - but entertaining- sitcom with a flashy exterior and good jokes, but didn’t have the substance the way Seinfeld or Parks and Rec or Community or Frasier and many others do. It was always a fun show but I don’t think much more than that."
Friends,Friends is 100x more popular and gets more views. So depends what you want to take into account. This is kinda like avatar where reddit thinks avatar/friends suck but the majority of the world loves avatar/friends.
Friends,Seinfeld is more farcical and Friends has a bit more heart. Maybe I’m getting softer as I get older but I gravitate more towards Friends.
Friends,"*Seinfeld* influenced modern comedy more than *Friends* - Larry David shaped a generation of White guys' sense of humor.
  
*Friends* benefits from having some post-9/11 seasons and just *feels* more modern. Rachel also influenced a whole generation of White girls' wardrobe."
Friends,"Controversial certainly reading the rest of this thread, but I regularly still rewatch Friends, while very little of the humor in Seinfeld does anything for me. (I also love always sunny, which people often compare Seinfeld to).

I think Friends holds up not because of the humor, but in spite of it, it's a very feel good show, it always works out for them and a lot of the struggles are relatable to a 20-30 year old trying to be a grown-up for the first time. When I'm in a bad mood and am ""stuck in second gear"", then it kind of cheers me up, but Seinfeld doesn't do that, and I'd rather watch Always Sunny for the fun hijinks with the absurd stories and bonkers characters, when I'm in the mood for that."
Friends,"Seems a lot people here aren’t answering the question. They’re just answering what do they prefer. As for me, I think Friends has aged better. Seinfeld is a 90s show in its references. Which makes sense obviously as it was almost solely set in the 90s. As someone else said, I think Friends benefits in relation to this question from having some of it set past 9/11, when the world was a different place."
Friends,"Never liked Seinfeld, might be an American thing I never understood. 

Friends was funny at times and woudn't be suprised if some channels sti air episodes. Just like married with children stil airs -.-"
Friends,"This is such a weird argument. One show is a literal milestone of television comedy, the other is a show lots of people seem to enjoy. 

Apples and oranges."
Friends,Reddit leans Seinfeld. But they’re both great
Friends,Seinfeld is funnier to me now as I’m at the age of the characters. Friends was never funny to me regardless of age.
Friends,Seinfeld and it's not particularly close. Seinfeld vs Frasier is a better question.
Friends,"Whichever people choose, I’d say they’re both white."
Friends,"Everything in this thread saying Friends isn’t funny to seem smarter than they are 🙄. Seinfeld is the better show, but the Friends writers room wasn’t slacking and the cast was also great."
Friends,"One invented No Nut November, the other still gets people to clap along to a theme song"
Friends,"Also Kevin Bright who made Friends is a huge asshole. He was an alumni of my school and came around all the time. He always introduced himself as “the guy who made Friends,”… he complained that he didn’t work on sets anymore because everyone was too Pc and wouldn’t let him give them unsolicited massages… and when he would come as a guest for our annual awards show, there had to be a special student assigned to him to make sure he didn’t act creepy to any women."
Friends,Seinfeld. Friends is just white Living Single
Friends,"For the average person probably friends, for redditors, its always seinfeld"
Friends,"Contrary to everyone here, Friends. Seinfeld has far too many pop culture references that someone not from that era wouldnt understand. I was born in the 90s and I don't even get some of the people/references they say. There's no damn way a person born now would get a lot of the jokes. Don't get me wrong, Seinfeld is far better written but it's humor also has a long set up, whereas Friends is that cheap easy humor. You'd actually need to watch a whole episode of Seinfeld and pay attention to it in order to get the payoff, whereas Friends you could leave on the background and still enjoy it."
Friends,"Seinfeld is the obvious answer. Friends is a relic of that old hokey manufactured sitcom vibe. While definitely a more modern take, it has more in common with Cheers than with modern TV.

Seinfeld was so innovative in its style that people literally referred to it as a show about nothing. When you really think about that, it is bizarre. At that time, people needed each episode wrapped in a convenient storyline that taught a lesson to actually perceive storytelling. Seinfeld blew up that notion and allowed characters to exist as morally ambiguous without being ""punished"" (and then when they did get ""punished"" in the finale, the audience felt betrayed). Storylines were less cliched and more based on the small minutia of everyday life and poking holes in the absurdity of modern society -- basically the default tone of most social media platforms these days. It isn't that crazy to draw a line from Seinfeld's take on character to the beginning of prestige TV like The Sopranos and The Wire, when TV audiences finally accepted that it is far more interesting to not be force fed whether a character is a hero or a villain."
Friends,"Seinfeld, always. The show is/was brilliant and could never be replicated."
Friends,Seinfeld. Although I would say Curb is the one that will age like a fine wine.
Friends,"Friends is what Seinfeld would have been if the network had been calling all the development shots: get a couple more girls, make everyone younger and pretty, include a Sam and Diane couple. Given that, Friends was executed very well."
Friends,"Well I've never liked Friends in the first place. 

But Seinfeld is immortal. It's a much more human show."
Friends,Mulva > Unagi
Friends,I always found Seinfeld to be more relatable.
Friends,"One good way is to compare similar episodes. The classic Seinfeld episode about masturbation famously used “master of my domain” as a euphemism to get around network censors. The episode humorously explored the central role that it plays in our lives and differences between men and women, cleverly couched in a friendly contest. A masterpiece of sitcom writing.

The Friends episode “The one about whacking off” is much cruder. The scene where Ross and Chandler are racing to see who finishes on Joey first lacks the nuances of the Seinfeld contest. And the lack of a comparable scene with the girls smacks of early 90s sexism.

Overall it’s very clear which was the greater comedy."
Friends,"Friends has some very dated jokes. Seinfeld has some dated situations (the speed dial episode for example), but the humor is timeless."
Friends,"In my mind there doesn’t need to be a debate as to which is better. I like both shows.

There’s a lot of dislike for Friends here. I don’t know. I think it’s very funny."
Friends,"A lot of Seinfeld was dealing with issues that wouldn't happen anymore, like waiting at a land line for a call or misunderstandings that we instantly solve with a smartphone. Friends was a bunch of people trying to fuck. I think Seinfeld is a way better show but it hasn't aged as well"
Friends,"Seinfeld, without question.

Even though it's a 90s show about 30 somethings, it's still so applicable today and to a broad audience.

I've watched it over and over again throughout the years since I was 12 years old. I'm now approaching 30 and I know all the lines by now, and I'm still laughing and hollering at every episode. It's not like it even had just a few good episodes or seasons, there's so many classics! Heck the festivus episode was in the final season! 

It's just the all-time best comedy show and will always be my all-time favorite TV show. 

FRIENDS is probably only better to a certain demographic."
Friends,"Seinfeld.

The premise of Friends was created by an 8 year old girl. Me and my friends are all going to live in the same place and we can play everyday. Our boyfriends will live in the same building and we can all date when we want too. And everything is going to be really really fun."
Friends,Friends is for the undateable.
Friends,It’s Seinfeld by a mile. Haven’t watched Friends in quite a while but it doesn’t strike me as the type of show that would’ve aged well. Seinfeld is still funny as shit. And relevant.
Friends,"As a HUGE Seinfeld fan, I was pretty pissed when people started comparing these two shows a little while back. In my mind it was even close.

My wife started watching friends again, and I have to admit, it was way better then I remembered. Definitely, not as good as Seinfeld, but it was closer then I thought.

Seinfeld 10/10

Friends 9/10"
Friends,There are rarely days that go by that are not relatable to Seinfeld. It is infinitely more quotable. Seinfeld has a timeless quality that is not matched by Friends. Seinfeld and The Office is a better comparison.
Friends,Seinfeld. Better jokes.
Friends,I watched Friends and loved it for years and then found Seinfeld in 2020 and there simply isn't any comparison for me - Seinfeld is far superior and I love it dearly and watch it every day. I'm bonkos about Seinfeld 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Friends,"Seinfeld was more realistic in their living situation, such as not being able to afford these huge apartments on minimal salary etc. 

Oh and Seinfeld had actual comedy ..."
Friends,"ITT, Seinfeld good, Friends bad."
Friends,"Seinfeld, by far.  It's always relatable and always hilarious.  Friends was good too but the characters are just so.........likeable.  The UN-likability of Seinfeld's characters makes it timeless."
Friends,Friends is really unfunny. It tries too hard and falls flat; the humour is so forced. It also feels dated. Seinfeld is timeless. Far superior on every front.
Friends,"Seinfeld and the Episode in the Hampton’s — have not seen anything better in comedy after that — Seinfeld is the GOAT 😊

Please, you have to see the baaaabbbyyyy 😅"
Friends,"Seinfeld embraced being terrible people and that was part of the appeal (IASIP does this well, too). Friends characters didn’t seem horrible at the time but in retrospect they’re unbearable."
Friends,"how is this even a question? seinfeld by faaaarrr

friends is a show set in new york fucking city and it features ONLY white people. wtf is that?"
Friends,Seinfeld is the Goat!!
Friends,I think both are for different crowds. You probably won't ever get an unbiased answer. Not that there's anyone wrong with that!
Friends,"Friends was never funny, All the actors are now washed up and trying to stay relevant. Didnt the show try to reboot and flop? I dont think I've ever met anyone who actually liked the show and wasnt above the age of 40. And that was a long time ago.

everyone I know who has seen sienfeld still loves it, and my family and I watch it together sometimes. Even though it can be mundane and dated at times, it still holds up really well"
Friends,Seinfeld by far. I used to be a staunch friends stan when I was a teenager but damn it's near unwatchable now.
Friends,"Friends =  characters have redeeming values.

Seinfeld = no one has any redeeming values. 

Seinfeld all day."
Friends,Seinfeld. Friends has always been trash.
Friends,"Since Seinfeld was WAY better while it aired, it’s also better now. That’s my crazy take."
Friends,"You’re asking this on the internet, my friend. The overwhelming consensus is going to be Seinfeld. By a wide margin."
Friends,"friends comes off super fake now. they also seem much older then they are. 
its bizarre to me that ""a show about nothing"" was an unheard of concept and i suppose at the time ahead of its time. even though i thought seinfeld was lame (i didnt get it) as a kid its aged better. 
although it was hilarious that teens thought friends was a new netflix show. then target ruined everything by merchandising it to DEATH"
Friends,"Friends turned into a bunch of Adults acting like dumb teens living in conditions they can't effort with their incomes in a New York that doesn't exist as they present it while handling unrelatable shit in unrealistic ways. I never liked friends and personally find it one of the most overrated shows in the history of television. Seinfeld however is very relatable and realistic which besides the set feeling outdated (yet good for the time they made it) making it sort of a timeless show, the jokes and situations still work."
Friends,"I like them both. Friends is too nostalgic for me. But Seinfeld probably ages the best as it is a show about nothing. :D

Also, my fav sitcom from the ""old days"" is probably Fraiser. Seen it first time few years back and it is amazing."
Friends,"Seinfeld is still relevant. Everyone has had a bad parking experience or been ""Happy New Year""'ed in Feb."
Friends,Seinfeld. By miles
Friends,Sinefield.  Curb is still a great show with a similar concept.
Friends,Seinfeld is timeless and still holds up. Friends is almost unwatchable now.
Friends,Friends was shit when it came out
Friends,"Friends, but it’s not necessarily because it’s a better show. So many shows have taken what Seinfeld did and built on it or downright stolen from it.

As a person who has watched both, I laugh more at Friends. When I watch Seinfeld, I understand that it is funny, but I’m able to predict where it’s going because modern sitcoms have been shaped by it to the point that my thought process is able to jump to the punchline before it happens on screen. 

This is so common that there’s a whole page on TV Tropes about it: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny"
Friends,"Seinfeld, 100%"
Friends,Seinfeld. The jokes are actually still funny. Friends..... not so much.
Friends,I don't find Seinfeld even remotely funny.  Maybe it's because I'm British?
Friends,I never cared for Seinfeld.
Friends,"Seinfeld’s characters are not sympathetic. We like them in spite of who they are. Friends’s characters are by comparison very sympathetic. We like them in spite of what they *do*.

I think the easiest comparison is how each show handles the rampant homophobia of the 90s. Friends leans fully into it, with all the characters unabashedly making gay jokes. When Seinfeld did the same topic, they added ‘not that there’s anything wrong with it.’ The characters are aware they’re in the wrong on Seinfeld and on Friends they are not aware they are."
Friends,Friends is living single for white people. Seinfeld is very good but dated and doesnt resonate with gen z like friends does. The real GOAT 90s sitcom will always be Frasier.
Friends,"Friends. When was the last time you saw Seinfeld bath salts for sale?

Friends is the ultimate American style sitcom, while Seinfeld is a B+ approximation of a British style sitcom (which is why it never had an impact there). Friends is a huge global property and I guarantee at least one episode is screening on TV somewhere as you read this. Seinfeld not so much. What’s up with that? Could it *be* any clearer?"
Friends,"Jerry this is frank, mr steinberger is here, George is dead, call me back.

This line alone is better than friends"
Friends,Friends has a better looking cast and is a brighter show. Those things always age better as comfort watches.
Friends,Sienfield is much better.
Friends,From reading the comments it looks like I’ll be binge watching Seinfeld . 😊
Friends,Workaholics… I said what I said.
Friends,"Seinfeld is 10000x better than Friends. Even when Friends was on tv it wasn’t very funny. Seinfeld works because it deals with very real everyday themes but through the experiences of intentionally unlikeable characters. It’s about the discomfort of social interaction, the perpetual adolescence encouraged by urban life, the mundaneness of most work, the sheer amount of luck involved in finding jobs, family relationships… Friends characters tried to be likeable but were totally unbelievable because of it. They’re all beautiful and fashionable, whereas the cast of Seinfeld is fairly average looking (well Elaine is gorgeous but she dresses in a very particular way and has naturally curly hair and her real nose etc). Friends characters had mostly low paying jobs but rarely talked about money, whereas Seinfeld had entire episodes about finding good deals on rent. George had to move in with his parents when he was unemployed. It just feels more relatable. The fat Monica jokes on friends are really tasteless and cruel. Jokes about George Constanza being portly and bald feel very human—his value is not fully attributed to his attractiveness, he still dates and gets laid, and when women reject him it typically has more to do with his personality and poor behavior than his appearance. Friends was accused of being too white for NYC but I don’t think ever responded to that. Seinfeld, with the same accusation, made a hilarious episode about George trying to find a Black friend to prove he wasn’t racist. The writing in Seinfeld is just…excellent. I could go on and on about it, but I think it’s no contest at all. Friends was a blah sitcom that aged poorly. Seinfeld was an excellent sitcom with great writing, and while some jokes don’t make sense with current technology (eg stealing answering machine tapes), it doesn’t really matter."
Friends,"I feel like FRIENDS has aged a tiny bit better. Let me explain.


FRIENDS is a show about a group of friends going through life, from early 20s to real adulthood with complicated relationships, kids, etc. A ton of the writing still holds up IMO. The negative of the show is that its VERY typical sitcom. A bit formulaic, especially in later seasons. But we do get to see the characters grow, develop, without compromising TOO much on what made them funny. Joey and Feebie are probably the only 2 characters that suffered a ton of Flanderisation.

SEINFELD on the other hand has MUCH sharper writing and the humor is a lot more nuanced. Where SEINFELD drops the ball is that its very much a product of its time. Half of the show would not work if the characters had smartphones. Simple as that. I mean, come on dudes, there is a whole episode revolving around swapping the cassette of an answering machine. 

This is all objective in my opinion tho. I personally enjoyed Seinfeld humor a lot more. Some of the jokes take a whole episode to be set up, with a payoff as the last line of the episode. That's not easy to pull off. And this is from a guy who grew up on Friends when it was airing. I only caught SEINFELD on Netflix. Also, George Costanza is a spirit animal and one of the most glorious characters to ever grace a TV screen"
Friends,Always sunny in Philadelphia
Friends,"Friends, simply because I never really cared for Seinfeld."
Line of Duty,Love love loved this show. Season 2 is one of my favorite seasons of any show.
Line of Duty,"Hmmm.. going to have to move it up in the list.

Waking the Dead is a British television police procedural crime drama series, produced by the BBC, that centres on a fictional London-based Cold Case unit composed of CID police officers, a psychological profiler and a forensic scientist. A pilot episode aired in September 2000, and a total of nine series followed. Each story is split into two hour-long episodes, shown on consecutive nights on BBC One. A third series episode won an International Emmy Award in 2004. The programme was also shown on BBC America in the United States, though these screenings are edited to allow for advertising breaks, as well as UKTV in Australia and New Zealand and ABC1 in Australia. A total of 46 stories aired across the nine series. The show aired its final episode on 11 April 2011. A spin-off from the series, titled The Body Farm, revolving around forensic scientist Eve Lockhart (Tara Fitzgerald), was announced by the BBC in January 2011 and ran for just one series."
Line of Duty,i didn't know season 5 had started airing. hell yeah
Line of Duty,"I adore this show, have rewatched it a couple of times."
Line of Duty,Love Unforgotten. Excited for Season 5. Disappointed that it doesn't seem to be available to watch in the U.S. yet.
Line of Duty,"I agree, Unforgotten is a great show. What I like most about it is that it takes it's time to tell the story. For the first few episodes you see the individual suspects leading normal lives that are far different from each other. You really do wonder how they are all connected, and how they tie in with the cold case murder. It's quite an engaging premise."
Line of Duty,"Just me, but while *Unforgotten* is good, it's not at all on the level of *Happy Valley.*  The show you send *Happy Valley* fans to is *Unforgiven* (and maybe *Scott & Bailey*), since they're all written by Sally Wainwright.

I'm also not 100% sure that *Unforgotten* is necessarily going to appeal that much to the *Line of Duty* crowd, who probably want more Jed Mercurio (*Bodies, The Bodyguard, Critical).* 

To me, *Unforgotten* is kinda more for the *Silent Witness* crowd. And I'm still reserving judgement on Season 5, given that Nicola Walker's Cassie Stuart is no longer the central character."
Line of Duty,"The first four series of Unforgotten are incredible, up there with my favourite ever. Especially 2 and 4.

However, for me, Series 5 was a massive disappointment. I thought it had been written by someone different. It felt incompetently made."
Line of Duty,Agreed! Cassie is one of my favourite characters.
Line of Duty,Nice - I'll check it out.
Line of Duty,Airing on Mondays and all available to binge on the ITV Hub - no idea why they did this!
Line of Duty,"the new ITV X policy I guess, I just binged it all in one afternoon."
Line of Duty,"I was disappointed in the last season, but we absolutely need another one. Please do renew! Really enjoy this show. Bent coppas!"
Line of Duty,Haven't read this article. But it definitely felt like the door was being left open for an eventual return a few years down the line.
Line of Duty,"Now we’re sucking diesel. 

Let the worship of the gaffer continue strong."
Line of Duty,"I don’t usually like police dramas but I thought I’d give it a go and watched the first episode. Binge watched the whole lot within a week up to the latest episodes. It’s a brilliantly well done show. 

The only thing I can’t figure out is why they had Arnott wear a waistcoat around the office all the time without a jacket so he looked like a snooker player here is [examples](https://i.imgur.com/xzW1e28.jpg)"
Line of Duty,"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and the wee donkey."
Line of Duty,[deleted]
Line of Duty,"Good, it’s a phenomenal fucking series."
Line of Duty,Special mention for Anna Maxwell Martin as DCS Patricia Carmichael. Makes my skin crawl when she gives that little smile.
Line of Duty,"Such a big fan of Vicky McClure, ever since this is England which is my all time favourite series"
Line of Duty,Line of Duty has the right to be challenged by a series one rank its senior...sadly there is none.
Line of Duty,This season has been so good beeeeeeeeeeeeep
Line of Duty,Ya wee gob shite
Line of Duty,[removed]
Line of Duty,"This show is some how equally well acted, well written, gripping & suspenseful; whilst also being totally bonkers and eye wateringly stupid. Love it!"
Line of Duty,“Gotcha a big pint of that cats’ piss that you young fellas seem to like so much.”
Line of Duty,who the fuck is HAEICH??????????
Line of Duty,"For the DIR, I nod my head in agreement"
Line of Duty,Nicking bent coppers 🚓
Line of Duty,"I don't care about this, I only care about catching bent coppers!"
Line of Duty,"I’ve never seen this show, but I fucking love Downton abbey and I don’t know why. 

It’s basically me and a bunch of 50 year old women in the fan club but I god damn love it."
Line of Duty,I didn't float up the Lagan in a bubble
Line of Duty,I haven't watched it but it's rated higher than BODYGUARD? That show is stupidly good so line of duty must be out of this world
Line of Duty,"Howl yer whist, lad!"
Line of Duty,"I’ll watch anything with Kelly Macdonald. From Trainspotting to Boardwalk Empire, the woman steals scenes."
Line of Duty,"Glad that this is making it’s way here! I always found it weird how it does huge numbers in the UK, but doesn’t have any real impact elsewhere"
Line of Duty,h
Line of Duty,Is it possible to watch in EU (outside GB)?
Line of Duty,I have Acorn thru my library and noticed it was on there !
Line of Duty,Bodyguard needs to return
Line of Duty,"Bodyguard was great but I’m not sure if they can do it without sexy Mrs Durrell.

line of duty is also excellent, I particularly liked psycho Mrs Durrell. 

I don’t watch downtown as it doesn’t have Mrs Durrell in it."
Line of Duty,"It slips into melodrama occasionally and it's past its peak, but it's always fun."
Line of Duty,"If I don't like procedurals, will I still like this? I enjoyed Bodyguard."
Line of Duty,"If I'm an American who has never watched a British television show, would the slang confuse the hell out of me ?"
Line of Duty,"I watched the first season and really enjoyed it besides the ending. I’ve watched the first couple episodes of season 2 and just could not get into it. I’ve tried watching episode 3 multiple times and it can’t keep my attention. I plan on going back to it eventually, I’ve heard season 2 & 3 are fan favorites. But I have to say I’m a bit disappointed considering the high praise the series gets. So far I’m a bit baffled at people calling it the “British wire.” Other than being about police, they are nothing alike."
Line of Duty,"I guess I’m the odd one out because I just can’t get into this show and I’ve given it several tries. The twists don’t surprise me, the deaths don’t surprise me, and every season feels incomplete, like a story that never quite knows how to end so it’s just dragging on. Don’t hate me."
Line of Duty,"Is it on US Netflix? If not, where can I find it? I need something in the queue after Shadow and Bone."
Line of Duty,Loin uv dew-ee
Line of Duty,"Last night was probably the worst ep of this series, went absolutely nowhere, but overall it’s been a good ‘un."
Line of Duty,The bodyguard was SHIT.
Line of Duty,Shame it's been on a steady decline in terms of writing quality since the end of s3 at least.  The whole H saga has been a disaster.
Line of Duty,When/where will it get streamed in the US?
Line of Duty,"I tried to watch this, and it was so dry I couldn't get past the first episode."
Line of Duty,Didn’t read the article. Judging from the picture I’m assuming Downton Abbey has reached the modern era cause the two lady cops look modern.
Line of Duty,[removed]
Line of Duty,[deleted]
Line of Duty,and these are...television shows?
Line of Duty,Hahaha Line of Doodie. Leave it to the Brits to watch that.
Line of Duty,Now we're sucking on diesel!!
Line of Duty,"Bring that shit to Hulu or Netflix or HBOmax or something. Prime works, too."
Line of Duty,Is this the show on AMC in America?
Line of Duty,I need to continue my binge of this. I do not know why I stopped
Line of Duty,How would you compare this to another British show? I've never seen it
Line of Duty,"Watched all of it last week for the first time.

Mother of God, what a great show."
Line of Duty,Love this show.
Line of Duty,Long gone the days of waiting for casualty or home and away to come on TV. Hell dare I even say goodbye eastenders
Line of Duty,CHIS
Line of Duty,They really wrote kates character into the ground. Hopefully turns around last episode
Line of Duty,Starting watching this show last week and loving it. Let's catch some bent coppers
Line of Duty,"Those that have seen both, how does it compare to Happy Valley? Happy Valley is easily the best British cop drama I’ve watched so far."
Line of Duty,"I've watched 2 so far. As an American viewer I'm surprised on how free you guys are to show violence and death on TV. Those scenes in the first 2 episodes wouldn't be on what we call broadcast TV but rather premium channels like HBO, showtime, stars"
Line of Duty,"Definately deserves the numbers.

Although I had a feeling this might be the last season after the other night maybe it's still got some legs in it yet for another"
Line of Duty,I wonder if you count worldwide if it still beats Downton.
Line of Duty,Is that Kelly Macdonald?
Line of Duty,Look like I might have to give this show a go.
Line of Duty,I still love how they haven't fixed the interview room's tape machine.

Line of Duty,What a show
Line of Duty,"For a creator who sets his stall out on accuracy, it is so inaccurate that it is painful."
Line of Duty,Series 6 has been bland as fuck.
Line of Duty,"Just finished the first season. Didn't expect it to only be 6 episodes.  

Also found it interesting how it ended, given, that the anti corruption unit basically commits corruption in reporting DCI Gates death as line of duty. I guess it is okay to be corrupt if the guy ""saves your life"" (since he arranged DS Arnott kidnapping and torture)."
Line of Duty,You talk of the Gaffer but there's only one thing i'm interested in...
Line of Duty,"Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the wee baby donkey."
Line of Duty,How dare you insult the wee lads waistcoat!
Line of Duty,"I listened to an interview with Martin Compston (who plays Steve) and I'm sure he said something along the lines of he used to work in a Call Center and his manager was a ""wee wanker who wore a waistcoat to his job everyday"" and he wanted to channel that energy into Steve haha! 

(In the defense of the ""wee wanker"" I used to always wear a waistcoat when I had to dress formal to the office to hide the fact that I have a wee dumpy top half and then gigantic long legs so maybe he was doing the same haha!)

I can't remember the source for it but I think it was maybe the Two Shot Podcast which is a Podcast hosted by Craig Parkinson, who played Dot Cotton, who interviews actors each episode (of course there are loads of episodes with Line Of Duty actors getting interviewed and I would highly recommend in general!)"
Line of Duty,">The only thing I can’t figure out is why they had Arnott wear a waistcoat around the office all the time without a jacket so he looked like a snooker player examples

Thank you for this. XD"
Line of Duty,There's just something about British police procedurals that is soothing. Maybe the setting. And also the fact that UK tv cops are not out the gate 100 level aggressive like on American TV.  Not always the accents though.
Line of Duty,"I had originally thought it was originally to hide a back brace after he got all messed up. But doing a quick scan back to the earlier episodes I've come to the conclusion he must have been 12 years old when the series first started. Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the wee baby donkey they all look so damn young in the first series. He probably stared wearing the vest because they wanted him to look like a grown up."
Line of Duty,I like the green one - it has dragonflies on it. 😃
Line of Duty,Probably either hiding a back brace or the reason why he is such an unlikely studmuffin https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=43qt3FrZh4s
Line of Duty,Arnott and Southgate reclaimed the waistcoat from a miserable existence in Snooker with bow-fucking-ties.
Line of Duty,[deleted]
Line of Duty,"So what is it about and how is it different from say Lucifer or Miami Vice?

Edit: the downvotes indicate these are not favored shows in the UK lol
But no one has answered my question... Would be nice to hear what makes this new show worthwhile.."
Line of Duty,My fiancé says he looks like a magician

Doctor Stranger,I will take one It's Always Sunny and The Office please.
Doctor Stranger,"I sometimes wished TV universes worked the same as comic book universes, and whatever happened on one network show happened in all of them (not feasible, but a fun idea). In that vein, I always wanted a Bones/House crossover episode."
Doctor Stranger,"I don’t agree in crossovers necessarily if you can just create great episodes without getting ahold of characters from another show and doing them purely for ratings or buzz, but if done for the right reasons (world-building, to please your show’s core fan base, writers doing their homework to do it right and putting the work in, etc.)

I liked the Buffy-Angel crossovers because they made sense thematically, logistically and in the storylines at the time. The Simpsons-Futurama crossover, not so much, although it was still a good episode but felt the material and being the length of a standard episode didn’t do such an historical first meeting justice.

As far as potential crossovers that would have been nice **if** they could make sense and not done just as a cheap ratings ploy, I’d say a 30 Rock-Community crossover would have been fun (you have a connection with Donald Glover and airing on the same network at around the same time for a portion of their runs).

Others include:

Parks and Rec meeting The Office

Arrested Development-Schitt’s Creek

Buffy-The X-Files (the latter had at least one episode with a story focusing on vampires)

Stargate SG-1 and The X-Files

Stranger Things-Back to the Future (it would have interfered with ST’s acknowledgment of ‘80s pop culture and possibly contradicted some of what I said earlier, but would have been cool if there was a way it could make sense in story to maybe have Doc Brown for instance show up and play an important role)"

Doctor Stranger,"Donald Glover has spoken about Dave. And while he has said he enjoys it, I wouldn't call his comments too positive when people mention Atlanta and Dave being similar. He hates when people compare the two and basically that Dave has an aspect of being artificial and less organic. He doesn't like that people kind of paired the two shows up as being similar beyond the surface level. He used wagyu steak and a burger as an example, saying that, while both can be enjoyable, people should be able to tell the difference.


So that was DOA even if other people tried to make it happen. Donald wouldn't be interested."

Doctor Stranger,I could definitely see that.
Doctor Stranger,You know that's right.
Doctor Stranger,Disney keeps hiring these hack writers and directors for everything. Mando is good bc of filoni and what's his head
Doctor Stranger,"The wrong writer, director, composer, etc. But also all of their work was compromised by the rushed production schedule. They did not have enough time to make this good. Disney was not willing to wait because they wanted content for Disney Plus."
Doctor Stranger,"It was intended to be a movie, but Solo flopped, so with the success of Clone Wars, Mando, they decided to try a show, and that seems to have been it’s downfall. They appear to have fleshed out the original movie script. There’s a cut online called the Patterson cut, which turns the show into a 2(ish) hour movie, and I watched it last night. There’s a few things they miss out that they shouldn’t have, a few things they add that they probably didn’t need to (the opening scene is clearly made in Blender). But overall, it comes across as a much faster paced, more coherent film, and this is from someone who (mostly) enjoyed Kenobi as a show."
Doctor Stranger,"We all know exactly who’s at fault here Kathleen Kennedy is a plague to lucasfilm. I literally want to see George Lucas get sat down and asked “how do you think KK has handled Star Wars”…this was pretty much the first series with no Dave filoni or Jon favreau. No Dave or Jon and this is obviously the result of that. The mandalorian gets amazing reviews and they go “let’s get someone we barely can trust to write and direct the show of a more important character than mando” Pretty simple that not letting Jon in on ANYTHING in the studio is suicide. Why did they extend her contract after the awful sequel trilogy?, who knows! How do you push out the last Jedi and still have a Job? Lol. I’m actually enjoying watching Disney self sabotage themselves at this point it’s the only joy we’re gonna get until they at least fire Kathleen or give the rights and let Lucas arts have ACTUAL creative decisions in their content or their shares will drop immensely. They need to cleanse the entire studio and let jon and Dave take over. I prefer jon. Jon is hopefully on pace to stealing KK job because obi wan got ratioed to hell and it vanished as fast as it came. No one is talking about it. Baby yoda memes are still circulating after years and I haven’t seen a single obi wan meme other than ones that are roasting it to death. Poor ewan and Hayden they deserved better. I wish they didn’t take the gig and demanded more competence. Obi the wan is the second worst Disney Star Wars push out right behind the last Jedi."
Doctor Stranger,You can only polish a turd so much! Disney has been polishing the Star Wars franchise day and night since acquisition. Why would you expect high quality and novel storytelling at this point?
Doctor Stranger,They should have just done a young Leia and Reva show. That was the stories they wanted to tell and it would have worked better without Obi Wan. Imagine Bail hired Hondo and his crew to get Leia back. Would have been glorious.
Doctor Stranger,"They didn't bet enough ($$$) in Obi-wan I think and yeah Solo was a factor in this regard.

They shoot themselves in the face ,not because the series flopped (it's actually bringing superb numbers overshadowing mandalorian and boba records)  but because it definitely could have work as a movie."
Doctor Stranger,It's because Disney can and will continue to put shit out and most fans will gobble it up and ask for seconds. They clearly aren't even trying anymore with some of their IP. Saw the leaked Mandalorian season 3 trailer and can't believe it came from the same studio as Kenobi.
Doctor Stranger,"disney just pushes content, not ideas.

as long as the content checks all the woke boxes, its good. ideas, stories, character development, logic are irrelevent.

if the content reviews poorly, just accuse the critic of being [identity]phobic.

rinse, repeat."
Doctor Stranger,Made by a bunch of girls.  That's why.
Doctor Stranger,"I'd say a undiagnosed anerism, possibly tumor. Or maybe your internet dropped you to 360p or something partway through the series."
Doctor Stranger,And yet Deborah Chow was praised for her great Mando episodes she directed.
Doctor Stranger,Why is this getting downvoted? Who is so fragile that they can't even tolerate this basic level of opinion/criticism?
Doctor Stranger,"Redditors just push comments, not thought.

Just so long as they hit enough buzzwords, it's good. Sense, logic, thought, are irrelevant.

If they get push back on their comment just accuse someone of being a shill.

rinse, repeat."
Doctor Stranger,"What is woke about this show? Because there is a black character?

If the existence of black people makes you think something Woke, you are simply a racist."
Doctor Stranger,"I think because Star Wars fandom is politically polarized and one of the issues this hinges on is support or hatred for the Disney era of Star Wars content. I've been both hot and cold on it, depending on the project. But also some people love this show. I really wanted to."
Doctor Stranger,"Curious, not that I'm personally up-voting or down-voting anything, but how can you tell when another post is down-voted when it's still above 0 up-votes?"
Doctor Stranger,"You're not a shill, just part of the echo chamber"
Doctor Stranger,Oh I am?
Doctor Stranger,Sold 👍 I definitely want to watch it now. Thanks ✌️
Doctor Stranger,"I thoroughly enjoyed your post. Cheers to you. My wife and I watch the last minute of this show every day because it airs before Jeopardy, which we record, and our recording is set to pick up a minute or two of the preceding taping. We mock drew constantly despite literally only seeing her thank her guests and encouraging them to “take the show” with them into the world. She seems insufferable"
Doctor Stranger,"Thanks, it doesn't sound great, based on what you've written. At the same time, you've convinced me to watch an episode. 

This deluge of content can only go on so long, eventually this will not be viable to produce once the streaming wars have settled."
Doctor Stranger,"....you know you didn't have to watch it, right?"
Doctor Stranger,So you didn’t like it?
Doctor Stranger,"Rolly? Would that be Raleigh, or is there a town called Rolly in North Carolina?"
Doctor Stranger,She’s just not very charismatic IRL.
Doctor Stranger,"It's on the TV at work whenever I go on break. It's the only channel we get clearly and I'm thinking about lighting the TV on fire.

For every guest, she has to hug them uncomfortably long and threaten them with an overbearing amount of compliments. Her co-host Ross Mathews is carrying the show, he actually seems genuine and more comfortable and natural. The opposite of Drew.

If I ever want to feel uncomfortable, cringe, and embarrassment; I watch the Drew Barrymore Show"
Doctor Stranger,"Came across this reddit post while jokingly asking my phone **WHY is Drew Barrymore SO annoying?**

I don't watch the show, never will, but have to suffer through relentless commercials for the show, plus her advertisement for the Bingo app. 
Having to see this lady anywhere drives me absolutely bonkers, everything about her literally annoys the crap outta me.

And for the defenders of her; again, I wouldn't care except she's EVERYWHERE, lol!"
Doctor Stranger,"I just watched this show today and you summed it up perfectly. I can’t believe this show is on the air. Not only is it awkward and bland, the yellow makes it physically painful to watch."
Doctor Stranger,Imagine taking the time to write and post this
Doctor Stranger,>additude
Doctor Stranger,"Until they get the formula right,  meanderingwill continue."
Doctor Stranger,"What’s your opinion of the Kardashians?

Never acted, never sang, One of them did a porn video that got on the Internet and now there all billionaires"
Doctor Stranger,Attitude*
Doctor Stranger,I loved this post.
Doctor Stranger,"Thank you!! I agree, ...........I liked her before this show."
Doctor Stranger,"> I cannot say what she based this ""Mitzy"" abomination off of,

Ripped off Caroline Aherne's Mrs Merton."
Doctor Stranger,"She had a really really rough childhood. With that said, the show is very cringe and hearing her speak is annoying"
Doctor Stranger,"Australian here found this post after googling “is drew Barrymores show the worst?” I had watched 3 minutes then was so putt off I turned off my laptop and left my apartment, almost to get as far away from Drew Barrymore as humanly possible.
I’ve since flicked through a few different episodes and personally for me I believe it’s her voice that is what makes me feel so disengaged.
I’m fine with American accents but hearing an adult speak almost like a child (almost baby voice) and with what sounds to me to be a very Californian drawl accent is what really does it for me.
I find it uncomfortable and hysterical that she needs to touch people as soon as she meets them, however her couch and her guests couch are ridiculously so far apart, which I imagine is so she can’t touch them continuously..
Unfortunately Drew Barrymore not being canceled immediately after the first pilot episode should be a warning to all Americans, a warning assumption of what the rest of the world thinks you’re like."
Doctor Stranger,"She’s manic.  I can’t handle the manic baby doll voice and ohh my goddddddddds.  It certainly does seem to be all about her, too which is incredibly obnoxious.    I’ll watch it sometimes for the wtf factor but I can’t understand how it’s lasted this long.  Bring back Santa Clarita Diet!"
Doctor Stranger,"“Drew” has been green lighted for a third season with an average view-ship of 1.2 million per episode. I pondered,”Why?” So I thought maybe she’s 1) a producer or 2) the afternoon time slot is unmarketable. I’m lost as to why this dumpster dive of a talk show is still assaulting our airwaves much more our senses."
Doctor Stranger,You nailed it exactly 💯! Hearing her voice makes me want to cut my ears off! Watching her is worse than watching Barney the dinosaur. Now they have her screaming like a banchee on that damn bingo blitz commercial. Ugh! I literally can't stand her! I don't understand how she gets any kind of work behind a camera that puts her on TV! For real people don't want to see her- she has ZERO Talent!
Good Doctor,"It’s because all of those things were already (somewhat well-known) idiomatic phrases in English. 

Even a quick google search shows me plenty of examples for each. “The good doctor” is sometimes used ironically, sometimes not, and has been for many years; “the good wife” had different origins but seems in the mid-20th century to have come to refer to the sort of model American wife; “good cop” is more common as it is used in the phrase “good cop/bad cop” so it isn’t quite as big of a stretch; “good place” is the similar to “good cop” because it’s used in juxtaposition with “the bad place,” which is mostly used as a way to avoid saying “hell” for people who think that’s a swear word, and it’s just extrapolated from that; “the good witch” has probably been around for a while but was popularized by *The Wizard of Oz* and Glinda, the Good Witch. This probably doesn’t cover *all* the shows named like this, and I definitely think there’s some synchronicity to the whole thing, but it isn’t necessarily just lazy writing/naming.

TL;DR: these examples in particular are just existing English phrases (or parts of common phrases)."
Good Doctor,"The Good Place...

Good is the new American. Everything used to start with American."
Good Doctor,The Good Universe is one of the more underrated cinematic universes.
Good Doctor,"I remember during the 2010’s that every movie begin with Bad …

Bad Santa
Bad Cops
Bad Teacher
Bad Neighbours
Bad Grandpa"
Good Doctor,"In the case of *The Good Wife* and *The Good Fight* specifically, it's because the shows are a series."
Good Doctor,"The reason for this is that there are a lot of common phrases which start with ""The Good/Good"". Let's go through your list: 

The Good Doctor, a very common olde timey way of greeting a doctor, ""Ah look, here comes the good doctor now.""

The Good Cop, good cop bad cop interrogation tactics, a very common trope.

The Good Witch, a reference to Wizard of Oz.

The Good Place, a common term used to refer to heaven.

The only one I can't think of a phrase for is Good Wife, but that is probably created by self-referencing the ""Good"" trope."
Good Doctor,"Better standard of show beginning “Black…”

Black Monday, Black Mirror, Black Books, Blackadder, Black Sails, Black Bird

Orange is definitely NOT the new Black."
Good Doctor,[deleted]
Good Doctor,Bandwagon. Once someone does something that works it's milked to death.
Good Doctor,"New trend: names of shows just being the year. 1899, 1923,"
Good Doctor,"Because the Bad Doctor, the Bad Cop, the Bad Wife, just sound like real life."
Good Doctor,"And why do we need to see the ""Rise of"" so many things?"
Good Doctor,"It's a common linguistic structure. 

In the case of these shows, there seems to be an element of irony or dramatic tension to it. They're either not about ""good"" people (good wife, good cop) or about a type that isn't typically good (good witch)."
Good Doctor,TIL there’s a show called The Good Witch.
Good Doctor,"TV/Hollywood have a bad time in general at naming their shows.

I mean as soon as i saw Avatar: The Way of Water i rolled my eyes."
Good Doctor,[deleted]
Good Doctor,Show runners aren't that clever with titles?
Good Doctor,"not sure, but probably because it's a word anyone knows the world over and so it is immediately recognisable, not necessarly indicating that the x character is good per se though

talking about The Good Wife, man, ain't Julianna Margulies one of the most beautiful women on the planet? Her face is literally perfect, that smile can melt concrete"
Good Doctor,"Right up there with show names that end in ""ish."""
Good Doctor,I don’t know but The Good Cop underrated for real… not just cause I was on it
Good Doctor,Good is good which people like
Good Doctor,"Nothing except what the show is trying to put forth. Not any different than putting the word new, bad, etc in front of something."
Good Doctor,"The Good American is certainly coming. /s

For American, wasn't it mostly the American Crime/Horror Story saga mostly."
Good Doctor,This is the best one though
Good Doctor,The dot is what broke me.
Good Doctor,"the good wife was a reference to the ""good"" wives standing by their man at press conferences as they apologized for cheating on them."
Good Doctor,"""Goodwife"" is also an old timey way to speak of a married woman. Sometimes shortened to ""Goody""."
Good Doctor,Or The Girl...
Good Doctor,better than colon origins.
Good Doctor,"It's actually just ""Good Witch"" if you are talking about the tv show.

""The Good Witch"" refers to a series of Hallmark movies that the show is based on."
Good Doctor,It's on Hallmark.
Good Doctor,edit your comment please. you have no right to spoil.
Good Doctor,"Pretty sure every show that ends with “-ish” is related (Black-ish, Mixed-ish & Grown-ish). Correct me if I’m wrong though"
Good Doctor,"Isn't that just sort of a calling card-type thing to evoke shows from one particular creator? I can't think of anything that ends in ""ish"" which isn't from that person."
Good Doctor,I loved the good cop

Good Doctor,The Old Man...
Good Doctor,"You are being downvoted but that person just spoiled arguably the biggest twist of The Good Place, I guess it's unlikely that anyone who reads it is likely to watch it"
Good Doctor,Yeah they're all literally spin-offs...
Good Doctor,Oh heck yeah nice! I’m Ryan lol
Good Doctor,"The Americans. 

Also, after reading your list the world American seems weird."
Good Doctor,[deleted]
Good Doctor,American Sniper
Good Doctor,The Farty Adventures…
Good Doctor,"since instead of editing it they decided to downvote me, i m assuming its not a mistake but deliberate.

bad people everywhere there is nothing we can do about it. and yeah that moment was golden. the good place is really good series and i wouldnt want that spoiler for any of new audience."
Good Doctor,Dude no freaking way! Ryan is absolutely hilarious
Good Doctor,The World American (2023)
Good Doctor,no i didn't. its between American Gods and American Crime Story
Good Doctor,"First off, I don’t even think what they posted can be considered a spoiler. Second, even if it was, that doesn’t make them a bad person lmao. And third, the first season of TGP is almost five years old, I’d say that’s plenty of time for people to have watched it if they wanted to; the internet as a whole can’t be expected to tiptoe around spoilers forever"
Good Doctor,Ah damn thank you! Andy Breckman really wrote a perfect character for me lol
Good Doctor,"that kinda thinking ugh... no time limits for anything. and you can always talk spoiler free. or you can cover it. we re not getting your money for it. and yes if they cant see or dont wanna see how they can ruin someone elses joy for the series with some unnecessary information, they are bad people. and yes >!telling wife is not good might not be spoiler but telling good place is not a good place!< is major spoiler."
Good Doctor,So it’s about a dead lawyer?
Good Doctor,It'll be good to have a character who can look others in the eye.
Good Doctor,They should’ve casted that redhead girl who played the recurring autistic elite lawyer in the good wife. Her character was so fun.
Good Doctor,I really liked the first season of Nancy Drew. And then.... And then... And then it went off the rails :(
Good Doctor,This isn’t Attorney Woo is it?
Good Doctor,"Felicity Huffman.

okay!"
Good Doctor,"So reading the article…this isn’t a spin-off? 

It’s just a backdoor pilot that they’re hoping gets made into a spin-off? Am I reading that right?"
Good Doctor,"I actually thought season 2 of ND was stronger than its first season. I LOVED season 2 a lot. It's the season that I've recommended to my friends to watch and it has one of my favourite plot twist reveals for television.

Season 3, on the other hand, was a massive step down for me."
Good Doctor,"I think it’s the rare example of a CW show that has maintained a decent quality throughout. Each season has had its ups and downs, but they’ve all been pretty solid. Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but above average. 

I have no interest in whatever this new role for her is."
Good Doctor,"I don’t think it went off the rails.

It just got seriously off-track with the Aglaeca subplot, then course corrected."
Good Doctor,I can't remember how many back door pilots I've seen but it's pretty high and they all seemed to have failed bar a couple exceptions
Good Doctor,"Early part of season 4, I was done. Menendez dying, Sean getting together with Lea and Sean's freakout in Season 2 episode 10. Also by Season 4 I didn't like Sean anymore and thought he was a horrible Doctor that should have stayed in research. 

These were all major events that made me start to dislike the show and by Season 4 I was out."
Good Doctor,Does he ever become a good Doctor?
Good Doctor,It’s basically inspiration porn. Cause in real life no way in hell would someone with Sean’s level of autism be a doctor let alone perform surgery on someone
Good Doctor,"season 4 was the end for me. they changed something and it wasn't the same. 

also, it was a Korean show before"
Good Doctor,"I dropped it after season 3 finale. This past holiday, at the hotel, the TV wouldn't connect to my laptop, so while browsing the channels, I caught the beginning of the earthquake episode. I realized it was the two-parter season 3 finale, so I watched all of it because it was very good, except for Melendez death. 

After it ended I looked up what happened the following seasons. I'm glad I dropped it."
Good Doctor,"Bad acting? May I ask who? I hate when people say bad acting, when the actor is doing what is written, & being directed. To put the blame on the acting, when you don't know what is happening in production is wrong."
Good Doctor,"You are aware that high-functioning autism is a thing, right, and he also had the luck-as-in-universe-reason to have a special interest he was good at so he could put in the focus"
Good Doctor,">San Jose St. Bonaventure may be in need of a new president soon.

>According to Puck News, Good Doctor star Hill Harper is planning to run for U.S. Senate in the state of Michigan, where he will challenge Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin for the seat currently held by outgoing senator Debbie Stabenow. He is expected to announce his candidacy in April.

>A run for political office would likely impact Harper’s future on the Freddie Highmore medical drama, which films in British Columbia, Canada, and is still awaiting word on a Season 7 renewal. TVLine has reached out to ABC and Sony for comment.

>Harper, who plays Dr. Marcus Andrews, is one of three remaining series regulars from The Good Doctor Season 1, including Highmore (who stars as Dr. Shaun Murphy) and Richard Schiff (who plays Shaun’s surrogate father, Dr. Aaron Glassman). A November episode planted the seeds for Andrews to reunite with ex-wife Isobel (now played by Girlfriends‘ Golden Brooks).

>Per Puck, Harper is a lawyer-turned-actor who graduated from Brown University (with Latin honors) and Harvard Law. Prior to The Good Doctor, he starred as Dr. Sheldon Hawkes on the long-running CBS procedural CSI: NY, which ran for nine seasons and ended in 2013."
Good Doctor,He's an intelligent guy but last year he was pushing an altcoin.
Good Doctor,Was hoping he would end up with Lim.
Good Doctor,He plays a great role on a fantastic show. But he would be a magnificent senator. Go for it Hill!
Good Doctor,Getting that Obama endorsement!
Good Doctor,Don't know why you are getting downvoted. The show is fantastic! He will be greatly missed!
Good Doctor,"> But he would be a magnificent senator.

...based on what credentials?  Does he know anything about governing?

Having said that, yes, I realize that many members of Congress don't know squat about governing, so his knowledge, or lack thereof, will probably not mean much.

We need to change the way people are elected.  We certainly wouldn't see a doctor who didn't have a medical license, or hire a lawyer with no license.  And yet we regularly vote for people who know little or nothing about all the facets of holding political office.  This is fking insane."
Good Doctor,"it is by no definition of the word a fantastic show


but the show would be affected by him leaving"
Good Doctor,"[He has more impressive credentials in the public services/policy field than the acting field.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_Harper)  Not just an actor feeling self important and shifting to politics as a new interest, goes back like 30 years to college with him and he's already worked with the White House and NIS on cancer related policy."
Good Doctor,"He has a Harvard law degree and Harvard public policy degree, so not so far fetched."
Good Doctor,"A Democrat that's a Brown University graduate and Harvard Law alum. If he acknowledges climate change, he's got my support."
Good Doctor,Have you spend like a single second looking up his credentials? Like before asking if he knows anything about governing and then in the next breath turn around and said few elected officials knew anything?
Good Doctor,His opponent in the primary is also a Democrat with two Ivy League degrees.
Good Doctor,She voted against the GND. Hard pass.
Good Doctor,The ratings record when Felicity defends a mother who committed a crime to get her son into college.
Good Doctor,"Been looking forward to finding out Kennedy's next move now that Nancy Drew wrapped but LOL, this isn't what I expected.

  
Excited to see where her career goes, though!"
Good Doctor,Waiting for the good cop and good firefighter spin-offs.
Good Doctor,">Living with OCD, Joni has never wanted to be treated differently. While her symptoms take a toll on her personal and professional life, her attention to detail allows her to see cases through a different lens.

Oh, fuck all the way *off.* It's a debilitating mental illness with zero upside, not a quirky way of thinking or a fucking superpower. 

Christ. I'd hoped that Felicity Huffman would get her career back on track, but this really is some cursed-monkey-paw shit right here."
Good Doctor,"after everything, i did miss felicity huffman."
Good Doctor,Felicity out already?
Good Doctor,The ultimate Oxymoron.
Good Doctor,maybe Lori Laughlin can make a guest appearance
Good Doctor,yea good for her. seems a steady gig if show is a hit like precursor
Good Doctor,"Is Nancy Drew officially over? Wish I could have watched more of it, it was quite spooky"
Good Doctor,Kennedy McMann herself has OCD and has stated today that she's excited for true and genuine representation.
Good Doctor,"If TV represented real life, nobody would watch it."
Good Doctor,They just wrapped the final season last month but haven't set a premiere date yet!
Good Doctor,"I have true, genuine OCD and have discussed it before on this site. 

There’s not a lot of upside. I struggle to see the “gift” that my OCD brings to me. 

I remain incredibly skeptical."
Good Doctor,"Yeah, I've seen The Good Doctor's idea of ""true and genuine representation"" of autism. It's basically Lt. Commander Data from Star Trek. If their idea of OCD is anything more than ""Monk, But A Girl"", I'll be pretty damn shocked."
Good Doctor,Is it going to be as ridiculous as The Good Doctor?
Good Doctor,Probably more ridiculous
Death in Paradise,"Always down for more Greg Davies, The Cleaner was interesting, some eps were hits, some misses.

I can’t believe I’m living in a world where we have a Death in Paradise Televisual Universe."
Death in Paradise,I love that we will have “Beyond Paradise. Kris Marshal was my favorite of all the lead investigators.
Death in Paradise,The Cleaner was great. Looking forward to more.
Death in Paradise,"As someone who saw the occasional episode when it was on, Kris Marshall was by far the best. The current guy I just don't enjoy watching"
Death in Paradise,I don't care for him either.  Still enjoy the show though.  Only watch a few of the episodes on Brit Box so far.
Death in Paradise,I enjoyed the early seasons with Ben Miller and Sara Martins the best...kind of lost track after they left
Death in Paradise,"Fuck me. Is this one of the American companies claiming ownership over something they had no development in again?

This is a British and French production.

PBS had no role in the development. This happens a lot with Netflix shows too, to the point where it pisses off the Channel 4 head (he hates Netflix claims of ownership over many Channel 4 shows)"
Death in Paradise,"> 
Fuck me. Is this one of the American companies claiming ownership over something they had no development in again?

No. You're just overreacting to a headline.  No ""American company"" is claiming anything.  An entertainment website is saying a given program is going back into production.

You're clearly taking misguided issue with PBS being mentioned, however PBS' money goes a long way to ensuring this gets made.  

Is it that much different if PBS spends $25 million to buy the produced content, versus spending $25 million on PBS staff to go there and stand around giving notes?  


As well, it's handy for identifying where the show airs.  The two most prominent places it airs on earth are: BBC and PBS.  Their money buying it to air it makes the shorthand appropriate.  

> This happens a lot with Netflix shows too, to the point where it pisses off the Channel 4 head (he hates Netflix claims of ownership over many Channel 4 shows)

He's welcome to reject Netflix's money.  Of course, losing that revenue would probably mean big executive jobs might get cut."
Death in Paradise,PBS isn't claiming anything. They just air it is all.
Death in Paradise,I miss Ben Miller :/
Death in Paradise,"From the article:
>What about crime? How does life in Saint-Marie compare to Guadeloupe? Miller smiles. “Saint-Marie has an incredibly high murder rate, doesn’t it?” He’s right – every week, there’s at least one murder victim to confront DI Poole, often two. That’d make perhaps 70 murders over a year – “and what’s the population of Saint- Marie? Maybe 10,000.”

By contrast, Guadeloupe—the French island where the show is filmed—is much, much safer:
>If you want to get statistical, Trochet’s figures reveal a murder rate of around 8.2 per 100,000 inhabitants. Though this makes Guadeloupe one of the safest islands in the Caribbean – Jamaica has a rate of more than 50 murders per 100,000, according to official figures from the United Nations – its murder rate is roughly on a par with that of Los Angeles; meanwhile, the rate here in the UK is 1.2 murders per 100,000.

>Saint-Marie, on the other hand, has an annualised murder rate of 700 per 100,000 – making it far and away the deadliest place on the planet. This is despite a 100 per cent clear- up rate, courtesy of DI Poole and his three colleagues – and without the use of any 21st-century forensic science."
Death in Paradise,Even worse than midsomer murders?
Death in Paradise,That's just keeping up the tradition of British Crime dramas then. Just look at Midsomer Murders and Bergerac.
Death in Paradise,"We're assuming that episodes take place in real-time, perhaps there's months or years between murders."
Death in Paradise,Like Miami as seen in Dexter.  Serial killer capital of the universe.
Death in Paradise,">This makes the fictional British colony the deadliest place on Earth, 85 times more dangerous than Los Angeles and almost 600 times more dangerous than the UK.

Pfe. Only 35 times higher than Wilmington, Delaware (rate: 2.6/10,000)? 

"
Death in Paradise,You wouldn't think the televisual equivalent of being drowned in a vat of warm custard would be such a bloodbath.
Death in Paradise,"I love this show, thought Ben Miller as the lead was the best but it's still good. Also DCI Banks is the only other similar show I watch and they also have the same type of outrageous murder rate in the fictional city based around the Midlands I think. New Death in Paradise season is coming soon, and I hope they renew DCI Banks."
Death in Paradise,"Same here, I still like watching the show, but Ben made it so much better. "
Death in Paradise,">Jamaica has a rate of more than 50 murders per 100,000, according to official figures from the United Nations – its murder rate is roughly on a par with that of Los Angeles

So LA has appr. 5/10,000 which is only 14 times less (not 85). "
Death in Paradise,"What Midsomer lacks in murder, it makes up for in sexual deviancy."
Death in Paradise,"> So LA has appr. 5/10,000 which is only 14 times less (not 85). 

1/85th Saint-Marie's murder rate, not Jamaica's."
Death in Paradise,"The title claims that _Saint-Marie_ rate is 70/10,000. That's what I am comparing LA rate to. 70/5 = 14, not 85."
Death in Paradise,You are right and I was wrong; thank you for the correction.
Death in Paradise,No problem. 
Death in Paradise,Coupling is really good. Absolutely Fabulous. Black Books.
Death in Paradise,"The Misfits is a great show on Hulu, lots of WTF moments, blood, and comedy."
Death in Paradise,"Black Adder, The Mighty Boosh, A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Spy, The Wrong Mans.

They have a pretty good selection."

Death in Paradise,"Love the library in the first seasons, but nothing beats the magic box."
Death in Paradise,"Creed-“That is northern lights cannabis indigo.”

Dwight-“sigh.  No, it’s marijuana.”"
Death in Paradise,"Absolutely, and the Pork store or Bing offices."
Death in Paradise,Have only seen first and last but the Wire such a good show and the basement definitely had such great scenes.
Death in Paradise,Love it. Absolutely how I felt watching this as a kid too.
Death in Paradise,Glen kills it in the breakroom.
Death in Paradise,"Oh very lucky , everybody in that production is imo. Have you not seen from Season 1. It's *really* good."
Death in Paradise,Hell yeah dude
Death in Paradise,"Don't forget, there was one episode that the guys had to fight for the couch."
Death in Paradise,"Look closely, there's a little ""reserved"" sign on the table in each episode"
Death in Paradise,"It holds up well, so much brilliant wordplay"
Death in Paradise,"Michael: How long does it take you to brush your teeth in the morning?

Billy: I don't know, like 30 seconds?

Michael: Oh my God that's three times as long as it takes me"
Death in Paradise,The episode(s) I watched was actually a two parter. A girl is stabbed on her boat before rounding the bay and then some rich dude has feelings for his estranged daughter. Great craic
Death in Paradise,"I think there was also a joke before the title sequence where they go into the coffee house, see that the couch is taken and then awkwardly just leave."
Death in Paradise,The original Law and Order and E.R. both did this.
Death in Paradise,Charlie's Angels changed out all the cast except Bosley.
Death in Paradise,"Power Rangers lost the last of its original cast by the fifth season, and now has a new cast each season."
Death in Paradise,"In Treatment?

Patients are swapped out each season, after season 2 Paul's psychologist as well as his partner were replaced, and now, in the upcoming 4th season, even Paul himself is gone - leaving no one from the original cast."
Death in Paradise,"Grey's Anatomy has to be getting as much to that point as they can, sans Ellen Pompeo."
Death in Paradise,"Well not the entire cast of Death in Paradise. Don Warrington is still there, and Catherine"
Death in Paradise,Legends of Tomorrow is in the process of doing this
Doraemon,I've been rewatching some dragon ball Z lately and really thought the music was incredible. What a legend.
Doraemon,"Time to gather the Dragon Balls boys

But seriously RIP, his music is so essential to the show and plays a huge role in the emotional investment we all have in the series"
Doraemon,"Sad, I just rewatched dragonball and the music as usual stuck out to me.

Hugely inspiring and a source of constant magic in my childhood, RIP"
Doraemon,"This man is a pioneer, thank you for what you did sir, and Rest In Peace."
Doraemon,"What a sad day.  The man's work was as integral to the iconic works he was a part of as any of the story, characters, designs, or events.  

I can't help but go over an old post of mine fanboying over his work in r/dragonballfighterz a few years back.

____


1. [**Cha La Head Cha La**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnLO7MVKno) - Off to an obvious start.  This song is as iconic to the series as Goku's spiky hair.  A sweeping, toe-tapping, adventurous song with a catchy chorus, impressive range and a sparkly 80's synth intro that got everyone excited and prepped for the world of talking pigs, capsule cars and blonde aliens.

2. [**We Gotta Power**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSOjj8Q_9b4) - Let's get this out of the way as well.  From it's illustrious and majestic intro to it's sharp turn into 80's synths and big choir choruses...we 'gotta' have it.  Also, I would have loved to have seen [We Gotta Power's prologue variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j72ca3NfUkM) as the character select theme but I don't think that's too likely, sadly.  Ahhhh well.  (Also, for everyone wondering, here was [Cha La's prologue variation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVYeJyZCwzE).)

3. Trunks' Themes : [**Break Point Unlimited**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMYt9sGOcTU) (DBZ was all horns sections and strings up to this point, so it was fitting for our futuristic hero to have something futuristic as well.  Well...90's futuristic, anyway), the *very* renowned [**Hikari no Willpower**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjllfs0QyEo) (which speaks for itself), and the hopeful and bright [**Aoi Kaze No Hope**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z00VOo6kdKM) - I wish we could have them all.  Trunks' amazing themes were one of the reasons I loved him so much as a character, and I suspect many others did too.

4. [**Solid State Scouter**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm77VCkf_do) - You may have seen this strange song mentioned here or there from ardent DBZ fans...and there's good reason for it.  Bardock's synthetic (practically Megaman X-esque) battle music is as catchy as it is 80's.  Which (given his son's 90's dominating series) is pretty fitting and clever. 

5. **Battle Tracks**: [**This one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu1UWdfX2xY&list=PLmgeYrjlrhbvZtgvWFLPmUaaAM2PUKSTx&index=8) and [**this one**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaG5XiiNuEM&list=PLmgeYrjlrhbvZtgvWFLPmUaaAM2PUKSTx&index=1), specifically - Brilliant horn sections, dynamic arrangements and a flurry of strings that Kikuchi used to bring the battles to life and gave the world of dragon ball the charm and character it has.  Also, [**Chikyuu Marugoto Chou-Kessen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK_AuzE2pgs), a track that is so inherit to the dna of the dragon ball soundscape that it has been in everything, from Dragon Ball to Z and all its sagas and even into the films.  Pure Kikuchi, through and through.

6. [**Piccolo's Theme**](https://youtu.be/C55vYFOEuwA?t=7m5s) - a suitably enigmatic, colourful theme for our favourite enigmatic, colourful alien.  Like Williams' score for Star Wars, Kikcuhi used leitmotifs to transform and stretch themes to suit many different situations and moods; that means one character's melody had many variations - from battle music, to heroic music to sad music.  Piccolo's theme had as much (if not more) variations than most character themes throughout the series and stood out every bit on the soundtrack as he did in the cast.

7. [**Vegeta's Theme**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2JPaSpi7Tg) - one of the most recognizable pieces of the series; regal, prideful and somewhat tragic, just like our tragic prince.  Vegeta's theme fits his character as perfectly as his trademark armour.  That said, it doesn't really make for great battle music.  For that, we turn to the fantastic and must-be-included [**Majin Vegeta Battle theme**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQmsRJzUlk8&list=PLmgeYrjlrhbvZtgvWFLPmUaaAM2PUKSTx&index=10); one of the best battle tracks in the franchise history.  I'd love for one to be the intro for the other; one starting the fight off and the other exploding as the fight takes off.

8. [**We Were Angels**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNhnTCpa-Jo&index=7&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F) - though not as iconic as the series' [famously quirky end credits music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgvK17jGys0&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F&index=6), that one leaned more towards the series' roots in tone and zaniness whereas this track was much more inherit to DBZ and what the new soundtrack was becoming.  Big, bright and optimistic with a great '80's training' vibe to it.  And it had a [TON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ZRIFpMRvk) of [variations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmi-a1WU20s) that made it as central to the series as it's title theme counterpart.

9. **The Incredible Movie Songs**: [**Hero**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7ZeOvfFm9s), [**Dragon Power Mugendai**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBcuHA3fWCo) and [**Kiseki No Big Fight**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthiRid8Mck&index=16&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F) - Fantastic vocal tracks by *Hironobu Kageyama*, who was nicknamed 'Mr. DBZ' since he not only sang most Dragon Ball Z songs but was the most recognizable voice in terms of the music.  I love all three of these tracks, though...let's be honest, they probably won't make the game.  Shame...but fingers crossed anyway :)

10. [**Ginyu Tokusentai**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezrbyf6t9mY) - the theme song for the ~~circus act~~, I mean ~~clown factory~~ ...I mean, *eccentric* few that is the Ginyu Squad; every bit as ridiculous and over-the-top as the crew themselves.  If this isn't in the game, we riot.  (And yes, the singer is doing that with his voice *on purpose*.)

11. [**Unmei no Hi: Tamashi tai Tamashi**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGnL9Lk_4pk&index=21&list=PLD7AC73A96468277F) - Gohan's legendary SSJ2 theme from the Cell Saga ; I don't think it makes for great battle music but that doesn't mean it isn't a great song.  It made that moment feel as impactful and powerful as when his father first turned gold and glowy on Namek years earlier. (Also, I'm pretty sure if I didn't mention it, somebody would jump me in the street. Dbz fans are passionate about this song, to say the least...).

Finally, tracks that won't be in the game (I'm sure) but to help flesh out the feel and sound of the original series, here's a few honourable mentions.  [Goodbye, Son Goku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiGRRougbQ4) was the series' go-to sad music that sounded a bit Morricone-esque which is high praise as far as I'm concerned.  [The End of Buu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyzDkdWgQvc) is a majestic song that feels like just pure relief and apotheosis after a huge and grand battle...which is exactly how/where it was used.  And [Saikai!! Tenka-Ichi Budokai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg63tCkesqg) the bombastic and colourful music of the bombastic and colourful world tournament (listen for Piccolo's theme sneaking in!)

Oh and there's also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cj_9CizolQ4)...but...well, we don't talk about that.  ^^^^......shoopa-shoopie ^^^^shoopa-shoo...

Doraemon,Any chance we can summon shenron with the dragon balls and bring him back?

Doraemon,"Cha la, head cha la!!! Rip!!"
Doraemon,"The spirit bomb theme was just amazing, thank you for my childhood. Rip

Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/sluxDY-_zr4) of my fav theme and scene in dbz"

Doraemon,Cha la
Doraemon,I had a hard time upvoting this. RIP to a legend.
Doraemon,"Cha La Head Cha La is a banger, but the song that will forever be stuck in my head is the lovably corny end theme to Dragon Ball. It’s almost Barry Manilow schmaltzy but so satisfying."

RIP Kikuchi"
Doraemon,A legend for his work both in tokusatsu and anime. RIP King.
Doraemon,Thank you for introducing so many beautiful stories to us. May you Rest In Peace & Harmony ❤️

Doraemon,Rest In Peace.
Doraemon,That's really spooky. I woke up early for an appointment and figured I could watch a few Dragonball episodes before leaving. Didn't see this until I got back home. This hurts more than I thought it would.

Doraemon,"For anybody interested in music heavily inspired by Shunsuke Kikuchi’s work on Dragon Ball, I urge you to check out the Dragonball Wave albums by Maitro! He absolutely nails the sound, style and feel of the DBZ soundtrack."
Doraemon,Most of you haven’t heard this man’s music.

Walking with Dinosaurs,"This series was my shit as a kid, including walking with monsters and sea monsters. I’d love a new take on the franchise"
Walking with Dinosaurs,Amazing Dinoworld on Curiositystream is kinda this
Walking with Dinosaurs,And Walking with Beastd. I would kill my family for a remake with updated science
Walking with Dinosaurs,I read your title too quickly and I thought you were suggesting they should reboot The Walking Dead but with dinosaurs. It was very confusing.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Because the image of Dinosaurs is forever ruined now that we know they had feathers. Anything science related needs to show the dinosaurs correctly and current audiences are not ready for that. Give it 15-20 years.  
Walking with Dinosaurs,"I'd love a new one, especially if they upped the special effects on it. The CG on the original wasn't always that great. If they had a bit of a budget and made it look more real, I'd be all over it."
Walking with Dinosaurs,I assumed that’s what OP meant too. And I want it.
Walking with Dinosaurs,I think that might actually get me watching again.
Walking with Dinosaurs,"I wouldn't say that exactly. I rember reading speculation that they had feathers in the 90's. While there hasn't been any feathered dinosaurs featured in any media I remember, it needs to start at some point. This would be perfect to feature them."
Walking with Dinosaurs,Check out Planet Dinosaur and Prehistoric Park. They're both pretty good.
Walking with Dinosaurs,"So much childhood nostalgia revolving round Prehistoric Park. Just a brilliant show!, Nigel Marvin was so charasmatic!"
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Unfortunately, it seems as if this sort of documentary has fallen out of popularity. A lot of recent Dino-docs have been pretty subpar too. I think the fact of the matter is these sort of documentaries are really expensive to make and the excitement behind the central gimmick had diminished. A lot of the more recent shows in this genre like Planet Dinosaur, which used exclusively CG landscapes, look really cheap because of it."
Walking with Dinosaurs,Fully expecting them to wrap it up so they can incorporate some characters into the other upcoming TWD spin offs and ultimately a grand finale that ties all of them together.
Walking with Dinosaurs,TIL this show went more than 3 seasons
Walking with Dinosaurs,FTWD after season 3 varied from passable at best to utterly appalling
Walking with Dinosaurs,"This franchise is basically a zombie at this point. I keep thinking it's over, then I hear about it continuing to limp on"
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Always nice to hear that a show will end. Not get canceled, but getting the opportunity to wrap things up."
Walking with Dinosaurs,"I still stand by the first three seasons being genuinely great TV, and some of season six too. But I’ll always be sad we didn’t get to see the og vision for the story, and how bad it got. 

(It’s wild too how the pilot is still the highest viewed premiere for a tv series in history in terms of same day viewers)"
Walking with Dinosaurs,I didn’t even realize they made it this far
Walking with Dinosaurs,Name a more flogged dead horse. I’ll wait.
Walking with Dinosaurs,"For me, the show went downhill after Morgan came on.  Before then it wasn't perfect, but was different enough to be interesting.  And season 3 was particularly interesting IMO.  After that, it kind of became The Walking Dead 2.0, and while it did have its moments (John's character was a great addition), it was actually weaker than the main show, which was already getting a bit stale.  I do look forward to seeing how it ends, I just hope it's much better than last season was (my least favorite, easily)."
Walking with Dinosaurs,"this show has been on for EIGHT seasons??  


who has been watching this??"
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Wait, did Madison come back? I stopped watching around the time when they got rid of (what felt like) 60% of the cast, including her. I was a fan when Madison, Travis, Nick, and Alicia were the main focus."
Walking with Dinosaurs,Between this and the main show there's 19 seasons of Walking Dead tv so far. Everyone here is making fun of it but somewhere Robert Kirkman is sitting on a throne of money.
Walking with Dinosaurs,AMC is the opposite of Netflix. Run a show too long
Walking with Dinosaurs,At least it will end with Maddison
Walking with Dinosaurs,Who watched this?
Walking with Dinosaurs,This show is still on?!
Walking with Dinosaurs,But where will we turn to for redundant stories about walking and zombies and 'oh noes humans are the real monsters'?
Walking with Dinosaurs,Getting rid of Kim dickins for the bloke from twd was a travesty and where I checked the f out.
Walking with Dinosaurs,"I'm kind of amazed this show still has an audience.  The first season was so bad I checked out.   Now we have 2 more spin-offs, but is there an audience?"
Walking with Dinosaurs,This actually got 8 seasons. AMC really doesn’t know what to do lol
Walking with Dinosaurs,"This show had no real plot after they switched showrunners, they would just find themselves in a new annoying situation every 8 to 12 episodes."
Walking with Dinosaurs,The show that won’t die
Walking with Dinosaurs,I didnt even realise this was still going??!?!
Walking with Dinosaurs,How does this series stack up to TWD? I liked TWD enough but stopped with Negan’s introduction / the ridiculous fake out with Glen.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Should have ended before Alycia left. Now it’s pointless.
Walking with Dinosaurs,AMC will never kill Walking Dead. What other IP do they even have now?
Walking with Dinosaurs,Totally forgot this existed
Walking with Dinosaurs,About 5 seasons too late.
Walking with Dinosaurs,What? That show has more than one season?
Walking with Dinosaurs,I stopped when they were on that boat.  Bored to tears
Walking with Dinosaurs,That shit ended like episode 3.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Ahh 8 seasons to late I see
Walking with Dinosaurs,This show was still going on? Lol
Walking with Dinosaurs,"The quality of this series has been so up and down - but there have been times it was telling a far more interesting zombie/apocalypse story than TWD was. I stuck with it even through some very questionable storylines but there have been some great parts to it. Glad it’s ending though - I would guess some characters will go to the other projects, and I reckon the finale will be better than TWDs “Next, on the Walking Dead Universe” bullshit"
Walking with Dinosaurs,"But its going to set up another 3 or 4 spin-offs first, right?"
Walking with Dinosaurs,Can’t believe this show has 8 seasons. Walking dead killed all zombie enjoyment for me
Walking with Dinosaurs,About 5 seasons too late for me.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Could anyone tell me if this show contributed any story lore relevant to the walking dead? I stopped watching after crack Johnny deep died and they left the Mexican community. But i do know that morgan appeared
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Ya seen one dead guy with a scary weapon, ya seen ‘em all. 🙄"
Walking with Dinosaurs,I stopped watching when the nuclear missiles were launched! I just lost interest!
Walking with Dinosaurs,"""Fear the Walking Dead’ Ended With Season 2 at my house."
Walking with Dinosaurs,I can’t believe this franchise still exists. I never got into it but I certainly see endless complaints about quality about both shows. Apparently they’re even doing new spin-offs? How far off would I be to dub this Zombie Greys Anatomy?
Walking with Dinosaurs,"I tried to get into this show, but couldn't get through the first season.  I honestly thought it was cancelled after season 1 or 2, so was a surprise to hear it went on for 8.  May need to try again, as I've been hearing good things about the later seasons."
Walking with Dinosaurs,People are watching this show?
Walking with Dinosaurs,Yet another Walking Dead show that lasted WAAAAY too long.
Walking with Dinosaurs,This shit went on for 8 years?? Lol
Walking with Dinosaurs,4 seasons too late holy fucking shit!
Walking with Dinosaurs,8 SEASONS? I didn't even know this show was out.  Is time linear???
Walking with Dinosaurs,"thank you, they ruined Fear the Walking Dead when they rebooted it"
Walking with Dinosaurs,The writing FTWD got so so comically bad.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Season 7 was so bad that i stopped watching. AI would make more sensible script.
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Yay! Happy happy fucking joy!!!

I liked this show, I will admit it. It did a lot of stuff, for better or for worse, that The Walking Dead didn't. The first, second and third seasons established a great tone, set during and directly after the zombie apocalypse, and season 3 in particular was brutally good.

Season 4 came along, as did the current cast of characters and, while the show did become ""Morgan and Friends"" it still had its moments. Loved having the mobile troop carrier as a thing. Zombies in a waterpark. The episode in the hurricane (I always want weather to be a bigger part of these shows, and loved when TWD had one in the snow, but didn't have ""weather is an enemy"" as big).

Season 6, the show finally became mostly consistently good again. Early season 6 was a highlight, as the characters became scattered throughout Virginia's empire. Great that Virginia went full Negan and the show actually decided ""fuck it, let's kill her"".

But then season 7 was a huge disappointment. A nuclear zombie apocalypse should have been so much cooler, instead it felt turgid. Strand being the villain - I can go with that, that's cool, but you can't forgive him for all the shit he did at the end and row off into the sunset singing Kumbaya.

So yes, I'm glad this is ending, and hopefully a decent, conclusive ending. It's certainly been a rollercoaster in quality, and could have been way more. In the end, it just became a gritty TWD clone."
Walking with Dinosaurs,Who is still watching this? Is anyone from the original cast even still on this show? I watched the first two seasons and thought it was painfully mediocre so I checked out. Honestly can’t believe it’s still going.
Walking with Dinosaurs,It went 8 seasons? Do they ever explain what caused the zombie apocalypse?
Walking with Dinosaurs,I’m sure all of their fan will be heartbroken :(
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Holy shit. This is still on the air. 8 seasons? Wow. Serious question: is it any good ? 

I remember watching the beginning and thinking it was such an awesome concept. They never showed twd universe actually collapsing, just Rick waking up like 6 (?) months into it. I was so excited to see it. Then they pretty much glossed over it in the first few episodes of the first season. Then I kinda had hopes that they would be standalone seasons and show different parts of the world during the collapse and how they handled it. That never happened. Then I heard they killed off like the entire family from the beginning. So I just lost interest. As I did with the rest of the twd universe."
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Season one sucked. Season two sucked. Season three was awesome, so they decided to soft reboot it in season four. !?!?!
If the TWD universe ever comes to an end, the “geniuses” behind it should take their talent to Congress where they’ll fit right in."
Walking with Dinosaurs,Holy hell this show got EIGHT seasons????
Walking with Dinosaurs,I can’t believe people so watch this
Walking with Dinosaurs,Can someone explain to me what “Fear the Walking Dead” is.   I haven’t watched anything Walking Dead related since like the second season of the original show and I’m totally out of the loop
Walking with Dinosaurs,Holy crap that show is still going
Walking with Dinosaurs,There were 8 seasons?
Walking with Dinosaurs,8 seasons longer than it should have
Walking with Dinosaurs,"What do you mean, fear ended with season 3. There's nothing after that"
Walking with Dinosaurs,Someone please shoot this franchise in the head.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Do AMC have any shows left? Seems like they are cancelling absolutely everything at the start of 2023. Guess it will just be reruns and the 6 episode Walking Dead spin-off series from here on out until the day the turn out the lights for the final time…which does not look that far away!
Walking with Dinosaurs,Wow. I remember watching the first episode and thinking “nah”.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Is this show worth watching until season 3 then stopping or would it just give you blue balls. Everyone says it goes to shit afterwards and I hated Morgan in the main show so I doubt I would go past it.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Promise??
Walking with Dinosaurs,It lasted 8 seasons? I gave up after Nick died
Walking with Dinosaurs,It’s been on for eight seasons?
Walking with Dinosaurs,Is it a different show from the walking dead
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Fear went to shit when Morgan joined the show. Everything is about him and his dont kill moral bullshit. It’s unbelievable he even got a bigger role than Victor Strand.

Scott Gimple has this midas touch but instead everything he touches turns to shit."
Walking with Dinosaurs,"I checked out after what they did to John.

Last I saw fear had turned into Stephen king's the stand"
Walking with Dinosaurs,Fuck this shit
Walking with Dinosaurs,There are 8 seasons of the crappy offshoot?
Walking with Dinosaurs,Got scuuuurred of The Last of Us coming out
Walking with Dinosaurs,That shit been going for 8 seasons?!
Walking with Dinosaurs,Hope they continue to focus hard on the their Anne Rice stuff instead. Interview with the Vampire was really good.
Walking with Dinosaurs,"Good, stupid ass show"
Walking with Dinosaurs,I enjoyed season one and after that I watched it just because …
Walking with Dinosaurs,It’s been on for eight seasons?
Walking with Dinosaurs,About six seasons too late
Walking with Dinosaurs,These dead have been walking forever.
Walking with Dinosaurs,Legit thought this show already ended a year or two ago
Walking with Dinosaurs,Should have ended when Cliff Curtis or Frank Dillane left.
Walking with Dinosaurs,This is STILL on?!? 🤦‍♂️
Walking with Dinosaurs,Amazed to hear it got more than 2 seasons with how awful season 1 was.
Derek,I haven't thought of that show since 2009
Derek,Are Casey and Derek finally gonna bang in this? Because you could tell there was some weird chemistry there in the show
Derek,I loved this show so much. what a random reunion I never expected.
Derek,"The theme song comes right back to me, though I have no idea how much of the series I watched, or how it ended."
Derek,is this the show where the step siblings obviously wanted to fuck
Derek,Reading the comments glad I wasn’t the only one who picked up on the weird romance vibes the show seemed to be building up. Thought I was misreading things as a kid but nope.
Derek,"I'm still disappointed that the initial spin off series Life With Derek Again didn't get picked up. That one was supposed to be about Derek and Casey both moving back home after college and having to share the basement bedroom together and seemed more geared to the audience of the original show who grew up with it, like the iCarly reboot. 

This one is clearly geared towards kids and seems more in the vein of Girl Meets World as far as reboots go. And the premise being that Derek has a daughter who acts like Casey did and Casey has a son that acts like Derek did... They're trying to recreate the series for a younger generation but truly what made Life with Derek so great (and the only reason why there is still a fan base for it) is all that unresolved sexual tension between Derek and Casey that the actors have admitted they've purposefully fed into. 

Its not gonna be good, but I'm still eager to see Mike and Ash back as Derek and Casey again."
Derek,My childhood was ruined a little when I looked at Jordan Todosey/Lizzie's instagram/links in said Instagram.
Derek,And yet there's still no Community movie
Derek,"Oh, I thought this was about the Ricky Gervais show Derek."
Derek,Disney gonna finally drop the show on Disney +?
Derek,"They finally did it. 

They dated in real life. Weird that Leggatt never had much of a career."
Derek,I heard of the show on Disney Channel but never watched it back in the day. But the social media reactions seem to describe the show as just shipping 2 step siblings?! Wild. https://twitter.com/filmupdates/status/1565351158482292736?s=21&t=XGWDPlkPIBvr4HVRNeF0BQ
Derek,Literally anything will get a movie before Community.
Derek,Those two walked so Cersi and Jaime could ran. I was a preteen watching that show and even I felt that chemistry.
Derek,"Never heard of this, thought it was gonna be that godawful Gervais show."
Derek,thought this was about the good Derek show. what a pain in the cunt.
Derek,I have literally never heard of this show in my 51 year old life.
Derek,Bring back the Zack files
Derek,I remember when there were remake rumors back in like 2012. Jordy Todosey even posted a picture of a script.
Derek,The first life with derek movie is one of the worst films I ever watched. Who asked for a sequel
Derek,"While not as good as *Flash Forward* (with Ben Foster and Jewel Staite!!), *Life With Derek* was pretty clearly the second best Canadian ""tween"" sitcom of this era.

Hopefully Disney+ not only picks up this sequel film, but also picks up the original series for the U.S."
Derek,I am pretty sure I have it on bootleg DVDs somewhere.
Derek,I totally forgot it existed until this post. I actually really liked this show.
Derek,"Okay, was I not crazy as a small child? I always felt like the show was lowkey building up to them getting together because it felt like they had the hots for each other. Didn't know upon reflection because I watched it when I was young."
Derek,It’s hilarious that that’s why the show got canceled. They were dating or hooking up in real life and their on screen chemistry was just creepy and pervy instead of siblinglike
Derek,Pornhub Premium’s first original series
Derek,I'm almost positive this show started the weird Step Sibling fetish. The show def had some weird tensions.
Derek,Oh. It was overwhelming
Derek,It's a beautiful thing to come online and realize that the disney channel show that wasn't like the rest of the disney channel shows at the time made other people think that the relationship between the two leads was weird.
Derek,"Ditto. The only thing is their kids’ ages. It’s certainly not unheard of, but going by a rough accounting of the actors’ ages, their characters would’ve had their first kids in their very early 20s (like 21-23). I guess they could age up the characters but in this day and age you don’t see too many young 20something purposely starting families at that age (for Derek I can believe it was unplanned though)."
Derek,"For real. I honestly can not think of single thing that ever happened in this show, the premise, plot lines, whatever. But I still regularly get the theme song stuck in my head."
Derek,"Apparently, yes."
Derek,Why?
Derek,We can only hope that the Community movie references the Life With Derek movie.
Derek,Six seasons and a movie!
Derek,"I watched it for the first time recently.

When it was released about ten years ago it had loads of bad press on the portrayal of disabled people so I didn't watch.

I found the whole thing to be heartwarming and kind. David Earl is worth the entry fee alone. Should've given in a chance first time around really."
Derek,Thats what I was thinking too. Then I see the thumbnail and was like who are these people?
Derek,That show was so bad. Gervais really lost his way.
Derek,What about Radio Free Roscoe?
Derek,Yay someone remembers flash forward!
Derek,I hope the first is degrassi
Derek,Look at comments on the Twitter post lol. They all want DASEY
Derek,"They apparently secretly dated during filming too, so I think that added to the on screen chemistry"
Derek,"Damn I'd pay to see that. There's already tons of step porn, time to grab it from the roots"
Derek,"It wasn’t even just their chemistry, the script was flat out weird. 

There was a point where they’re like “we’re siblings!” And then one is like “step siblings…” and they smirk at each other. The vibes were bizarre."
Derek,[deleted]
Derek,"Michael Seeter is super gay, according to my sister who knows him through the Toronto gay scene. I don't think they ever actually got together or anything."
Derek,Didn’t this show get like 6 seasons? I think it just ran its course.
Derek,Clueless came out first and I’d say the incestuous overtones of that movie are way less subtle.
Derek,"I mean, it’s not uncommon.  Both of my parents were 21 when they had me."
Derek,Seeing someone I watched on TV growing up as a kid in spicy photos / OF haha.
Derek,I'm guessing you are not Canadian.
Derek,I love Radio Free Roscoe so damn much.
Derek,"I remember Flash Forward! I was super young but wasn’t there an episode where they go camping and eat ketchup on hot dog buns lol? 

I also remember a show called “In a Heartbeat” on Disney Channel that was about teenage EMTs. I remember it actually being a pretty solid show."
Derek,The first sentence tells you what the first is.
Derek,"[the scene of  discussion.](https://youtu.be/Q5qQI4G0nTY?t=400)

i honestly think the issue was more of how it was acted. i think it could have been a different vibe if derek didnt look at her like he was in love with her.

&#x200B;

anyway, while im very against incest, i dont think it counts here because they werent raised together - they were both like 16/17 when their parents got together. you put two hormonal teenagers of the opposite sex in the same house, feelings are bound to develop."
Derek,Hollywood has a weird history with sibling relationships on screen. I’m still confused why Monica would so often sit on Ross’s lap on Friends
Derek,"They always seemed like ""fuck each other's spouses"" kind of step siblings anyway."
Derek,Wikipedia just says he's queer. He could be bisexual or pansexual
Derek,"They get all the hot gals!

He might have come out in his 20s."
Derek,I heard he wasn't always practicing and finally felt comfortable enough to come out well after the show was over
Derek,You know what.. that's true.. hard core sibling vibes
Derek,"She lost her virginity to her 22 year old stepbrother. That's weird. She was 17 tops. In California, that's statutory rape."
Derek,Depends on the time. I think it would be less common in the ‘10s and what not
Derek,"Sadly no, I'm the neighbor south of y'all though."
Derek,Oh my gosh I thought I imagined In a Heartbeat. That show was great!
Derek,"I remember loving the Flash Forward theme song!
I remember In A Heartbeat. It definitely was a thing."
Derek,"I don’t know. Things like that, I’d jot down to just a weird close connection with your brother. Sometimes I go out to places and find that some siblings just don’t believe in personal space, or that threshold is very small."
Derek,He calls himself gay in interviews I thought?
Derek,"Oh you know what? Upon revisit they clearly state He’s her “Ex-Stepbrother”, which completely nullifies any potential weirdness. Good ol’ 90’s screenwriters, always thinkin’ ahead.  /s"
Derek,Yep! Loved that show on Disney. Shawn Ashmore was the lead IRRC.

Derek,"Sweets on Bones laid me out. It was SO unexpected, and it makes me cry every time I rewatch."
Derek,"Nate on six feet under,  still gets me today"
Derek,Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street. Watching the adults try and explain to Big Bird why his friend is gone and not ever coming back is so terribly sad
Derek,Mark Greene in ER. My eyes were swollen for two days.
Derek,"Where’s Wallace, String? Huh? Where’s Wallace!? String!!"
Derek,Charlie Pace - LOST
Derek,Mark Greene from er
Derek,"Buffy’s mom in Buffy The Vampire Slayer, her reaction to her mom dying felt really similar to my own, it was a really poignant episode."
Derek,Howard Hamlin got me good
Derek,Seymour - Futurama
Derek,"Omar Little from the Wire (HBO). 

Arguably the most morally straight character despite being a violent criminal and his demise is very unexpected."
Derek,Brendan Frasier in Scrubs
Derek,Opie Sons of Anarchy
Derek,"Mine was Supernatural when sam died

or when Dean died

or when sam died again

or when dean died again

or when cass died

or when cass died again

eventually I just accepted death was only temporary if you have plot armor lol"
Derek,"Mrs Landingham on The West Wing

Mark Greene and Lucy Knight on ER"
Derek,"Rita in Dexter was a really shocking one for me.

Also a bit of a deep cut since it's a cancelled show that didn't do well, but the dad in Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist hit me hard since I lost my own dad many years ago."
Derek,Colonel Henry Blake.
Derek,"John Ritters character on 8 simple rules. He dies in real life then he dies in the episode.
Henry Blake in Mash. When Radar goes in and reads the telegram at the end."
Derek,Hank on Breaking Bad. You know it's coming but Walt not realizing it's over makes you think he's gonna somehow save him. Then Hank just tells it like it is.
Derek,Lucy Knight on ER.
Derek,Mike from Breaking Bad
Derek,Game of Thrones Season 1 episode 9. Still crushes me today. Ned Stark.
Derek,Shireen Baratheon
Derek,"Bill McNeil



HM to Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz. RIP Phil"
Derek,Leo McGarry
Derek,I’m on Season 3 of The Wire. Guess I shouldn’t have opened this thread!
Derek,"Amber in House M.D. 

Absolutely crushed for Wilson when it's finally revealed."
Total Drama,This is why they cancelled the fan series. I wonder who came up with the idea first?
Total Drama,What a weird fucking show. Remember when the climax of one of the episodes was a girl getting her top ripped off during a challenge and they censored her boobs? Wasn't that a cartoon network show? What a weird inclusion
Total Drama,HBO Max is going all out on adult animation and I love it. I might be the only one but after seeing Clone High get 2 seasons straight to series I’m hoping some HBO executive digs up the corpse of *Mission Hill* and reanimates it. One half season on the WB was so unjust for that show.
Total Drama,"Well I, for one, am very happy!"
Total Drama,Sha lightning better be back
Total Drama,If they don’t bring back Owen then I’m out.
Total Drama,I really hope they include some of the total drama ridoncolous race characters into one of the seasons on  the show
Total Drama,totally dramatic
Total Drama,I love this series and I’m happy it’s coming back. It’s stupid as hell but that’s kinda the whole point. Very iconic characters have been birthed from this show too lol
Total Drama,Does this mean that Chris McLean will finally step away from controlling world events? But for real though the last few years have felt like they were being run by that guy
Total Drama,"They need to do what they should have done from season 2 and keep the same format but with a new cast. I lost interest in the show when they started to include musical numbers and fantasy elements, in its first few episodes it was a surprisingly strong satire of 2000s reality shows"
Total Drama,Please bring back 6teen too. I loved Jude growing up.
Total Drama,"I'm sure this is something many other people here have already experienced, but as someone approaching 30, it's interesting to watch the nostalgia/reboot machine shift its targets to a generation younger than me. Obviously 80s and 90s nostalgia has dominated pop culture for the last decade or more, but with revivals like this, iCarly, that Spongebob video game remake, etc, it's kind of cool to be on the outside looking as fanbases that are largely 5-10 years younger than me are now revisiting their childhood shows. Soon the sunset squad robots will come to put my old ass out to pasture."
Total Drama,That could be fun.
Total Drama,I never got the appeal to the show it seems like every other bad Canadian animated show and I would know I grew up on those.
Total Drama,"I have fond memories of this show, is it worth rewatching as an adult?"
Total Drama,I am so hyped. Please please please make unkilly sadistic Chris from S1-3 not the blood thirsty Chris from S4-6.
Total Drama,Here is hoping they bring back Venture Bros.
Total Drama,Still no news on the Venture Bros
Total Drama,Cartoon Network has had ratings issues for years and most of their popular long running shows ended in the last year or so. My best guess is this revival is less because they just don't have much else to fill that void.
Total Drama,"You’re literally beating a dead horse bc you can’t make any good shows , that being sis Craig of the creek along with some other is amazing"
Total Drama,TIL Cartoon Network still exists
Total Drama,[deleted]
Total Drama,if cody doesnt return im gonna cry
Total Drama,"No TDI without Duncan though, please"
Total Drama,Total Drama Pandemic
Total Drama,"Fun fact, the guy who voices the host (Chris McLean) was in an episode of Degrassi where Jimmy (Drake) tries to buy condoms. 

It's stupid, but I just think about it sometimes."
Total Drama,Will those seasons be in Canada too?
Total Drama,"I'm mostly wary of what they plan to do to the characters. Are we getting a new cast? Or are they bringing back old fan favorites? I kinda hope they bring back characters who were shorted on character development like Eva, or Tyler. Maybe even characters like Anne Maria who never got to have a proper storyline, or characters like Lewshawna whose story wasn't resolved as she was nearly written out."
Total Drama,[deleted]
Total Drama,Do you think they'll bring The Ridonculous Race back
Total Drama,Does anyone know of the original seasons will be on hbomax also or will just be able to watch on total drama youtube channel that has all the episodes
Total Drama,does anyone knows if ridonculos race is coming back for a second season? or if the goths ( crimsom amd annui ) are coming back for any season?
Total Drama,no total drama without duncan
Total Drama,I am so excited!
Total Drama,Is it coming out or already out I have no idea
Total Drama,That’s epic
Total Drama,"They've apparently been working on these new seasons for about a year now. Back in 2018, Tom McGillis said in an AMA that there was no market for the series to continue. Something must have changed his mind between 2018 and 2020."
Total Drama,"How long was that after The Amazing Race parody?  That's when I finally lost interest.  Watched briefly the day care tv show, I think the writers after a while ran out of good ideas."
Total Drama,That's what I thought too.
Total Drama,[removed]
Total Drama,"Cartoon Network didn’t make it. They just broadcasted it for the US. Teletoon made it which is a Canadian animation company. And Canada is less strict with teen level programming and have censored swearing and boobs in a good number of shows I have seen from them. 

But I agree it is weird that Cartoon Network decided to pick it up to broadcast in the US."
Total Drama,"No censorship this time. Heard they're gonna show everything, even full penetration."
Total Drama,It’s a parody of Survivor and that scene is also a reference to something that happened in survivor lol.
Total Drama,I remember my horny young self jackin off endlessly to that lol
Total Drama,"You Mean Heather?,"
Total Drama,In Canada this was a children's show. Was it marketed for adults in the US?
Total Drama,Sad man
Total Drama,"He fucking better be, Lightning got screwed in s5. I also kinda want Cody back"
Total Drama,i heard it's a all new cast
Total Drama,Cry
Total Drama,bruhh im tired of owen ngl
Total Drama,[removed]
Total Drama,"In the image attached to the announcement, you can see some silhouettes of old characters from the show (Owen, Beth, Lindsay, heather, Alejandro, Harold, Lightning) and included are the guy from the Daters and the Goths, so its definitely possible."
Total Drama,I mean... sometimes thinking gets old
Total Drama,"Your opinion is so wrong it hurts, when the best seasons of the show featured the old cast I think that invalidates your awful idea"
Total Drama,That one was the hollywood season right?
Total Drama,What is there to come back? It was just a reflection of reality.
Total Drama,Just wait until shows that come out 10 years from now get rebooted in your late 50s and everyone is nostalgic for the early 2030s
Total Drama,"Well, the appeal is easy to understand.  Total drama is based on archetypes which most children can find themselves in, you mostly have the classic archetypes like the nerd and the jock.  However what sets total drama apart is that in every episode one contestant gets voted home so people will stay hooked because they want to see their favorite character make it far."
Total Drama,why are you here?
Total Drama,I thought it was entertaining enough as some who watched it after the fact
Total Drama,What day will it be back
Total Drama,Yup
Total Drama,"CN doesn’t air many of their good shows, but they do have a lot of good shows. They air what makes them money, but still make good shows so cartoon youtubers can advertise for them so people check the channel frequently to see if they favourite show is on."
Total Drama,"You got downvoted by 8 year olds, whose favorite show is teen titans go."
Total Drama,My kid is literally watching tv as I read your comment.
Total Drama,"Chris McLean’s actor also voiced for a show called ‘Inanimate Insanity’. Only for one episode, because when the second episode was out of come out he left the ‘Toon Club’. It’s basically just TDI but with objects instead of humans and also a plot involving a Steve jobs guy ‘Steve Cobs’ being Chris McLean and literally torturing IPhones."
Total Drama,It’s gonna suck
Total Drama,Probs not.
Total Drama,Goths are in the new season
Total Drama,the show got a huge resurgence in popularity from the tiktok and stan twitter crowds. dude probably saw that and decided to come back.
Total Drama,Maybe having it on HBO Max influenced their decision. I know it's also on Cartoon Network but HBO Max being a platform for the show seems like it could be a reason they changed their mind. Maybe being added to CN was a secondary decision after the HBO Max deal was made.
Total Drama,"there was a massive petition, that I even signed, that reached goal last year to get the show renewed for Netflix. Perhaps they listened to the fans for once and actually did it. Hopefully it's entertaining and hopefully Duncan comes back 🤞"
Total Drama,">Something must have changed his mind between 2018 and 2020.

$$$"
Total Drama,"It was a fan series on  YouTube that had like one episode. It was basically about the original cast all getting back together, after years and years of them becoming full-fledged adults."
Total Drama,"apparently cartoon network has a lot more control over the series than thought. they're the ones who cancelled it originally and decided to do the daycare spinoff. then again they're also the ones bringing it back so

and I don't blame em for ending it originally, all stars and pahiktew sucked"
Total Drama,"But CN made The Amazing World of Gumball, which is for kids, and I saw more censored dicks there than in all the hentai I watched."
Total Drama,I honestly thought it was supposed to be an adult swim show you can see script differences that they made for the Cartoon Network run when you watch on Netflix with subtitles
Total Drama,"> But I agree it is weird that Cartoon Network decided to pick it up to broadcast in the US.

During the mid 2000's Cartoon Network imported a shitload of Canadian shows like Total Drama Island or Johnny Test. The Canadian government mandates that a percentage (10% I think?) of all programming on their channels needs to be Canadian in origin, and they also subsidize Canadian productions to ensure that there's enough Canadian content to meet that standard.

So these shows already exist, and Cartoon Network can just license them for cheap to air in the US instead of having to pay to have them made. Ultimately, the Canadian government ended up paying for these shows to be broadcast on Cartoon Network- this isn't a terrible thing as it's a way of promoting Canadian culture abroad and exercising ""soft power"", and the US does this with its blockbuster movies all the time."
Total Drama,"And then he smells crime again, he's out busting heads. Then he's back to the lab for some more full penetration. Smells crime. Back to the lab, full penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Full penetration. Crime. Penetration. And this goes on and on and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just sort of ends."
Total Drama,Can’t wait for Owen’s sex scene
Total Drama,"Man, Chris gonna fuck another plant?"
Total Drama,Bruhhhh 😂
Total Drama,"Other way around, and replace adult with teen. US was Pre-teen. It’s like watching a marvel movie as a kid, nothing that’ll harm you but to say it’s the most appropriate thing to watch is not true. The age group difference is only a tiny bit noticeable, as it was more of just censorship."
Total Drama,fuck
Total Drama,Yep.  Disappointment.
Total Drama,"I agree I thought it was great show, I was hoping they would continue it"
Total Drama,WHAT ABOUT BRIGETTE OR JEFF😭😭
Total Drama,My issue wasn’t with the cast but with the musical numbers which felt wedged into a supposedly competitive series. The seasons following that delved even further into fantasy elements I didn’t care for. What I’m saying is it would be nice to see the show return to having a similar vibe as it did in season 1.
Total Drama,"Yeah I know the premise of the show but I found whenever I watched it as a kid it was the same as any other kids show. Lazy animation, crude humour, ok voice actin... I just really don’t see the appeal to the show."
Total Drama,"I'm a teen, and I like Teen Titans Go."
Total Drama,Yo infinity train is still going and it's VERY graphic.
Total Drama,Feels weird to see an II reference in the wild
Total Drama,That somehow doesn't surprise me. Same thing happened for Legend of Korra I think. Tumblr resurrected it.
Total Drama,Same thing happened with Clone High which was also announced along side TDI. Don’t know how it happened but one day social media was full on Clone High memes and next thing you know they’re announcing it’s revival.
Total Drama,Well did he greenlighy the season itself
Total Drama,it's on Netflix too
Total Drama,New characters maybe the old ones will make a cameo hopefully
Total Drama,I hope Owen and Izzy get together.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Not surprised at all to learn that How to Train Your Dragon and Jurassic Park were both reference points for the Storm's End and dragon fight sequences. The stormy glimpse of Vhagar when Lucerys arrives at the castle was very T-Rex-y, and in general I got a similar sense of impending doom during that scene.

The aerial chase scene between the two dragons was also really well done, and the sense of scale was crazy with Vhagar dwarfing Arrax."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Smart move because the dragon fight and flight scenes in those movies are gorgeous.

>Yaitanes also said that he ended up changing the dragon fight sequence after noticing similarities to ""How to Train Your Dragon.""

Damn, to think we were this close to Luke surviving with his leg torn off."

DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"How to train your dragon was and is an amazing film completely overshadowed by Avatar, which was still in theaters at the same time. Avatar, for all its achievements, wasn’t even the best film in theaters with a guy riding a dragon."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,I dunno if I'd call it a fight so much as a snack
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Vhagar’s aerial shadow over Arrax reminded me of an outline of a great white underneath a boat before it attacks, I literally jumped. They did a great job with the entire fight scene."

 two cats fighting?  A drunk guy at a music festival trying to put his flip flops on?"

DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,How to Train your Dragon is probably the best movie to involve dragons.  No need to try to make anything better.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"I just want to say in this thread everybody should go watch the show Quarry which he directed all 8 episodes of, got left on Cinemax to die but the season is phenomenal and the finale is one of the best directed episodes in tv history. If that show was on parent network HBO he easily wins his 2nd outstanding directing emmy. True detective s1 ep4 level with a masterful 7m long take and then a cut and 4m more to follow. It’s so fuckin good. The show deserved so much better and would’ve been a hit on other streamers especially hbo, really sad situation especially because there was tons of source material to pull from for future seasons. Cannot recommend the show enough it deserves to be seen great cast/acting/directing/cinematography. Here is the trailer for anyone interested https://youtu.be/loJxKTCkoTY"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"I’ve never seen httyd, but I assumed that lucerys and his dragon were partially based on that movie. He’s a dead ringer for the animated character. His dragon is small too. All the proportions are there."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"I can imagine Ben Wyatt energy: ""I watched ‘Enchanted’ three times to get all the details right, and then another two times because that movie is amazing."" lol"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"""Fight"""
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,This is so hilarious it makes it somehow awesome
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"And HTTYD actually collaborated with experts for advise on the ""technical aspects of bird flight"" when animating the film. My wife got her masters under a professor who is listed in the end credits of the movie and was part of that collaboration."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,There's a new Game of Thrones series?
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Why didn't they use that science-based dragon MMO? It seems perfect for this.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,So they used a dragon training guide to...train their dragons?
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Worked on a game that had dragons in it. Animators tried to reference bats for the dragon flight animations cuz…they have leathery bat wings. It looked terrible of course. I told them to model it after the Game of Thrones dragons instead. How to Train Your Dragon would have been good too, maybe even better."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,They must have been watching Shrek as well.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"nice title bro, love how it spoils it"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,No duh. Plus httyd is far better than hotd.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"I don't plan to watch this show, but I want to comment on the final fight at the end of How to Train your Dragon.  That fight was a culmination of everything both Toothless and Hiccup had learned together over the course of training in the movie and the trust and friendship they built.  And from a tactical standpoint Hiccup knew this massive dragon's greatest threat was gravity.

If you don't build all that type of stuff in the show and hope for a good battle, it's just going to fall flat."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Bran king already?
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Great spoiler
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Spoiler. Damn. Have not finished the season. I hate entertainment news.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Spoilers in the title, why would you do this?"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Hello? Spoiler Alert!
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,BRO THANKS FOR THE SPOILER
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Seems about right for the dumpster fire of a show.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Spoiler title
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,We all immediately knew. It was practically shot by shot
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Lmao woooooow so it looked like that scene on purpose
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Watching documentary to make another documentary, makes sense."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"God, the dragon action and animation was so good in this show. I’m happy to see the director took inspiration from the HTTYD franchise for bits of it. And the way they went out, too- an accidental death at the hands of a cousin, who’s now a Kinslayer who lit the powder keg for a civil war with their family at the heart of it. 

Plus the size and colour scheme of Lucerys’ dragon kind of reminds me of my favourite Pokemon (Salamence, with its blue body and red wings), which *really* just twisted the knife that much more. Their death scene never fails to make me sad, yet I’ve rewatched that scene more than any other for this season."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Ahh yes, season finale spoilers in the title. Nice"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"House of Dragon was sooo predictable and boring. It felt like hbo gave the writer’s room a list of things that made the og game of thrones a hit. Incest, check!  Dragons, check!  Cheesy court intrigue soap opera, check. Torture and gratuitous gore or torture - check. But they forgot about humor, world building and any sense of cohesiveness. Compared to Andor or Rings of Power, House of Dragons felt like a B movie."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Spoilers in the title. Good job
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Fucking SPOILER.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Love it when there are spoilers in the title. 

What the fuck?"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Spoiler literally in the title, assholes"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Thanks for the spoilers you massive dickhead
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,/r/nottheonion
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"no wonder it was the most obvious shit ever, it was crafted for small children"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Neat
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"On the behind the scenes part of the episode 10, you can clearly see how to train your dragon on in the background"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,I recommend reading Zog for further dragon-research.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"I know this is meant to be a good thing, primarily because I’ve seen the HoD episode and the dragon fight is great. But the headline does kind of remind me of the writers in [this sketch.](https://youtu.be/4k9_N4k5IQI)"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,I was litteraly expecting for Luke to do that maneuvar from the firts movie
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Disney+ should at this point make a HTTYD live action film. Just a thought
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,ofcourse he did i was thinking of this the moment i watched it and anyway it would be great if some does a live action movie like how to train dragon
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Good idea. It's a great series
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Makes sense
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Aemond should have probably done the same.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,We managed to save you…. Well most of you
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Strong move
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"How To Train Your Dragon was effortless in how good it was, so it's no wonder why this was something to view before doing it."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,One of the few trilogies where each film is a masterclass of storytelling and visuals.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"~~Plagiarize from the best~~

I mean pay *tribute*"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,HtTYD did that shit great. Absolutely use it as a reference.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Learn from the best.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"I just rewatched the first How To Train Your Dragon the other night. It really holds up, basically flawless, no wasted scenes. I enjoyed the sequels too, but the original is the one that stands out in my mind."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,House of how to train your magical dragon of thrones of the ring you’re a lizard Harry.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Reign of Fire is also a good one
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,How to train your director
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,So will there be a Night Fury?
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"This is a man of Quality, resolve, and unmatched charisma."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Tell me he finished the series
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"How the fuck did Daemon find out about the chomp so fast? 

Did part of the body fall on his lap or something?"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,That’s a good movie
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Just a theory, but I'll spoiler mark it since it relates to the end of episode.  >!Anyone think the prince could survive clinging to the netting we see on Vhagar's neck.  Since we don't see a body.!<"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Wasn't much of a fight to be honest. More like a horror thriller monster out to get you vibe.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"After watching the scene , my wife said it reminded her of “How to Train Your Dragon”."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,I don’t think THAT happened in How to Train Your Dragon 🥴
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Spoiler title
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"both movies failed to the fact that it's impossible to do it without protecting your eyes, director should have seen Avatar, it is dumb to think dragon riders can see shit with naked eyes, pretty big error"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,That’s actually pretty smart
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"It's easy to forget that Roger Deakins worked very closely with the cinematographer on the HTTYD movies. ('Easy to forget' because he's only listed as ""Visual Consultant"". I suspect due to guild/union/studio rules? Even on Rango he's listed as ""cinematography consultant"")  
  
If you're gonna 'take inspiration', take it from one of the Greats."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Finally, HTTYD getting its due!!"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Yes this 1000% should be at the top of my new page.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,But why did he attack vhagar? Just run and hide little one. You were almost free…
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,I could see it with the broadside the little dragon did on the bigger one. Had some how to train your dragon vibes for sure.
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Well, I guess now I know the finale has a dragon fight, despite me not having started watching the show, yet.

Thanks, spoiler titles!"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Toothless!
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"The flight scene reminded me off hiccup being above the clouds for the first time, but when he was flying during the storm it was totally like when the big queen and toothless were fighting."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,[deleted]
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"T-rex vibes and also GODZILLA for me!  It was terrifying seeing Vhagar off in the distance upon arrival.  I said, ""Oh shit...""."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"The sense of scale was so well done i said "" OH MY GOD"" out loud and had to replay the reveal for my kid who absolutely had to know what I was reacting to. She said ""woah"" or something. 10/10 would watch this part again ."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Also Shrek for the coronation scene
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"Fun fact, much like the way the Trex wasn’t supposed to bring down the glass roof of the SUV scaring the kids for real, Meraxes wasn’t supposed to eat Lucerys and Aemond’s Reaction is genuine"
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,"When the big bastard comes up through the clouds, its a holy shit, he dead, moment."
DreamWorks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,Looked like that was a kid pretending to be 12 while riding a pony at the fair.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Never really thought it was in question. I don't know if the spinoffs can sustain themselves, but the main show will last as long as RuPaul does."
RuPauls Drag Race,Drag Marathon
RuPauls Drag Race,cross-*dress* 200 eps…
RuPauls Drag Race,Good on Rupaul passing his rival Milton Berle as TV's top transvestite
RuPauls Drag Race,The Spanish version is some of the best of the whole show. The judging panel are so good without trying to just imitate the original
RuPauls Drag Race,canada is already scrapping the bottom of the barrel this season. the international versions will definitely not be able to have the same longevity

RuPauls Drag Race,Presumably with a ridiculousness lead in & followed by ridiculousness.
RuPauls Drag Race,"I am excited by this, not because I think it's a great thing for Drag Race, or because I think MTV is long for this world as a cable network (or that cable itself is going to be a thing for much longer either)

But because this means The Challenge can now start mining Drag Race cast for contestants and holy SHIT do I need this collision of worlds as badly as possible."
RuPauls Drag Race,MTV is owned by Paramount. Sounds like just an internal shuffle.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Logo to VH1 to Paramount to MTV.

Girl. Lay down some roots."
RuPauls Drag Race,They all belong to the same parent company. All this does is increase accessibility and shuffle traffic and advertisers.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Considering how many emmys it has won, how the hell are they on like yearly contracts at this point. I swear if Hbo Max didnt have the worst new chairman right now they would buy it up and get tons of new subscribers"
RuPauls Drag Race,"Remember when MTV was about music?

Pepperidge Farms doesn't either."
RuPauls Drag Race,How will this impact ridiculousness re runs?
RuPauls Drag Race,"Literally, how do I watch this show without going to the gay bar? Now that I've missed the first episodes, I'm already behind. I shouldn't need cable to access it or pay a ridiculous amount per month."
RuPauls Drag Race,*Chanel West Coast Laughing ensues*
RuPauls Drag Race,"Hey now, sometimes we get a new episode of The Challenge!"
RuPauls Drag Race,Maybe a drag version of ridiculousness?
RuPauls Drag Race,Imagine the scenes if some rookie from Drag Race eliminates Fessy in a Hall Brawl or Pole Wrestling match. It would be glorious.
RuPauls Drag Race,Paramount is for the spinoff not the main show.
RuPauls Drag Race,Because emmys dont make money and nobody is watching this show
RuPauls Drag Race,"Not to come at you or anything, but do you even know what Drag Race is? It's like at least 45% music lol it's closer to being related to music than most of their programming for the past 20 years."
RuPauls Drag Race,This! It’s absolutely ridiculous that I have to now get live cable streaming for $70 a month just to enjoy the show. The amount of switching and paying for other streaming services is to much. Just put the show on Paramount+!
RuPauls Drag Race,Eh huh huh huh huh
RuPauls Drag Race,My reality tv fandom exists squarely in this intersection
RuPauls Drag Race,I would love to watch that!!!
RuPauls Drag Race,"People are watching it, but no shows get renewed for more than 2 seasons at a time anymore."
RuPauls Drag Race,If you can call that music………nvm you mean probably mean the lip sync and not pauls ”music”
RuPauls Drag Race,"FYI, I found it on Amazon Prime for purchase! It's only like $15-$20 for the whole season! Untucked is a separate charge, but still better than paying for a cable streaming subscription."
RuPauls Drag Race,music is music. it doesn’t have to cater specifically to to you. and miss paul has some bangers
RuPauls Drag Race,"Taika is on a roll, baby"
RuPauls Drag Race,Twoooooo Minogues?
RuPauls Drag Race,The season is premiering in a week so it’s weird they’re announcing like the judges haven’t already filmed it
RuPauls Drag Race,How exciting!! Season starts may 1st can’t wait to watch
RuPauls Drag Race,"Taika Waititi doesn't need to do this, the Minogues will take any publicity they can get because they're pathetic but Taika is above this crap."
RuPauls Drag Race,[deleted]
RuPauls Drag Race,"Considering Kylie Minogue - the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time - has just had another number one album, I don't think she needs the publicity. She has a successful 30-year pop career under her belt. Dannii, on the other hand, could do with the exposure."
RuPauls Drag Race,"Absolute nonsense. Anyone who’s anyone has judged on Drag Race. Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Jeff Goldblum, Miley Cyrus. And Kylie is incredibly famous and successful. She doesn’t ‘need’ to do anything, the people that judge on this show absolutely love it."
RuPauls Drag Race,Literal Oscar winners like Taika have guest judged. Even an EGOT one.
RuPauls Drag Race,They're guest hosting a TV show not signing onto a mortgage. You're probably taking this more seriously than any of them.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Hey

Hey

Danni is a treasure and has been since young talent time"
RuPauls Drag Race,Plus maybe they actually want to be on the show?
RuPauls Drag Race,"I only catch Graham’s shows clips when they’re shared on here, but that talk show has the best, most genuine interactions with their guests."
RuPauls Drag Race,MUST FIND A WAY TO WATCH THIS
RuPauls Drag Race,Can't put into words how glad I am David Walliams hasn't sidled his way in...
RuPauls Drag Race,Why the fuck is it on BBC3 and not terrestrial television? 
RuPauls Drag Race,*emits Father Noel Furlong shriek*
RuPauls Drag Race,I’d much rather Noel fielding be a part of this than bake off...he can be their resident santino for the first few seasons.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Please God, no! Save us! "
RuPauls Drag Race,I’m hoping VH1 airs it in the US.
RuPauls Drag Race,You just did 
RuPauls Drag Race,I thought they got rid of BBC 3 and made it an iPlayer thing?
RuPauls Drag Race,"They did, which is why it's so strange that the BBC would pay for a hit show like this and shove it on the online service."
RuPauls Drag Race,"It’s weird. But it’s a show for young people, young people like to stream and the BBC want to compete with Netflix in that regard so it does kind of make sense."
RuPauls Drag Race,"Well they haven't really had a ""hit"" show on BBC3 since moving it online to my knowledge. This could be a thing to try and get people to go on it more."
RuPauls Drag Race,"I dunno, my wife (30+) loves this kind of program. 

I imagine a lot of the reality viewers like her will want to watch. "
RuPauls Drag Race,To be fair it's not been an online platform for very long. Still think it was a strange decision.
RuPauls Drag Race,It will probably air late night on BBC 1 too. Most BBC 3 shows do. 
RuPauls Drag Race,"You have a lot to catch up on, legit one of the best shows on right now."
RuPauls Drag Race,My wife loves that show!  I don’t really know anything about it but “This ain’t Ru Paul’s Best Friends Race” is one the funniest lines I’ve ever heard in a reality show and now it’s said in my house at least once a week.
RuPauls Drag Race,You streaming it? My wife loves it but cant find it on Hulu or netflix
RuPauls Drag Race,Season 5 of this show is probably the best season of any reality tv show I've ever seen. It's incredible television.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Got high with my cousin one day and watched the first episode of whichever season it was that Bianca del Rio won. 'Ru Paul' was a name I was aware of, vaguely, but I'd never watched... But I got hooked that day. Binged three seasons in days.

And about them making art  - I guess you could say the same of other shows, but at least drag is really suited to a visual medium like TV. It's easier to see if someone's comedy chops or frock is good than it is with a cake. And the drag queens are more or less bound to have entertaining personalities. "
RuPauls Drag Race,It is easily one of my favorite shows there is. Vanjie is absolutely killing it this season and I am loving every second. 
RuPauls Drag Race,"Love the show! Even if there is fuckery that goes on in the recent seasons, I continue to enjoy it!"
RuPauls Drag Race,Do you believe in milk and cookies?
RuPauls Drag Race,This would be extremely popular if able to stream in the US.  
RuPauls Drag Race,">what separates this show from other reality television shows is that the people are creating art

It's not the only show that does this.  That's why I like to watch Top Chef & Project Runway.  I can't cook for shit & am pretty unfashionable, but I love watching talented creative people get challenged & turn simple ingredients into something amazing."
RuPauls Drag Race,"If you want another art based reality show, Face Off is pretty great. It's a competition between make-up/prosthetic artists. All the episodes are streaming on Syfy  

https://www.syfy.com/faceoff "
RuPauls Drag Race,I'm pretty sure there is a dedicated sub to this show that is very active and all fanatics like you are. Sounds like you should prob check it out . Share your joy. 
RuPauls Drag Race,"If this season got you hooked, season 4 will change your life.  There used to be seasons where all the queens were memorable and didn't all look like they learned drag from the same YouTube tutorial. "
RuPauls Drag Race,Isnt ru paul a transphobe?
RuPauls Drag Race,Unfortunately I think only a couple seasons are available on Amazon Prime. I watch the new season by Chrome casting with the VH1 app.
RuPauls Drag Race,"If you’re outside of the US it should be be on Netflix. If you’re in the US, it’s notoriously hard to find :( iTunes has all the seasons but they are pricey. A lot of the episodes of Untucked are on YouTube though"
RuPauls Drag Race,All the seasons and current untucked is on my Netflix. 
RuPauls Drag Race,With All Stars Season 2 coming in at a close second... since it was basically Season 5 Part 2
RuPauls Drag Race,"Hello, Hello, Hello, Christine!"
RuPauls Drag Race,Ive never watched that show.  But thanks Reddit for showing me such an amazing part of it.
RuPauls Drag Race,I didn't even know that she did a performance on that show.
RuPauls Drag Race,I saw her recreate this live and it was magnificent
RuPauls Drag Race,[deleted]
RuPauls Drag Race,Did he die?
RuPauls Drag Race,eeeew
RuPauls Drag Race,I loooove your username!!
RuPauls Drag Race,"The drag queens are performing a lip sync of Natalie Cole’s “This Will Be” in front of Natalie Cole herself, who sadly has passed away yes."
RuPauls Drag Race,"Ah, how sad. I only watch the British version on the BBC iplayer so I don't know the people mentioned here. Thanks."
RuPauls Drag Race,All of the main seasons are on uk Netflix
RuPauls Drag Race,lol this thread sinking like a rock really brings home how much of a bubble the drag race community is and how much bigger the show seems if you're a fan of it. 
RuPauls Drag Race,Nice... but wtf is up with that photo of RuPaul?
RuPauls Drag Race,weeerrrrkkkk
RuPauls Drag Race,"If Shangela doesn't win on her fourth try, it might be time to hang up the heels for good."
RuPauls Drag Race,You know what would make this show WAY better? Actual drag racing! 
RuPauls Drag Race,Seriously. I know the show is hardly made for the masses but this post has been taken out back and beaten up. Even over on the Drag Race sub this news is barely registering.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Tons of photoshop, probably "
RuPauls Drag Race,The season one filter got taken to its logical extreme.
RuPauls Drag Race,My guess is the whole purpose of this little ~~PR stunt~~ Christmas party is to erase some of the hostility over the shitshow that was All Stars 3. My guess is Shangela has this one in the bag. 
RuPauls Drag Race,There was Drag Racing with Drag Queens when Jackass did an MTV 24 hour takeover IIRC. Or maybe it was human giant.
RuPauls Drag Race,"Oh maybe it's something to do with it being a Christmas special too...

Oh well. I **love** Slay Belles and the old Xmas special, so I'm fuckin **pumped**"
RuPauls Drag Race,That would have been awesome. Wish I'd seen it. 
Dinosaur Train,"She served as an executive for Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network both, and both runs were during some of their best years. I have high faith in her selecting quality projects for kids."
Dinosaur Train,"Man...I'm not saying it's a bad show but the wild kratts drive me up the fucking wall. They have access to multiple pieces of completely ground-breaking technology and make the DUMBEST GODDAMN DECISIONS with it. Like they were studying ~~grizzly~~  black bears and ~~one of them activates into a bear to get into a salmon-fishing competition with a real bear~~, they track two bears catching fish to see who gets more, and one of the brothers gets into a salmon-sized boat that looks JUST LIKE a fucking salmon and SWIMS INTO THE EXACT AREA WHERE REAL FUCKING BEARS ARE TRYING TO CATCH SALMON and QUELLE FUCKING SURPRISE, a bear catches this fucking miracle of technology and tries to EAT IT.

Sorry. I've been carrying that around for a while.

Edit: mis-remembered a few details. The point still stands."
Dinosaur Train,Odd Squad is awesome.
Dinosaur Train,Dinosaur Train sounds like a badass metal band
Dinosaur Train,Grownnnnnn ups come back.
Dinosaur Train,My 2 year old loves Daniel Tigers Neighborhood.... and I love getting the little reminders of Mr Rogers. So she’s a-ok in my book and I’m happy for her success.
Dinosaur Train,Odd Squad FTW
Dinosaur Train,"Dinosaur Train is pretty fun for my oldest, but I really like Wild Kratts and love Odd Squad. I just turned 36."
Dinosaur Train,"If she's also responsible for Pinkalicious, my 3 year old may have single handedly secured the promotion for her."
Dinosaur Train,"I had some friends shit on Daniel Tiger as ""it wasn't made by the Roger's estate"" a few years ago. So I assumed it was shit.

Flash forward to me having toddler and I am realizing it's the best show on TV to teach kids how to be a decent human being. (t also makes me realize the kind of behaviors I need to exhibit as a parent, too)

Just because a piece of media is made outside the legacy of a prominent figure doesn't mean it can't be amazing."
Dinosaur Train,"My 3 year old loves all of those shows.

&#x200B;

I approve."
Dinosaur Train,"Daniel Tiger is great. Wholesome, with lots of teaching moments for both kids and adults."
Dinosaur Train,All my favorite shows
Dinosaur Train,"Odd Squad is great, and Wild Kratts is good enough.  My kid likes them both, but even I, as an adult, somewhat enjoy OddSquad."
Dinosaur Train,Odd Squad rules.
Dinosaur Train,Good! She’s great! And give PBS funding too!
Dinosaur Train,"PBS Kids is the only subscription service my family pays for. My boys enjoy all these shows. Actually, my wife and I do too.
 
Based on the shows listed and Linda’s overall track record, I’m looking forward to what’s coming next. It should be great."
Dinosaur Train,Who made Paw Patrol? ...'cuz they need to be exorcised and sealed in a floating tomb of holy water
Dinosaur Train,/r/danieltigerconspiracy
Dinosaur Train,Good! We need moar Dinosaur Train things! My youngest who isn’t even born yet will give me an excuse to watch it again.
Dinosaur Train,Molly of Denali is my jam
Dinosaur Train,She knows what to do
Dinosaur Train,I miss just old school Mr. Rogers
Dinosaur Train,We did most of these with our son. I hope for all the best things for her:)
Dinosaur Train,"Idk what odd squad is, but the rest are pretty good. Dinosaur Train is something I would want to dislike, but I’d stick up for it if some other show was bullying it."
Dinosaur Train,My son and I have some good memorable times watching Wild kratts 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Dinosaur Train,She deserves it! I have a 6 and 5 year old boys and they grew up on those shows! My wife and I ended up liking them as much or more as our boys
Dinosaur Train,"My kids like most of the above shows, but for me, **Peg + Cat** is where it's at."
Dinosaur Train,Congratulations Linda!
Dinosaur Train,"The Kratt bothers are still around? Damn, I didn’t know they were still making shows. I still remember Kratt’s Creatures and Zaboomafoo."
Dinosaur Train,"Just FYI, PBS Kids is free steaming live on their website. Important bookmark for the living room PC!"
Dinosaur Train,"Lol, saw the thumbnail and I was like why is Weird Al associated with this?"
Dinosaur Train,I was hoping that satan Caillou was not on her resume and am greatly relieved
Dinosaur Train,Those are the four shows that my kids like.
Dinosaur Train,bring back zoom
Dinosaur Train,Dinosaur train. Dinosaur train.
Dinosaur Train,"Basically all the best shows.  I’m not young anymore and I still think they’re all awesome.

....Now the dinosaur train song is stuck in my head.... damnit"
Dinosaur Train,"Oh no, not Odd Squad."
Dinosaur Train,"I watch all this shit all morning before getting the kids ready for school, and I love Nature Cat!"
Dinosaur Train,"I watch dinosaur train after the kids go to sleep, no shame."
Dinosaur Train,The first time I watched Dinosaur train like 9 years ago I was half asleep half dreaming with a screaming 3 month old in my arms and I thought I was hallucinating. My son and I still sit down to watch the time traveling dinosaurs because it’s something we shared and it’s completely bonkers. And the equally bonkers odd squad is one of the strangest funniest shows I’ve ever seen.
Dinosaur Train,Of course the promote a woman since in todays world if you promote a man you are sexist and oppressing.
Dinosaur Train,Hopefully she can bring it back to level of 90s PBS
Dinosaur Train,"Why doesn't Daniel Tiger wear pants?  Or his dad.  Everyone else seems to wear pants, dresses, or skirts.  Daniel wears PJ pants and snow pants, but most of the time he's out there freeballing it.  Why?  This is a show that deals with serious issues like the potty and dealing with strangers.  Daniel should be wearing pants."
Dinosaur Train,Wild Kratts depict predators as malicious animals. Total bullshit and misleading.  Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood is mindless garbage.
Dinosaur Train,"Look I know I'm biased because I'm an adult and I wasn't raised on any of those shows, but they all pail in comparison to their predecessors. Kids really have to settle for Daniel Tiger and Wild Kratts when we were getting Mr. Rogers and Zoboomafoo? Give them some good shows. Odd Squad is the only thing listed there that didn't make me roll my eyes and that's because I only know it by it's name."
Dinosaur Train,Daniel Tiger would make a nice rug tbh.
Dinosaur Train,If both my kids are indicators her track record is phenomenal
Dinosaur Train,That's a lot more relevant to the new position than shows she's directed. Makes me more confident.
Dinosaur Train,It makes me miss Zoboomafoo.  But I do love the Kratt Bros so we still watch Wild Kratts.
Dinosaur Train,"I thought Wild Kratts was live action for a second so I was majorly confused until I looked it up... ohhh


https://youtu.be/Vqj-r83ywUc?t=1170"
Dinosaur Train,LMAO so mad that the French came out
Dinosaur Train,See you on the creature trail!
Dinosaur Train,"I was about to be mad at first, and by th he end I was rolling. I can totally relate"
Dinosaur Train,"I think we made a lot of good progress today. Wait here please, and we'll schedule your next appointment."
Dinosaur Train,"If they really want to perform a Creature Rescue, they’d shrink herds of cattle, put them to grange for a month on a half acre, then bring them back to size. No more clear cutting the Amazon."
Dinosaur Train,"You definitely have kids and have been watching Wild Kratts with them. That one is definitely not my favorite for the reason you stated, so it's usually when I tune out a little and read."
Dinosaur Train,"Honestly, that sounds hilarious."
Dinosaur Train,I have similar feelings about Vampirina. That show seemed so cute at first but now its permanently banned in our house because it pisses me off so much.
Dinosaur Train,The Kratt brothers when they appear on the show in the real look bizarrely different than their young and spry animated counterparts. I feel like they really dropped the ball on more accurately portraying middle aged dudes.
Dinosaur Train,"How did they react to it, being their fault and all? Maybe the point of it was to teach kids not to get angry at animals for behaving as they obviously would and to act accordingly around them (i.e do not become salmon shaped in front of a bear and then put it down when it attacks you)."
Dinosaur Train,"This happens all the time on this show. 
My problem, though, is how narcissistic it is. Chris and Martin Kratt create, write and produce a show about themselves. They give the main characters their names and have them always out in the wildest landscape, seeing amazing sites, saving the environment, with the most amazing tech especially built for them. With the people essentially following them about driving them about and inventing things for them.
The way they talk about how they love to see animals fighting each other. Some of this just weirds me out."
Dinosaur Train,"Odd Squad is one of the weirdest shows I've ever randomly seen. [Like full on Adult Swim level weirdness.](https://youtu.be/XdENWz0zIus)


I guess spoilers for a kids show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HHeaULkIk"
Dinosaur Train,Love me some Odd Squad!
Dinosaur Train,"that show is fuckin wild man, spy kids meets scp foundation."
Dinosaur Train,"I love the cop show parody jokes that only adults would get. I love all the weird quirks they bring out of each character, like how Agent Otto eats soup weird.

It's a house favorite."
Dinosaur Train,"Odd Squad is the goods. Actually, if anyone involved is reading this, there’s a little girl I love named Oswin and she soaks up everything about each episode. Almost five years old and a huge fan.She’s able to follow the math concepts but she’s studying the humor too. 

Anyways, what I’m saying is  “O” names are cool and if she ever heard her name on the show? I think she would run squealing through the house for at least half an hour. Just tossing that wishing coin out into the internet wishing well. (That said, I have no clue when this show was made or if new episodes are even being produced)"
Dinosaur Train,I’m super impressed by their set designs. Always wondered how they got the budget for it.
Dinosaur Train,My kids love it...almost as much as my wife and I do. If this was on when I was a kid I’d be downright OBSESSED with the show. As an adult though I’m equally impressed with the performances they get out of the kid actors as I am with the writing/world building/sets/etc. They must pick just the right kids and then have people on set working absolute magic with them.
Dinosaur Train,"Odd Squad is this generation's MathNet, basically."
Dinosaur Train,"Odd Squad pisses me off. You notice, all the competent characters have to be attractive. The fat kid is, surprise surprise, an idiot who calls himself Potato. Only attractive girls can lead in the show. The less attractive girls are nerds, dorks, etc. Pretty pathetic stereotyping if you ask me. It's the only PBS Kids show I won't let my kid watch.

Edit: guess I found where all the incels went. Touched a nerve, didn't I?"
Dinosaur Train,It’s also a metal concept: a train filled with dinosaurs run by velociraptors that travels through time.
Dinosaur Train,"Dinosaur Train, dinosaur train, Dinosaur Train, dinosaur train
we are going to riiiiiiiiiiide the Dinosaur Train!"
Dinosaur Train,[Dinosaur Warfare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUUaMD2l7Ms)
Dinosaur Train,"When you have to go potty *STOP!* -- and go riiight awaaay.

We just started potty training our little one and this show has been a major help."
Dinosaur Train,"When something is new, holding a hand can help you"
Dinosaur Train,My wife works graveyard at a hospital so I sing this to our 5 y/o almost every night. Some nights are harder then others for her.
Dinosaur Train,"God-tier public transportation and for some reason Daddy Tiger and Grandpere don’t wear pants, but Mama Tiger does."
Dinosaur Train,"Can Blue fish play, tomorrow?

No... Blue fish cant play anymore."
Dinosaur Train,Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood acts like they are teaching kids but they are low-key incepting ideas on how to be a good parent.
Dinosaur Train,"My two year old demands “the kitty show” daily.   I feel like bad parent letting her veg in front of the tv but it buys me so much time for chores and self-care!  Plus, it’s educational and not horribly annoying to listen to.   

We’ve started teaching daddy the cleanup song and will probably hit others as we go."
Dinosaur Train,"I was not aware of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood until my son was born, and so far removed from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood that I didn't even realize what I was watching until the end (I didn't hear the opening theme).

I actually teared up from the flood of childhood memories that came back while I held my infant son. It also comforted me to know that he will have exposure to the same quality material I did, if not better than what I watched back in the 80s/90s."
Dinosaur Train,"Coming from a masculine household and not being able to properly convey my emotions, DT and my daughter have helped me tremendously"
Dinosaur Train,My sons a year and a half and loves the show. It’s really good imo.
Dinosaur Train,Hell yeah...
Dinosaur Train,Wild Kratts is great. Family favorite here too. PBS kids app could use some help though. I’d pay for content on it.
Dinosaur Train,"pinkalicious is the female caillou, and i fuckin hate caillou."
Dinosaur Train,"I'm not sure I'd say it's outside his legacy. I mean would you rather a show be made by the guy's estate or by [his production company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers_Productions), including many of the people who worked with him?"
Dinosaur Train,I can only watch so much of it because I miss Mr. Rogers so much somedays
Dinosaur Train,Disney
Dinosaur Train,What the fuck did I just walk into
Dinosaur Train,A way for adults who are forced to watch kids' shows to derive entertainment from it
Dinosaur Train,"My god, thank you for this. Now I have to dig up the outline for the YA action adventure I almost wrote as a sequel to Jim Henson’s Pajanimals."
Dinosaur Train,Cheers!
Dinosaur Train,"I grew up watching Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and I firmly believe that he would be rather disappointed with the spiritual successor to his show. Many who loved his show may remember his prominent display of the yellow traffic light as a reminder to ""slow down."" The frenetic pace of Daniel Tiger sells out on that point completely, electing instead to cater to over-stimulated i-pad children just to stay competitive. I think this show would fall closer to the TV that Fred Rogers ""hated"" when he struck out to do something better.

I low key fucking hate Daniel Tiger"
Dinosaur Train,Same. My 2 year old loves it and I’m fine with her choice
Dinosaur Train,You can watch some episodes on the PBS Kids app.
Dinosaur Train,Odd Squad is like “what if the MIB or SCP Foundation was only run by kids and they learn math and stuff while trying to contain weird aliens in Canada”. It’s legitimately good.
Dinosaur Train,All of those shows are still on demand via their website. My 3yo enjoys Daniel *and* Mr. Rogers.
Dinosaur Train,Odd squad has some good jokes even for adults.
Turbo FAST,"Thanks Tubi, your ad made my father start yelling at me because he thought I changed the channel!"
Turbo FAST,That's not how separation anxiety works Amazon
Turbo FAST,Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul love being Walt and Jesse so much.
Turbo FAST,"The gimmick this year seems to be multiple celebrities in the same commercial. They open with one celeb, which doesn't surprise anyone, but the stinger is that they have another celeb in the same commercial!
  
Like all gimmicks, it gets old pretty quick. The ones that aren't relying on star power look good in comparison."
Turbo FAST,"If they don’t tell me what that QR code is for, I’m not fucking scanning it. Fuck right off with that bullshit."
Turbo FAST,Whatever happened to the guy who used to compile all the ads in one comment thread? I miss that.
Turbo FAST,Dunkin commercial has been the best so far. That’s not saying much.
Turbo FAST,Tubi: Home of all the weird movies your old off-beat video store used to carry.
Turbo FAST,Miller vs. Coors vs. Blue Moon was fun in the moment! ...but then depressing when you realize all the beer brands are owned by the same company
Turbo FAST,"Did they decide to save the funny commercials for the fourth quarter?  Sarah McLachlan in a Busch beer commercial, parodying her ASPCA ads was pretty amusing."
Turbo FAST,Recreating old movie scenes seems to be the new trend
Turbo FAST,"There ain't NO WAY in hell Snoop Dogg is wearing sketchers.

Also, is U2 behind all these damn balloons? I see...."
Turbo FAST,"Glad that dog ad stopped when it did. 

I was pretty scared there for a minute."
Turbo FAST,I liked that commercial with Adam Driver but I've already forgotten what the product was.
Turbo FAST,"Lol, Tuco in the Breaking Bad commercial. Was just missing Jesse calling Walt a bitch."
Turbo FAST,Did *not* expect that one to be a commercial for Remy
Turbo FAST,no fuckin way they made an unidentified balloon ad
Turbo FAST,That tubi menu got me (I thought something went wrong!) - though the transition straight into a Fox Nation commercial was really confusing
Turbo FAST,Is Rihanna pregnant again?
Turbo FAST,Why is Rhianna wearing boob armor?
Turbo FAST,Really thought they put Matt Damon in a shoe commercial. Not that it was a movie about shoes.
Turbo FAST,The farmer dating show seems like it would be an SNL skit
Turbo FAST,Keyboard Cat Lives!
Turbo FAST,"Anyone else remember when SB ads were designed to be funny and have some originality? 

Now it's find whatever celebrity is somewhat notable and play it safe."
Turbo FAST,Alicia Silverstone is still hot
Turbo FAST,"Fun to see Paramount+ with a new series of ""mountain"" commercials. (Not sure if this one was exactly Super Bowl worthy, but last fall they made one to bring back Key & Peele's substitute teacher character which I loved) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEdNAzv1LD8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEdNAzv1LD8)"
Turbo FAST,BEWARE AMERICA. BUNNIES ARE COMING.
Turbo FAST,I’m glad i’m not the only one who thinks the cisco hold music is bangin’
Turbo FAST,That workday commercial. BRAVO
Turbo FAST,"I'm up 3 hours past my bedtime. You can't be messing with me like that, Tubi."
Turbo FAST,"Not a mobile ad!

Edit: It's for NFTs again!"
Turbo FAST,What is with these Dog commercials and hitting us in the feels lately?
Turbo FAST,"I’ll give the Workday “rockstar” commercial this, they had good enough judgement NOT to use Gene Simmons."
Turbo FAST,"So, uh, do we think the U2 commercial with the giant floating sphere was made before the whole China spy balloon thing? Because that's all that I was thinking when I was watching it"
Turbo FAST,"Was wondering why Tubi's being promoted so heavily. Turns out, they're owned by Fox."
Turbo FAST,Thanks for hanging out everyone! I included as many commercials as I could find!
Turbo FAST,So these commercials have been dogshit right?
Turbo FAST,Cisco hold music is the best
Turbo FAST,God bless WeatherTech for putting a normal ass boring commercial in the Superbowl ever year
Turbo FAST,Gambling ads 🤮
Turbo FAST,"god, that Dunkin Bennifer commercial entertained me more than it should've"
Turbo FAST,"I wonder if the new Indiana Jones movie will mention Mutt, or if Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is ignored."
Turbo FAST,That Rabbit Hole commercial was the scariest thing I've ever seen.
Turbo FAST,"Just got told to not do my taxes on national TV, what a world"
Turbo FAST,These commercials haven’t been very good.
Turbo FAST,I can’t believe it took us this long for a Bud Light commercial
Turbo FAST,That Busch Light commercial actually made me chuckle.
Turbo FAST,"Thinking ""VMS"" is the name of a Kpop band is a pretty fair guess, tbh."
Turbo FAST,TUCO! Popcorners win
Turbo FAST,Wait... are you telling me all these balloons were ACTUALLY from U2?!
Turbo FAST,"This is the same Matt Damon who was all in on crypto last year, and you're trusting him to go all in on an unknown basketball player???

Also we have too many damn stories about the beginning of Nike"
Turbo FAST,Best so Far... Will Ferrell bravo
Turbo FAST,Help the Red M&M!
Turbo FAST,"""We see you""

Me at home

""NO YOU FUCKING DON'T"""
Turbo FAST,Anything with Ben Stiller in it cracks me up for some reason. Loved that Pepsi commercial.
Turbo FAST,The Farmer’s Dog commercial hit close to home. Had to put our 16 year old dog to sleep last month.
Turbo FAST,Surely Pixel could've come up with better examples for photo editing besides removing people in the background fro 30 seconds?
Turbo FAST,"Was last year the one with all the crypto ads(Larry Sanders FTX)? Ah,how things change...."
Turbo FAST,Ngl that bud light commercial was extremely cute
Turbo FAST,"Lol, in the age of misinformation, nothing like advertising the ability to super easily edit and erase our photo histories on our phones"
Turbo FAST,"A rated R movie based on Air Jordans...

If I didn't just see the trailer, I would've never believed that premise was real."
Turbo FAST,"I know the night is young, but I'm still kinda surprised we haven't had a car ad yet. Usually we'd see at least one serious, monologue-y ad by now."
Turbo FAST,"So you shouldn't scan QR codes when you don't know what they are, but *you definitely shouldn't* scan a QR code to watch a roast of Mr Peanut"
Turbo FAST,They're killing it with these dog ads
Turbo FAST,Wait have all the UFOs been promotion for fucking U2
Turbo FAST,Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch jumpscare
Turbo FAST,Always a treat to hear Kenny Loggins!
Turbo FAST,That Prime drink is DISGUSTING
Turbo FAST,"Wait, was that Michael Keaton?"
Turbo FAST,The Farmers Dog was a sweet commercial. Gotta go wake up my 14-year old dog and give her pets now.
Turbo FAST,"That Farmer’s Dog commercial really hit home with me. Had a 15 year old chocolate lab put down a few years ago and still not over it.

Really great commercial."
Turbo FAST,They're really pushing this farmer dating show lol.
Turbo FAST,Am I the only person who wishes Mr. Peanut had a mid-Atlantic/British Accent? The idea of him having an American accent always felt weird to me.
Turbo FAST,"Way too many ""Scan the QR"" code commercials"
Turbo FAST,Jesus commercial worst commercial of the night
Turbo FAST,"Giving how many signs and adverts, I see that Google is going hard at announcing the they snagged NFL Sunday Ticket away from DirectTV for YouTubeTV."
Turbo FAST,Rihanna dancing with a bunch of marshmallows has been kind of cool.
Turbo FAST,The RAM REV commercial did get a chuckle out of me.
Turbo FAST,"Okay, an ED pill mock commercial is funny, but it being for an electric truck is interesting..."
Turbo FAST,Tubi probably has the most effective one. I've never hooked my TV up to the internet and the remote was on the coffee table but it had like 7 people screaming at me for about 10 seconds lol
Turbo FAST,The Jesus ad is cringe AF. Can't have a pro cannabis ad but let's have a Jesus ad.
Turbo FAST,"Well, that Tubi commercial wasn't *at all* creepy."
Turbo FAST,"Well, that Fast X trailer knows exactly what it's going for...surprised to see Jason Momoa show up there, I didn't know he was going to be in it!"
Turbo FAST,Are you still a rock star if you're doing a commercial for finance software?
Turbo FAST,"Hulu is counting the halftime show as an ad based on the little watermark they have in the corner. 

Madlads."
Turbo FAST,I watched Jane dine on some delicious Pop Corners
Turbo FAST,I am shocked they didn't get either Bill Murray or  Chevy Chase for that Michelob commercial.
Turbo FAST,Fuck Scientology
Turbo FAST,"I'm not loving someone who hates me for my race, this commercial sucks"
Turbo FAST,Awww... giving him a friend instead of locking him away in a kennel after he was depressed :')
Turbo FAST,That premature electrafication ad was great
Turbo FAST,John Travolta reliving his Grease days
Turbo FAST,I don’t know who I’m more mad at for the Grease commercial
Turbo FAST,So are all these Chinese spy balloons a big advertisement for U2's new concert?
Turbo FAST,I could watch Steve Martin do anything. Excited to see who else Pepsi got for those commercials.
Turbo FAST,"**Arrested Development Narrator:** ""He was acting."""
Turbo FAST,"Damn, hearing ""What Does the Fox Say?"" again was a major blast from the past!"
Turbo FAST,Ok that RAM EV ad was great.
Turbo FAST,FUCK EZRA MILLER
Turbo FAST,Damn they really paid to air this Animal Control ad twice?
La Reina del Sur,I'd have rather seen a promo for this show i've never heard of.
La Reina del Sur,[Here's a post with the trailer for the series.](https://www.reddit.com/r/queenofthesouth/comments/4pnhx1/queen_of_the_south_extended_trailer_new_series_on/)
La Reina del Sur,"Whatever I was expecting, it wasn’t this. Not disappointed at all, this is gold"
La Reina del Sur,"This is absolutely incredible. Holy shit, it goes right to 100 immediately and then just KEEPS going."
La Reina del Sur,This is a meme classic. When she turns over the wheelchair lol
La Reina del Sur,"This is a wild show. My mother loved it.

&#x200B;

Edit: I had to go see if I was remembering the show correctly, when passing through the living room and seeing the insanity. A brief review from wikipedia says,

>In an attempt to reconcile with Nando, Soraya arranges a party and invites him. Nando goes to see Alicia and Soraya, who has a crisis of psychopathy, beats her, hits Esperanza against the wall and cuts Nando with a pair of scissors. Alicia is saved by Aldo, and Nando goes to a hospital, where he is admitted. María reported Soraya but she pretends to be innocent. With the idea of revenge, Soraya finds her mother, Calixta. Calixta, too poor and ill, lives as a beggar, and recognizes her daughter. Feeling hatred towards her own mother, she pushes Calixta, who hits her head and dies."
La Reina del Sur,"You could literally make about 37,000 gifs from this scene alone, how did only one “make it famous”."
La Reina del Sur,My favorite part is how more and more people arrive but jut stare at the show. It would only be more realistic if they all pulled out their cell phones and started filming it.
La Reina del Sur,That slug insult was pretty harsh
La Reina del Sur,"Cliffhanger! He didn’t really die from an elbow stabbing, did he!?"
La Reina del Sur,"https://youtu.be/kSJDgREaeVs

Seeing this reminds me of this hilarious Funny or Die video, Telenovelas are Hell that covers Maria del Barrio."
La Reina del Sur,That guy looks like eric from boy meets world
La Reina del Sur,The watchword.... is subtlety.
La Reina del Sur,"In case y'all never saw Orange is the New Black poking fun at this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPsCw8w45Q"
La Reina del Sur,"That’s it. We need an English remake starring Casey Wilson, stat!"
La Reina del Sur,And I thought the last episode of moon knight was intense.
La Reina del Sur,"Telenovelas used to be wildly popular in my country back in the 90s, I forgot how intense and highly emotional the characters can be. Maria del Barrio even had a local adaptation, but none of those tops Marimar though."
La Reina del Sur,"Shits wild. Also, as a native Spanish speaker some parts of the subtitles were not accurate but just made it funnier."
La Reina del Sur,"Someone once said to me, ""Telenovelas are just like British Soap Operas - just as intense.""

...Telenovelas are just insane all the time. British shows are mostly quiet, but then they really go there on rare occasions. Like Christmas."
La Reina del Sur,saw this before bed and this is the best 'thats enough of reddit for today' moment i've ever had
La Reina del Sur,Thank you. That was wonderful!
La Reina del Sur,"I remember when this show was on, for some reason I always had to watch it whenever I passed by it changing channels. I don't even speak Spanish, but it was so bad  you couldn't not watch it."
La Reina del Sur,I swear mexico and bollywood just plagiarize each other in an endless cycle.
La Reina del Sur,This is absolutely hilarious.
La Reina del Sur,Such an iconic scene. I would've been glued to the screen had I watched this on TV.
La Reina del Sur,"This clip has been imprinted in my soul for years. 
It's just perfect cringe. It is a rarity. Nothing comes close. 
It should be protected for posterity"
La Reina del Sur,Seeing the one ginger dude made me think how this wouldn’t be out of place on Riverdale.
La Reina del Sur,Telenovelas peaked here
La Reina del Sur,Looks like something Jack Donaghy had to micro-manage
La Reina del Sur,Now... THAT escalated quickly!
La Reina del Sur,"OMG, what did I just watch? This is hilarious."
La Reina del Sur,"Nandito is trying very hard not to touch her boobs, which I find very funny."
La Reina del Sur,Was anyone else expecting a cut to the mac and me clip
La Reina del Sur,"Go Punisher on them, girl ! They deserve it ."
La Reina del Sur,"Deam, is like watching pro wrestling"
La Reina del Sur,She tips the crip at 1:26.
La Reina del Sur,"ahahah, that's some shounen villain level of rage, glad Cristiano Ronaldo was finally able to restrain her. Did Nandito die though?"
La Reina del Sur,"So, did Nandito die from the stabbing? Please use spoiler tags so as not to spoil the show for others!"
La Reina del Sur,"First, that woman is giving complete Casey Wilson vibes. Second. I don’t everyone walking in at the end like “what in the fuck is going on in here??”"
La Reina del Sur,"This makes a few episodes of Arrested Development s1 even funnier.  

https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/El_Amor_Prohibido"
La Reina del Sur,Reminds of that clown telenovela scene that kept popping up in The Soup with Joel Mchale.
La Reina del Sur,"Here in Chile even my mom knows that meme, and she barely uses Whatsapp."
La Reina del Sur,An iconic moment in mexican television
La Reina del Sur,I stumbled across this clip a few years ago. I seriously couldn’t stop laughing.
La Reina del Sur,Which Episode Is This?
La Reina del Sur,"Every character is emotionally at 11, except for the main lady who's at about 23."
La Reina del Sur,"It gets wilder.
Calixta is a witch.  Maria is Nando’s mom by her adoptive brother, and is like 15.
Maria sold him to a random woman for sausages, anyway she finds him 15 years later.
Soraya dies a couple times and tries to bbq Maria twice."
La Reina del Sur,"This used to play in my home country of Cyprus of all places, alongside stuff like Rosalinda and some other similar telenovelas. Pretty hilarious stuff honestly ."
La Reina del Sur,I mean all telenovelas are weird
La Reina del Sur,"Lmao

Every frame a painting, but absolutely insane gifs."
La Reina del Sur,"For some reason I can't stop trying to picture the rehearsal, and how they managed to co ordinate all this entirely counterintuitive shuffling around."
La Reina del Sur,"I like the part where wheel chair girl says ""she killed you both for protecting me"" but the dude is very clearly still alive. Novelas are wild."
La Reina del Sur,">Take the girl and go!

*stops at the door*"
La Reina del Sur,the only reason they didnt is because it's '95
La Reina del Sur,">It would only be more realistic if they all pulled out their cell phones and started filming it.

It was 1995. That wasn't possible."
La Reina del Sur,I lost it when Cristiano Ronaldo walked in. Dude's an even better actor than he is at sports.
La Reina del Sur,"This is the best part. Nobody called the police and/or an ambulance. There are like 10 people in this room as if the first ones said to the others ""hey! come see this shit on the second floor!"" 😂🤣"
La Reina del Sur,Unless you’re Oliver P Morton post-stroke who somehow made getting called a slug sound bad*** dragging his paralyzed self around the Capital.
La Reina del Sur,"When, in the entire history of humanity, has anybody ever died from an elbow stabbing?"
La Reina del Sur,"I hopelessly check Funny or Die's youtube channel every now and then to see if there's a new Telenovelas Are Hell. 

There never is. :("
La Reina del Sur,"Reminds me of the Chris Farley decaffeinated coffee crystals sketch. “Sir, did you know you’re not drinking regular coffee but Colombian decaffeinated coffee crystals?”

https://youtu.be/VdQKVDUBu2g"
La Reina del Sur,"All these years I have resisted OITNB for some reason, and looking at this clip I see I may have been mistaken."
La Reina del Sur,"…how tf do you cry in Span… ohhh, right. Yeah that’s right. -me"
La Reina del Sur,Can i amend that to be Casey Wilson as Penny from Happy Endings?
La Reina del Sur,"> Someone once said to me, ""Telenovelas are just like British Soap Operas - just as intense.""

Yeah, that guy fucking lied. That made British soaps look like The Wire."
La Reina del Sur,And continuously!
La Reina del Sur,"This thing started to convince me that telenovelas are on to something because a) I could not take my eyes off the screen, and b) I was DESPERATE to know what happened next."
La Reina del Sur,Spinal tap 11
La Reina del Sur,Every sentence more thrilling than the last.
La Reina del Sur,Sold for sausages!
La Reina del Sur,well that certainly escalated
La Reina del Sur,"I've only ever met one person from Cyprus in my life and the first thing they mentioned when they learned I was Mexican was: ""Maria la del barrio!""."
La Reina del Sur,"Nah, sometimes they're just cheesy and boring. But the more melodramatic they are the better, because that at least makes them worth the watch."
La Reina del Sur,Bold of you to assume there was a rehearsal.
La Reina del Sur,Time travel is though
La Reina del Sur,A stab to the brachial artery could kill you pretty quickly
La Reina del Sur,It's crazy that novelas I watched as a kid are apart of Telenovela from Hell. I too wish they made more and check often.
La Reina del Sur,"It was rarely like this, though it had its campy and surreal moments."
La Reina del Sur,During her mexican exchange student year in High school.
La Reina del Sur,"Well, I mean, purely for the sake of all those actors' air traffic control."
La Reina del Sur,Nandito! Noooooooooo!
La Reina del Sur,How medically accurate of them.
La Reina del Sur,"They have incredible fidelity to realism, but only in that one very specific respect."
La Reina del Sur,Thalia :D I remember her from Marimar
La Reina del Sur,"So when this first came out... this was an instant sensation. This was so talked about. This whole show was so ridiculous and yet so engaging. It was a train wreck you couldn't stop watching. 

Want to watch primetime crazy in a soap opera regardless of whatever they are saying - here is that wheelchair scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ci8m6gPHD8

The scene is so ridiculous, that decades later, Orange is the New Black did a promo with the actress eluding to that particular scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfPsCw8w45Q"
La Reina del Sur,[deleted]
La Reina del Sur,"Fun fact, she has a Trilogía de las Marías because in a short span, she did Marimar, Maria la del Barrio and Maria Mercedes"
La Reina del Sur,Someone sacrificed big time to make this video that's for sure.
La Reina del Sur,"*Malparida...*

Anyway I really thought Season 3 was gonna be on Mexico since Paquita's from there, I guess they are gonna wrap up the top Colombian stories and saving up the mexican Cartels for the next season(s)."
La Reina del Sur,"I just binged the first 3 seasons on Netflix last month, and I'm watching the current one weekly. The first three seasons were pretty amazing, but the show is losing me this season. I can't really talk about why without spoiling a lot, but let me just say that the show is (understandably) very, very different than how it was for the first three years, but it just doesn't feel like the same show I fell in love with. The stakes feel so low and it feels more like a generic crime show than the unique thrill ride it was for the first 3 years. But there's only 3 episodes so far so I'm gonna keep watching, and I would definitely still recommend it to anyone who loves crime/action/thriller shows. Even considering the dip in the current season, it's still an entertaining show that has me invested enough to keep tuning in every week even if I'm quite disappointed with the direction it's taking.

The first three seasons though is a non-stop thrill ride that has you on the edge of your seat nearly every second of every episode. Definitely very enthralling from the series premiere to the season 3 finale."
La Reina del Sur,I was interested in it knowing Snow That Product was in season 1.
La Reina del Sur,I've heard it's a bit like La Reina del Sur.
La Reina del Sur,"Agreed with your comment about the previous seasons.

I think due to the closure of that arc, she really doesn't have a credible antagonist.  This seasons, she is just being toyed by every which way.  She has considerable means and power, she should be using it.  I guess i just gotten used to how Narcos does it's thing. 

She has to let Pote loose and bury some bodies."
La Reina del Sur,"Its an American version of La Reina del Sur, but with a Brazilian acting in Kate's role."
La Reina del Sur,;)
La Reina del Sur,Only if we get to see gimple return to the character by having him team with Rick grimes as a 45 year old safety patrolman
La Reina del Sur,The amount of effort you put into that cast list....
La Reina del Sur,the fuck is fillmore?
La Reina del Sur,Damn a lot of people still watch GOT
La Reina del Sur,Poland with Trailer Park Boys in the top 10 lmao
The Walking Dead,Fully expecting them to wrap it up so they can incorporate some characters into the other upcoming TWD spin offs and ultimately a grand finale that ties all of them together.
The Walking Dead,TIL this show went more than 3 seasons
The Walking Dead,FTWD after season 3 varied from passable at best to utterly appalling
The Walking Dead,"This franchise is basically a zombie at this point. I keep thinking it's over, then I hear about it continuing to limp on"
The Walking Dead,"Always nice to hear that a show will end. Not get canceled, but getting the opportunity to wrap things up."
The Walking Dead,"I still stand by the first three seasons being genuinely great TV, and some of season six too. But I’ll always be sad we didn’t get to see the og vision for the story, and how bad it got. 

(It’s wild too how the pilot is still the highest viewed premiere for a tv series in history in terms of same day viewers)"
The Walking Dead,I didn’t even realize they made it this far
The Walking Dead,Name a more flogged dead horse. I’ll wait.
The Walking Dead,"For me, the show went downhill after Morgan came on.  Before then it wasn't perfect, but was different enough to be interesting.  And season 3 was particularly interesting IMO.  After that, it kind of became The Walking Dead 2.0, and while it did have its moments (John's character was a great addition), it was actually weaker than the main show, which was already getting a bit stale.  I do look forward to seeing how it ends, I just hope it's much better than last season was (my least favorite, easily)."
The Walking Dead,"this show has been on for EIGHT seasons??  


who has been watching this??"
The Walking Dead,"Wait, did Madison come back? I stopped watching around the time when they got rid of (what felt like) 60% of the cast, including her. I was a fan when Madison, Travis, Nick, and Alicia were the main focus."
The Walking Dead,Between this and the main show there's 19 seasons of Walking Dead tv so far. Everyone here is making fun of it but somewhere Robert Kirkman is sitting on a throne of money.
The Walking Dead,AMC is the opposite of Netflix. Run a show too long
The Walking Dead,At least it will end with Maddison
The Walking Dead,Who watched this?
The Walking Dead,This show is still on?!
The Walking Dead,But where will we turn to for redundant stories about walking and zombies and 'oh noes humans are the real monsters'?
The Walking Dead,Getting rid of Kim dickins for the bloke from twd was a travesty and where I checked the f out.
The Walking Dead,"I'm kind of amazed this show still has an audience.  The first season was so bad I checked out.   Now we have 2 more spin-offs, but is there an audience?"
The Walking Dead,This actually got 8 seasons. AMC really doesn’t know what to do lol
The Walking Dead,"This show had no real plot after they switched showrunners, they would just find themselves in a new annoying situation every 8 to 12 episodes."
The Walking Dead,The show that won’t die
The Walking Dead,I didnt even realise this was still going??!?!
The Walking Dead,How does this series stack up to TWD? I liked TWD enough but stopped with Negan’s introduction / the ridiculous fake out with Glen.
The Walking Dead,Should have ended before Alycia left. Now it’s pointless.
The Walking Dead,AMC will never kill Walking Dead. What other IP do they even have now?
The Walking Dead,Totally forgot this existed
The Walking Dead,About 5 seasons too late.
The Walking Dead,What? That show has more than one season?
The Walking Dead,I stopped when they were on that boat.  Bored to tears
The Walking Dead,That shit ended like episode 3.
The Walking Dead,Ahh 8 seasons to late I see
The Walking Dead,This show was still going on? Lol
The Walking Dead,"The quality of this series has been so up and down - but there have been times it was telling a far more interesting zombie/apocalypse story than TWD was. I stuck with it even through some very questionable storylines but there have been some great parts to it. Glad it’s ending though - I would guess some characters will go to the other projects, and I reckon the finale will be better than TWDs “Next, on the Walking Dead Universe” bullshit"
The Walking Dead,"But its going to set up another 3 or 4 spin-offs first, right?"
The Walking Dead,Can’t believe this show has 8 seasons. Walking dead killed all zombie enjoyment for me
The Walking Dead,About 5 seasons too late for me.
The Walking Dead,Could anyone tell me if this show contributed any story lore relevant to the walking dead? I stopped watching after crack Johnny deep died and they left the Mexican community. But i do know that morgan appeared
The Walking Dead,"Ya seen one dead guy with a scary weapon, ya seen ‘em all. 🙄"
The Walking Dead,I stopped watching when the nuclear missiles were launched! I just lost interest!
The Walking Dead,"""Fear the Walking Dead’ Ended With Season 2 at my house."
The Walking Dead,I can’t believe this franchise still exists. I never got into it but I certainly see endless complaints about quality about both shows. Apparently they’re even doing new spin-offs? How far off would I be to dub this Zombie Greys Anatomy?
The Walking Dead,"I tried to get into this show, but couldn't get through the first season.  I honestly thought it was cancelled after season 1 or 2, so was a surprise to hear it went on for 8.  May need to try again, as I've been hearing good things about the later seasons."
The Walking Dead,People are watching this show?
The Walking Dead,Yet another Walking Dead show that lasted WAAAAY too long.
The Walking Dead,This shit went on for 8 years?? Lol
The Walking Dead,4 seasons too late holy fucking shit!
The Walking Dead,8 SEASONS? I didn't even know this show was out.  Is time linear???
The Walking Dead,"thank you, they ruined Fear the Walking Dead when they rebooted it"
The Walking Dead,The writing FTWD got so so comically bad.
The Walking Dead,Season 7 was so bad that i stopped watching. AI would make more sensible script.
The Walking Dead,"Yay! Happy happy fucking joy!!!

I liked this show, I will admit it. It did a lot of stuff, for better or for worse, that The Walking Dead didn't. The first, second and third seasons established a great tone, set during and directly after the zombie apocalypse, and season 3 in particular was brutally good.

Season 4 came along, as did the current cast of characters and, while the show did become ""Morgan and Friends"" it still had its moments. Loved having the mobile troop carrier as a thing. Zombies in a waterpark. The episode in the hurricane (I always want weather to be a bigger part of these shows, and loved when TWD had one in the snow, but didn't have ""weather is an enemy"" as big).

Season 6, the show finally became mostly consistently good again. Early season 6 was a highlight, as the characters became scattered throughout Virginia's empire. Great that Virginia went full Negan and the show actually decided ""fuck it, let's kill her"".

But then season 7 was a huge disappointment. A nuclear zombie apocalypse should have been so much cooler, instead it felt turgid. Strand being the villain - I can go with that, that's cool, but you can't forgive him for all the shit he did at the end and row off into the sunset singing Kumbaya.

So yes, I'm glad this is ending, and hopefully a decent, conclusive ending. It's certainly been a rollercoaster in quality, and could have been way more. In the end, it just became a gritty TWD clone."
The Walking Dead,Who is still watching this? Is anyone from the original cast even still on this show? I watched the first two seasons and thought it was painfully mediocre so I checked out. Honestly can’t believe it’s still going.
The Walking Dead,It went 8 seasons? Do they ever explain what caused the zombie apocalypse?
The Walking Dead,I’m sure all of their fan will be heartbroken :(
The Walking Dead,"Holy shit. This is still on the air. 8 seasons? Wow. Serious question: is it any good ? 

I remember watching the beginning and thinking it was such an awesome concept. They never showed twd universe actually collapsing, just Rick waking up like 6 (?) months into it. I was so excited to see it. Then they pretty much glossed over it in the first few episodes of the first season. Then I kinda had hopes that they would be standalone seasons and show different parts of the world during the collapse and how they handled it. That never happened. Then I heard they killed off like the entire family from the beginning. So I just lost interest. As I did with the rest of the twd universe."
The Walking Dead,"Season one sucked. Season two sucked. Season three was awesome, so they decided to soft reboot it in season four. !?!?!
If the TWD universe ever comes to an end, the “geniuses” behind it should take their talent to Congress where they’ll fit right in."
The Walking Dead,Holy hell this show got EIGHT seasons????
The Walking Dead,I can’t believe people so watch this
The Walking Dead,Can someone explain to me what “Fear the Walking Dead” is.   I haven’t watched anything Walking Dead related since like the second season of the original show and I’m totally out of the loop
The Walking Dead,Holy crap that show is still going
The Walking Dead,There were 8 seasons?
The Walking Dead,8 seasons longer than it should have
The Walking Dead,"What do you mean, fear ended with season 3. There's nothing after that"
The Walking Dead,Someone please shoot this franchise in the head.
The Walking Dead,Do AMC have any shows left? Seems like they are cancelling absolutely everything at the start of 2023. Guess it will just be reruns and the 6 episode Walking Dead spin-off series from here on out until the day the turn out the lights for the final time…which does not look that far away!
The Walking Dead,Wow. I remember watching the first episode and thinking “nah”.
The Walking Dead,Is this show worth watching until season 3 then stopping or would it just give you blue balls. Everyone says it goes to shit afterwards and I hated Morgan in the main show so I doubt I would go past it.
The Walking Dead,Promise??
The Walking Dead,It lasted 8 seasons? I gave up after Nick died
The Walking Dead,It’s been on for eight seasons?
The Walking Dead,Is it a different show from the walking dead
The Walking Dead,"Fear went to shit when Morgan joined the show. Everything is about him and his dont kill moral bullshit. It’s unbelievable he even got a bigger role than Victor Strand.

Scott Gimple has this midas touch but instead everything he touches turns to shit."
The Walking Dead,"I checked out after what they did to John.

Last I saw fear had turned into Stephen king's the stand"
The Walking Dead,Fuck this shit
The Walking Dead,There are 8 seasons of the crappy offshoot?
The Walking Dead,Got scuuuurred of The Last of Us coming out
The Walking Dead,That shit been going for 8 seasons?!
The Walking Dead,Hope they continue to focus hard on the their Anne Rice stuff instead. Interview with the Vampire was really good.
The Walking Dead,"Good, stupid ass show"
The Walking Dead,I enjoyed season one and after that I watched it just because …
The Walking Dead,It’s been on for eight seasons?
The Walking Dead,About six seasons too late
The Walking Dead,These dead have been walking forever.
The Walking Dead,Legit thought this show already ended a year or two ago
The Walking Dead,Should have ended when Cliff Curtis or Frank Dillane left.
The Walking Dead,This is STILL on?!? 🤦‍♂️
The Walking Dead,Amazed to hear it got more than 2 seasons with how awful season 1 was.
The Walking Dead,Would have liked to watch this but there is no service that shows the early seasons so no way to start. Meh.
The Walking Dead,"For someone who hasn’t seen any walking or fear, is this a good couple series to watch, was the hype my friends showed all those years ago warranted?"
The Walking Dead,I mean they did nuke a section of Texas. Only so much you can do there
The Walking Dead,Truly didn’t know this was still running.
The Walking Dead,I usually try to avoid crapping on shows..... but Fear the Walking Dead was almost remarkably bad.  I cannot believe it lasted 8 seasons.
The Walking Dead,"I still have no idea what ""Fear the Walking Dead"" means as a title."
The Walking Dead,wow.. people still watch this trash? smh
The Walking Dead,This shit still on?
The Walking Dead,Title is incorrect. Not sure where they're getting their information cause the show actually ended after season 3.
The Walking Dead,Is AMC making anything new outside of zombies?
The Walking Dead,Season EIGHT?!
The Walking Dead,"For me, the final episode was when >!Glenn!< died. Around that time, there were just too many factions that I just couldn’t follow/keep up with anymore. I guess I just liked Walking Dead’s simpler times, when raw survival was the main goal."
Dinosaur King,[removed]
Dinosaur King,Community
Dinosaur King,"Amphibia! 

You really feel the relationship grow from strangers to surrogate family to just family. 

As a certain character would go on to say, I **love** the Found family trope!"
Dinosaur King,Harry Potter then Supernatural.
Dinosaur King,So Zuko and Iroh count as 'found family'?
Dinosaur King,Sense8 is a perfect example for this thread.
Dinosaur King,"Holy crap, how could I forget *Lord of the Rings*?! Thanks, adding it now."
Dinosaur King,"I was thinking more of Team Avatar, but I suppose Zuko and Iroh could also count?"
Dinosaur King,"Did you literally just list them all by date? Because I don't think that's the order you need to watch them in.

For example, the cross-over Supergirl/Flash episode actually needs to be watched in the middle of The Flash episode that comes after it. I don't know about Arrow/Flash (I don't watch Arrow)"
Dinosaur King,"[This](http://dctv.herokuapp.com/#arrow) is a more plot-accurate list that includes Arrow and The Flash -- as well as the tie-in comics for both series -- Constantine, Legends of Tomorrow, and the Supergirl crossover with the Flash."
Dinosaur King,"the cross overs and continuity are not serious enough for this much effort in watching these shows. legends of tomorrow is really bad and can be written off once the characters move from arrow/flash to it. constantine show started out rough, but got pretty good in the end however it has no connection to the rest flash/arrow universe until after it was canceled and the character was used for a single arrow episode, and referenced in like 1 or 2 more. watching the constantine show has no real effect on that though.

other than like 2 episodes, constantine can just be watched whenever, legends of tomorrow can be skipped unless you hate yourself, a single supergirl episode crossover with barry kinda throws a wrench in continuity because it aired on mondays and flash on tuesday except the events of the crossover were from after the events of the flash episode the next night. a similar issue happened on arrow with the graveyard scene being in a weird place timeline wise.

other than that you should just watch the shows whenever you want, sometimes there are dialogue references to things but not enough to really screw you up"
Dinosaur King,Just in case anyone wants a watch order to marathon it all.
Dinosaur King,"It also doesn't help that the second half of the current seasons of Flash and Arrow fell out of sync. Because of that, you'd have things like Barry showing up at the cemetery on Arrow, even though on The Flash he had already lost his powers, and the scene takes place a few weeks before the power loss. 

It's also completely unnecessary to watch Constantine, and pretty much all of Supergirl. "
Dinosaur King,Not even the Flash epsiode after either. It was a couple of episodes later I believe 
Dinosaur King,"Yeah, that cemetary thing was weird"
Dora the Explorer,"Two different series

a CG animated series for young kids

a live action series based on the live action movie aimed at tweens"
Dora the Explorer,"Caillou by far.

How is this even a question?"
Dora the Explorer,"Caillou is way worse, because it’s so much more annoying. Dora is perfectly fine for the target demographic and if your kid insists on watching it, you’ll totally be able to tolerate it."
Dora the Explorer,"At least Dora has some self-independence and is smart enough to bring a map while exploring. Definitely a child safety law violation, though. CPS must not exist in Dora’s world.

Caillou on the other hand, so clingy and complains all the time. I’d be counting down the days til he turns 18 and I could kick him out of the house."
Dora the Explorer,"In both cases changes in behavior were reported. In the case of dora the worst that happened was that several parents reported that their preschool aged children started yelling all the time when they wanted to be heard and forgot how to speak in a normal tone, whereas cailou is far worse kids who were once well behaved regressed and started throwing tantrums over just about everything."
Dora the Explorer,I always enjoyed Caillou. Dora is extremely boring and slow.
Dora the Explorer,"As much as we hate both of them, Dora’s flawed design is not completely worthless it caters to a demographic of toddlers with short attention spans nick deliberately designed it this way because they needed a way to prevent losing the group of viewers who can become impatient and walk off pretty quickly. Caillou on the other hand has no demographic in mind, it is based off a series of books pbs has a common theme of seeking to make money by creating a tv show adaptation of children’s books, curious George, Arthur, and Clifford were each successful they are well done, teach important lessons, are great to watch in general, and have gained a loyal fanbase. Caillou on the other hand is one of the examples where creating a tv show out of a book failed by PBS Kids, it serves no purpose and is a waste of resources that could have been invested in creating quality children’s programming."
Dora the Explorer,caillou is the worst because he  whines alot
Dora the Explorer,"Dora is always just trying to help.

No-brainer."
Dora the Explorer,Which seasons of Dora
Dora the Explorer,*Dora the Explorer*
Dora the Explorer,Dora had a map to show the path.
Dora the Explorer,I'd have to go with Game of Thrones
Dora the Explorer,GOT had better production values. Never much cared for flash animation.
Dora the Explorer,"Seasons 6-8, but especially 8, are all terrible so Dora wins hands down."
Dora the Explorer,Swiper didn’t suddenly stop swiping in the final episodes.
Dora the Explorer,"6 had my favorite finale, Winds of Winter, so I can forgive its shortcomings. It was a hell of a lot better than 7-8..."
Dora the Explorer,This was fantastic. Wonder what Muppet Babies would be like all grown up. Oh wait...
Dora the Explorer,"New subscriber, that was fantastic."
Dora the Explorer,and how about Baby Looney Tunes? oh wait...
Dora the Explorer,How'd you forget static shock? 
Dora the Explorer,"Since the majority of reddit are probably the ages that grew up with these shows (like me) People are going say yes because of nostalgia.

I'm sure when the current kids are grown up, they will be posting reddit posts ""The thundermans and Stuck in the middle"" were the best kids sitcoms.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
Dora the Explorer,"The lack of Superman: TAS, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, KaBlam!, and The Angry Beavers is very upsetting."
Dora the Explorer,"These are just things we grew up with and enjoyed. There have been plenty of fantastic shows for kids over the last 15 years. There's also been garbage, and there was also plenty of garbage back then. "
Dora the Explorer,Bobby's World? Ran for seven seasons on Fox Kids. 
Dora the Explorer,"As a child of the 80’s I’m biased. Transformers, GI JOE, MASK, Ghostbusters, He-Man, TMNT, Ducktales, Thundercats, Voltron, and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research. "
Dora the Explorer,Indeed. Was lucky enough to have access in Australia to some of these shows.
Dora the Explorer,"I might extend it a few years to include Avatar: The Last Air Bender, the original Ben 10, and Naruto. 

Outside of that, kid cartoons haven't been entertaining me or popular for kids. I know I'm not a kid, but I'd want shows that I could sit back and at least be entertained by if I am with some younger cousins that they actually know. "
Dora the Explorer,"Yeah, you guys certainly lucked out. When I was growing up Disney cartoons were basically ""you like ducks? Here's some ducks. Did you like those ducks? Here's some other ducks."" Non-Disney stuff was just long toy commercials or mind-fucks like Heathcliff."
Dora the Explorer,"X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman TAS, all at the same time?

Kids will never have it that good again. What song today could ever reach the quality of the X-men intro?"
Dora the Explorer,"Yes it was. Well, in actuality the Golden Age is 1991 - 2003.

There are always going to be outliers that make people assume the real dates are some amalgamation of a 20-something year period but I argue those 12 years were the true golden age because it was a constant influx of quality that was bookended by important events. The forming of Cartoon Network to air the cartoons from the original golden age and Nickelodeon airing their first NickToon; all the way until the corporate crash and burn of the early-to-mid 2000s.

---
Nickelodeon under Warner had been an exclusively kids television channel since 1979; [let's just say it hadn't quite figured things out just yet.] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Nicklogoiozzi79.jpg) They were operating at loss with shows they now pretend don't exist anymore. They hired the guys who made MTV iconic to spruce up the Network, [which they accomplished exceptionally well] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAIX96v1mI) and in 1986 they were sold to Viacom. Under Viacom, Nickelodeon began their rise, first with the original Kid's Choice Awards and then by airing Nick Jr. during school hours. In 1990 they opened the Nickelodeon Studios where they filmed their early sitcoms and game shows and in 1991 Nicktoons began.

Meanwhile, in 1991, Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and created Cartoon Network. The purpose being to air the tape library he had acquired over the years. Along with Hanna-Barbera, he also owned the MGM cartoon library, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts, as well as Popeye.

There was now true competition in the world of kids-exclusive television. Money was being pumped into it and most importantly creators were given the freedom to experiment and tell good/great stories and be silly within of course the guidelines of Standards and Practices. John Kricfalusi would discover this the hard way when his popular masterpiece 'Ren and Stimpy' was cancelled for going too far.

Eight years of near perfection. 

Then within a two year period two cataclysmic events happened. Firstly, in 1999 Spongebob Squarepants happened and it was the most popular cartoon ever made and its merchandise alone became omnipresent. Nickelodeon became oddly complacent and out of touch after this. In 2005 Viacom split into two companies marking a definitive end and you can see it in their release line-up.

The second big cataclysmic event was that in 2001, Turner merged with AOL to become AOL TimeWarner which many consider to be the greatest financial blunder in history. Jamie Kellner headed the company and while it seemed reasonable at the time given he was the guy that made Fox a legitimate fourth network and made WB the who's who of cult classic television. However in 2001, Kellner cancelled everything from WCW to Animaniacs to Batman: TAS in favor of shows he wanted to see. Again, this is the guy who is responsible for The Simpsons, Beverly Hills 90210, Married... with Children, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Charmed and the NFL being on Fox, maybe he knew what he was doing.

In 2003, the AOL TimeWarner experiment had officially crashed and burned. TimeWarner dropped AOL from their name and everything was swept under the carpet. They say that without Turner and his stubbornness (and his finance department working the books) many of his crazy, money losing ideas would have been done away with quickly. Once he was out of the company, that ended up being true. WCW was cancelled immediately. CNN was always sensational but with him gone, [well... yeah] (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Cartoon Network meanwhile... it was never the same and eventually even started airing non-cartoons.

---
In June 2018, AT&T bought out TimeWarner. As of ~~three~~ two days ago, Turner doesn't even exist.

> On March 4, 2019, AT&T began restructuring WarnerMedia. HBO, TNT, TBS and TruTV were combined into a new entity, WarnerMedia Entertainment.

> WarnerMedia's Otter Media and Turner's Turner Classic Movies, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and Boomerang became part of Warner Bros. 

> CNN, HLN, Turner Sports, Bleacher Report and AT&T Regional Sports Networks were consolidated under newly-formed WarnerMedia News & Sports.

There will never be another golden age."
Dora the Explorer,"I dunno. I guess I'm kind of biased being born near the end of that era, but the 2010s had some really good stuff as well, if not, even better. Of course, this is opinion, and you're free to disagree, but we've had:

Adventure Time

Steven Universe

Star Vs the Forces of Evil

Gravity Falls

Over the Garden Wall

Star Wars: The Clone Wars

The Amazing World of Gumball

Not even to mention the adult cartoons Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman.

Sure, there is probably less quantity overall, so you could definitely argue against this era, but quite a lot of these shows are just as good, if not even better than a lot of the shows that you listed.

Again, just my opinion."
Dora the Explorer,"You're wrong, it was (insert decade when I was a kid)."
Dora the Explorer,I downloaded them and my kids love whatever I show em
Dora the Explorer,"Naw-1970's man!

HR Pufnstuf-witchipoo, Sigmund the Sea Monster, Electra Woman & Dyna girl, Dr Shrinker, & my personal favorite Land of the Lost"
Dora the Explorer,"Good times, good times."
Dora the Explorer,"All those were important shows, but in a way Ren & Stimpy seems to be to be slightly more important - because it specifically brought back the Golden Age style of animation from the 1940s and 1950s. 

Among the current generation of animators, John Kricfalusi is a major influence. "
Dora the Explorer,"No because then you're missing out on Dragon Ball, Inspector Gadget, Trap Door, M.A.S.K., The Raccoons and many more that were around in the 80s.

I'd say 1984-2002, personally."
Dora the Explorer,"I think there's been a recent renaissance in serialized children's programming. I honestly would put recent shows like Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and others well over the likes of shows that have come before it, and I have watched pretty much every show on this list (though some moreso than others)."
Dora the Explorer,Every generation thinks what they grew up with were the best.
Dora the Explorer,Nope totally wrong.  The 80's was the best time to be a kid and we had the best shows
Dora the Explorer,Cow and Chicken and Dexter's Lab are to me  the Citizen Kane of cartoons.
Dora the Explorer,"Yes, yes it was"
Dora the Explorer,Go Speed Racer! Go Speed Racer GO!!!! 
Dora the Explorer,"Don't forget CN used to show a lot of classic scifi action cartoons from the 70s and 80s in it's early days. Centurions, Plastic Man, Dyno Mutt, Space ghost, Godzilla&son, Thundarr,  Jonny Quest,  Birdman, HongKong Phoeey, Inch High Private Eye... "
Dora the Explorer,"Pete and Pete, so yes!

By the way, it's not just kids shows.  I don't know if it was 9/11 or what, something just isn't the same anymore."
Dora the Explorer,"Every generation has great cartoons. But the 1990-2005 generation had both quantity and quality. For example, Nick, not counting Nick Jr., these days only has Spongebob and Loud house on their schedule most of the time."
Dora the Explorer,How could you forget Clarissa Explains It All and Alex Mac?
Dora the Explorer,No Darkwing Duck in OP or comments. Fail.
Dora the Explorer,Anything that had Looney Tunes was the best. However I was very partial to the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons when I was a kid (in the 80s & 90s).
Dora the Explorer,Where the fuck is Ren and Stimpy?!
Dora the Explorer,That's a pretty big swath of time though.  
Dora the Explorer,You forgot Freakazoid!
Dora the Explorer,what about TMNT 2003?
Dora the Explorer,"I’d stop it at 2001, but yeah. That era of Cartoon Network is my absolute favourite and it’s really sad to see what it’s turned into."
Dora the Explorer,"Nah, it was the 80s

Quality over quantity 

Transformers, TMNT, Ducktales, Chip'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Super Mario Bros, Garfield and Friends"
Dora the Explorer,Obviously 
Dora the Explorer,"Being in the UK we were lucky and had access to a lot of them through cable TV, and more popular ones shown on regular TV here.

But adding to that list we had Superted, Rupert the Bear, Tintin, Count Duckula and Im sure others would add more greats."
Dora the Explorer,I loved live and kicking!
Dora the Explorer,"I mean I'll agree especially since I was born on 1995 so 2000-2005 was really my golden era. 

But it also feels like cheating to include such a large range the world and tv was a much different place in 2005 than it was in 1990. It feels like when people want to say the '90's rocked but keep naming things from the '00's because by the ""'90's"" they really mean ""My childhood"" which I suspect is what is happening here. Give me the perimeters why 1990 is the beginning of this ""Era"" and why 2005 is the end. It would be way more interesting you had this list and had to make a case of the 1990's vs the 2000's"
Dora the Explorer,Because people were actually creative.
Dora the Explorer,"No

Most of them didnt last more than 2 seasons.


Try looking at the era between 1976-1989,the era before cable TV dominance."
Dora the Explorer,"Most likely. There was more passion and creativity in those days IMHO. Not sure what the content looks like now, but there is the occasional sleeper every now and then. For me it was 1990-2002 for smart entertainment aimed at young people with some added subversive jokes for adults. Spongebob, Pete and Pete, Hey Arnold, Rockos Modern Life, and Gravity Falls come to mind. Most likely there are clever shows that exist now, but that period of time for me and you will always remain very special."
Dora the Explorer,You can stop at 2000 and throw in 1989
Dora the Explorer,I would say the 90s. Nothing past 2000 was any good.
Dora the Explorer,"I would say yes. 06 and 07 had some pretty good ones too though, like :-

Shuriken School


Emperor's New School


George of the Jungle


Team Galaxy
"
Dora the Explorer,Best black super hero
Dora the Explorer,Dope af.
Dora the Explorer,"The question is essentially ""is my nostalgia the best nostalgia?""

Also, intentionally casting a wide net by the range of years and *also* throwing in the reruns is guaranteed to net some strong agreement/karma.

And it's literally just a list of shows to get people to reminisce. There is nothing in the OP that is trying to spark a discussion about *what* may have made those shows great, or how they might be different from shows today.

It's a nostalgia/agreement/karma fishing expedition.

I think I'll unsub..."
Dora the Explorer,Wrong. I see many of todays kids say that the original Teen Titans is better than Teen Titans Go.
Dora the Explorer,"I forgot to put KaBlam! It was a good show, super funny.  Superman on the other hand was okay, it was one of the weakest DCAU shows"
Dora the Explorer,And The Adventures of Gummi Bears
Dora the Explorer,"The '80s were great. I loved watching USA Cartoon Express as a young child. I caught the tail end of that generation of Saturday morning cartoons in the late '80s/early '90s. 

I grew out of cartoons by the early 2000s so I can't really speak for anything after 2002-2003."

Dora the Explorer,"No the 80s was absolutely terrible except for a few late 80s/early 90s shows like DuckTales

Cartoons like GI Joe  and Transformers were basically toy ads and not the good type of toy ads like The Lego Movie"
Dora the Explorer,"Personally I wouldn't. Most of what came out after 2005 was a notable moon jump in quality away from what came out in the 15 years prior.

Now, I enjoyed Ben10 for what it was and it was fine. Avatar: The Last Airbender debuted in 2005 but I'm willing to not count it as it was right on the border. However Avatar is transcendent and the exception. Hell, it might have been the only great kids show to debut in that post-boom era. Not even Legend of Korra was in the same league (thanks Nickelodeon!)

While I have no love for Naruto, it technically debuted in 2002 and is also Japanese. If we want to talk about Japan, you'll looking at 1980 - 1995 for their Golden Age with a few outliers before and after. Personally I'm not a fan of OP using Toonami as an example given that shows like Dragon Ball were in the realms of 20 years old before we got them.

Point stands that yes, 1990 - 2005 is the golden age of kids shows (in the West)."
Dora the Explorer,This is an incredibly informative and interesting reply. Calling it now- it'll be bestof'd within 24 hours.
Dora the Explorer,"I mean I’d argue there was a short “light in the dark” period between 2009-13. Adventure Time was the first in a new generation of innovative cartoons, everything from Gravity Falls to Steven Universe to Regular Show to The Amazing World of Gumball... like these shows are all widely enjoyed and critically acclaimed, so we can’t deny their impact. Though there haven’t been any true heavy-hitters for a while I’d say, apart from a handful since the networks aren’t putting their faith in new cartoons as much, unlike how they were with Adventure Time fever. But you are right, it’s not an overwhelmingly solid period of time like the first “golden age” (which had its real stinkers, but like I said, overwhelmingly solid) and more like a group of intelligent, innovative people got given a chance and a platform for once, and that small number of shows was the product"
Dora the Explorer,"I'm probably op age and I agree with this. I think shows today have more depth and I enjoy them a lot. I would add Hilda, Avatar, Korra, Chowder and Flapjack too. Right now they seem to go for quality over quantity."
Dora the Explorer,from where? I want to download old toons
Dora the Explorer,"Issue is that the three shows you mentioned pretty much capture the entire true renaissance though... and that’s literally 4 years. There’s definitely been an uptake in quality over the last decade and with regards to animation the 10s aren’t exactly something to sneeze at for sure. But the very best came out within the first three years, like a dozen exceptions all at once: which, I know, sounds like an oxymoron but over the rest of the decade I can count maybe five more shows that carry any sort of weight, and those five have either been subject to major scheduling abuse and thus have very few episodes or just haven’t been out for a while and thus have very few episodes, so I just can’t call it a trend. "
Dora the Explorer,Bucky O'Hare. Philleas Fogg. Bananaman. Henry's Cat.
Dora the Explorer,We also got to watch The Raccoons and The Moomins too and The Animals of Farthing Wood on CBBC too.
Dora the Explorer,"1990 is the beggining of this era because this is when cartoons such as The Simpsons, Batman TAS (which are regarded as two of the best cartoons ever made) X-men, etc came out. These shows pushed the boundaries of what a cartoon could be. The animation, writing, direction, and quality improved drastically upon cartoons of previous years.

And i put down 2005 as the end of this era because the cartoon landscape changed drastically in the mid- 2000s. Nickelodeon shows such Rocket Power, CatDog, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Wild Thornberrys all ended in 04-05. The Spongebob Movie also came out in November 2004 and everyone agrees that the best era of Spongebob was everything before the movie. On Cartoon Network shows such as Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo, Samurai Jack, Teen Titans, Justice League all ended in the mid 2000s. Toonami was also moved to one day a week during this time.

Also, by the mid 2000s Fox Kids was defunct and Kids WB was a shell of its former self and on its way out. 

I'm pretty sure this answered your question."
Dora the Explorer,"Okay say what you will about recent cartoons but let’s not pretend that creativity has been the issue for this decade. Gravity Falls, Over the Garden Wall, The Amazing World of Gumball, Regular Show, The Legend of Korra, Hilda, Star vs the Forces of Evil, The Dragon Prince, Steven Universe, OK KO, Wander Over Yonder, Milo Murphy’s Law, Uncle Grandpa, and ***Adventure Time*** for Christ’s sake. The list could go on. Say what you will, but creativity is *not* an issue for those shows. "
Dora the Explorer,And a mix of 1984 & 85
Dora the Explorer,"Ahh yes, the 2000s, known for such unwatchable trash as SpongeBob SquarePants and Avatar the last Airbender."
Dora the Explorer,"While this is true, we're also getting many great kid cartoons too. The Amazing World of Gumball, Gravity Falls, The Legend of Korra, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, and probably more are recent examples of great kid shows. The 90's-early 2000's had their share of stickers too, including awful reboots."
Dora the Explorer,"Well that disproves their whole argument.

Move along, people."
Dora the Explorer,It gave us one of the best video games ever produced - Superman on Nintendo 64.
Dora the Explorer,"i'm guessing: ""and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research"""
Dora the Explorer,Well it worked because those toys were freaking awesome!
Dora the Explorer,Your being brain washed
Dora the Explorer,How'd you find this thread from 3 years ago?
Dora the Explorer,Oh yeah. Raccoons on a Sat morning before Superman then Live amd Kicking.
Dora the Explorer,It's not creavity the artstyle is the same and gets boring after 2000s anyone could realise this happening
Dora the Explorer,Is that when M.A.S.K came out?
Dora the Explorer,Space Adventure Cobra. Best cartoon ever.
Dora the Explorer,Get out. 
Dora the Explorer,Exactly. Not an end all be all list. Loved Inspector Gadget.   
The Vampire Diaries,"Both went downhill, but I got to give it to Vampire Diaries.  Those first 2-3 seasons had plot galore.  People were dying, leaving, investigating, negotiating, tricking, blackmailing, converting, attacking, defending, every single week.  They also weren’t afraid to go quick with major character changes and just deal with the fallout.

Elena’s breakdown when Jeremy dies is awfully familiar to several instances I have had with people around that age.  Yeah it was soapy, but the pathos was there.  I don’t look down on YA or assume that nudity and bad language elevates the material. True Blood was just as soapy at times."
The Vampire Diaries,"True Blood was mostly fun, TVD was like a YA book"
The Vampire Diaries,"True Blood. Mainly cuz nudity, cursing, sex, violence, gore. 

But also because (similar to how the VD world is doing in the new thing about the Salvatore school) the True Blood show went fully campy and nerdy with faries and ware-panthers and just stopped taking it seriously as time went on. It made it even more fun for me. 

I never watched much Buffy but True Blood made me think of that. Campy, weird, interesting but silly. VD sorta tried to stay serious. And serious was kinda, for me, already done well by Anne Rice and her movie...but more so her books."
The Vampire Diaries,TVD and their spin off The Originals Cleared the other show
The Vampire Diaries,"Vampire Diaries stayed better longer and despite being a CW show, attempted real depth from time to time. True Blood quickly turned into Alan Ball masturbating all over his pages."
The Vampire Diaries,"sadly, both went to Fun Trash to Unwatchable Trash by the end of their runs"
The Vampire Diaries,"True Blood. I didn't really like a lot of the main characters in TVD, I only started watching it as I was a fan of Ian Somerhalder. 
 
Buffy/Angel still are at the top of vampire shows, but at the moment I'm a huge fan of IWTV even though it's only been one season so far. Hopefully it stays high in quality."
The Vampire Diaries,True Blood
The Vampire Diaries,Buffy. But True Blood out of the options given.
The Vampire Diaries,Buffy.
The Vampire Diaries,"Easily Trueblood in the beginning.  It started bringing the books to life, smoothing out some rough spots - it was even better than the books; in some places, like the King of Mississippi, they really eclipsed the book. 

But it was like they were so drunk on their success tweaking the story they started to invent new plots and making the story more global.  IMHO, it really got bad at the end.

That said, I'm enthused about a possible True Blood reboot.


And, just me personally, I'd put Buffy over Diaries."
The Vampire Diaries,"It's funny I watched both sort of at the same time. Initially, I stopped watching TVD and preferred True Blood.

Then, around True Blood season 5, the show lost me and I never finished it. I went back to TVD and absolutely loved it. It is a really entertaining show. Some seasons are weak, but at the very least still watchable enough. I really enjoy season 1-6."
The Vampire Diaries,"I liked both shows , but True Blood was my favorite between the 2 . It was  more entertaining in my opinion."
The Vampire Diaries,True blood
The Vampire Diaries,TVD. Just couldn't get into True Blood at all
The Vampire Diaries,TVD was fun when Klaus was on it.  Joseph Morgan stole every single scene he was in.  When he left to do the spin off The Originals I went with him.  TVD went down hill fast after that imo.
The Vampire Diaries,"> True Blood. Mainly cuz nudity, cursing, sex, violence, gore. 

And less teenage angst."
The Vampire Diaries,Oh man IWTV was fantastic. Probably my fave show of 2022
The Vampire Diaries,"Teen angst, in a CW show? Say it ain't so!"
The Vampire Diaries,328 episodes is a pretty healthy run all things considered.
The Vampire Diaries,The first 2 seasons of TVD were genuinely great TV. The writing was good and the actors were giving amazing performances that were far better than that kind of show usually has. But then Julie Plec took over as show-runner and we had to suffer season after season of boring ass originals stories and just bad writing in general.
The Vampire Diaries,"As a long time fan for the past 13 years, it’s just disappointing to see the show go from TVD to whatever the hell Legacies was

TVD even in its “bad” seasons was still entertaining and still had characters you cared about. Even after Nina left, the show still had Caroline, Stefan, Damon and Bonnie. Because it made you care about these characters

In Legacies, they spent three seasons on Landon instead of Hope. You know the actual lead of the show. New fans always get mad when old fans point out how bad the show got but it’s like Landon literally melted into goo after having sex with Hope-did they think that was a high point for the show. We still don’t know how Kaleb or MG turned and we got both Ben and Finch’s backstory before we got theirs. 

I love Hope and Josie but after Kaylee left the show wasn’t worth it to stick around. Hope became a boy obsessed love interest to the point where even Danielle was ready to jump ship and she’s the fucking lead! It’s bad when two main lead actors want to bail in the span of 6 months because I really think if Legacies hadn’t been cancelled Danielle would have bailed because she was done."
The Vampire Diaries,"The Vampire Diaries saga should have wrapped after the Savatores fought it out with the Mikaelsons ( The Originals ). There was no need for another four seasons of Diaries ( Silas, the cure, all of the battles with different witch groups, Stefan, and Damon constantly trading personalities ) , or any of the exponentially worse spin off series."
The Vampire Diaries,Honestly this kinda feels like the end of supernatural teen dramas in general. Are there any else left?
The Vampire Diaries,Hoping they find a way to continue it or sell it on to another streamer. Enjoyed Legacies
The Vampire Diaries,"i feel like now is the perfect time to revive or reboot the universe somewhere else and get back to witches, werewolves, and vampires."
The Vampire Diaries,I want to say I am sad. But 13 years is one helluva long run for a TV series.
The Vampire Diaries,Well maybe they can find something actually good for Danielle rose to star in now. She’s way too pretty for the spin-off of the spin-off nobody watches.
The Vampire Diaries,Nothing dies anymore. They will reboot it in six months.
The Vampire Diaries,I could do twice as many episodes if I was a showrunner.
The Vampire Diaries,I really dont understand why the writer thought it was a good idea to have the main couple separated for a whole season. It was a very weird direction for me.
The Vampire Diaries,Hard to take your rant seriously when you proclaim 2 leads. Hope then Danielle.
The Vampire Diaries,"I always say that if the show ended at the season 3 finale, it would have been great CW show. It's such a great cliffhanger and almost all of storylines were resolved from what I remember."
The Vampire Diaries,Netflix : “*Is that a challenge*”?
The Vampire Diaries,Me too
The Vampire Diaries,"Lol, hopefully she's talented as well I'd hate to be an actress who is only thought of as pretty.

Also she was a young actress leading a show with a built in fan base and pre-established mythology about her character with a young demographic on a young skewing network.

I dont think an actress in her age range could be set up any better to succeed... I'm not saying she's the reason the show didn't work out, but she's the face of the show and it didn't work out."
The Vampire Diaries,Damn why didn’t they hire you instead?
The Vampire Diaries,"Because no one liked the main couple. The show LOST viewers after season 3 because Hope was constantly obsessed over Landon who wasn’t even the real Landon. Landon wasn’t even compelling as a character either. 

It lost even more viewers after Landon melted during sex."
The Vampire Diaries,Please be sarcasm. Danielle is clearly the name of Hope's actress.
The Vampire Diaries,"Actually Shitty writing is the reason the show didn’t work out. The show spent 3 seasons on Landon instead of Hope

I don’t blame Danielle at all. I blame Brett and his shit writing

I’ve genuinely read better Legacies fanfiction then whatever the fuck this was"
The Vampire Diaries,Right? Like Danielle plays Hope and Danielle hated how Hope became. This isn't that hard to figure out
The Vampire Diaries,"Well I won't disagree, someone in that writers room really wanted to make Landon happen. This last season was definitely proof of that, that ferry story line just did not work ever and they just kept doing it."
The Vampire Diaries,"Mmm, what you say?"
The Vampire Diaries,"the only scene I remember from those shows is mischa barton dying, and I can't even remember the music playing."
The Vampire Diaries,Taaaaakkkkeeeeeeee On ME
The Vampire Diaries,"That scene was poorly acted, not legendary - and they played a cover of leanord cohen's hallelujah over it in an attempt to ape how they used a diff version of the song very effectively in the season 1 finale.  So yeah... I will say the 'Champaign Supernova' scene in S2 featuring Seth hanging upside-down in a spiderman mask was iconic."
The Vampire Diaries,"Julie Plec has some unhealthy obsession or fetish for love triangles. It's in just about every show she works on. In Legacies, the spin off of the spin off of TVD, there are love triangles intertwined with other love triangles so much so that they're bigger than every Michaelson sire lines combined.

Also, a lot of people say the writers wrote themselves into a corner in season 3 because of the Originals and sire lines. I kinda agree."
The Vampire Diaries,"I feel the same way. All the characters make me so angry with their constant dumb decisions. I thought the show was amazing in the first two seasons because of the great mix of character development, lore, and action, but then later, it’s just constantly action, twists, turns, and characters making dumb choices. I’m on season 5 but I keep taking long breaks from it occasionally. I hope to finish it one day lol."
The Vampire Diaries,"I remember obsessing over TVD but I was 16 (8 years ago) and I was the target audience. Watched until a character left then I stopped. Years after the finale aired, I tried a rewatch and I couldn’t go through with it. But I remember I loved it because I could relate with the HS drama plus hot vampires. But that’s about it lol"
The Vampire Diaries,"Ah, I know what we need. 46 doppelgängers! Let’s give Stefan one too!"
The Vampire Diaries,Watch more CW show and it won't be.
The Vampire Diaries,"TVD is the best show I've ever watched.❤️🔥

But at the same time, the story was really unsatisfying throughout. By the time they finally solve one issue, another would arise. I thought at the end atleast I could finish it with peace. But u know..hellfire happened 😭. 
There isn't a single episode I haven't cried.

But TVD is engraved in my heart. It's the best show ever with the best people.😍

I am thinking..maybe they could've made an episode with all the characters spend a day without anyone having their humanity switch turned off and no one died.

Then maybe I might be able to live in peace 😌."
The Vampire Diaries,This comment has been overwrit.
The Vampire Diaries,"It's a soap, you have to learn to just go with it and enjoy it more for the moments and characters. I personally think The Originals and Legacies are both superior shows to TVD."
The Vampire Diaries,"Show started to get really repetitive and spinning it's wheels on season 4, dead people got resurrected left and right so the death is meaningless, and pretty much every character is now a vampire, werewolf, ghost, witch, vampire hunter or whatever hybrid."
The Vampire Diaries,"It’s the gift and curse of The CW. The shows will go on forever so if you like them, feel free to get attached. However, the writers also get to stretch the stories out, turn them around and twist them... forever."
The Vampire Diaries,"i have so many problems with that show. i liked the plot sometimes but it usually got so very unrealistic and was such a reach. the way they made stefan have a doppelgänger (multiple) too was like??? and they always killed off huge character development worthy characters and keep their main boring characters. and they made elena so annoying and whiney! and the writers always make it so the bad guys are portrayed as the good guys, example damon is such a bad person and they just say stefan forced it on him or he did it for elena but that doesn’t justify anything? honestly this show just has too many plot holes and it’s so aggravating. i could go on and on"
The Vampire Diaries,"in my opinion elena wasn't so bad in season 1 and in season 2 is when she got annoying but it was in season 3 that not only elena but everyone was becoming terrible characters damon and elena were the worst (again in my opinion) damon became more of a dick , elena character was just plain boring and annoying and always played the victim and don't even get me started on season 4 again it just got worse with the characters"
The Vampire Diaries,CW shows are soap operas. Try some of their superhero tv shows if you try to find something ever worse.
The Vampire Diaries,"I always likened it to Buffy, if Buffy was really poorly written. It's like a Buffy fanfic. Almost every character has an obvious Buffy analogue."
The Vampire Diaries,">The Vampire Diaries is probably the most frustrating show I ever watched

Girls pretty (Kat Graham,	Candice King,  Nina Dobrev,  Claire Holt,  Mia Kirshner etc. etc.); show stupid. I stopped watching after the 4th or 5th season."
The Vampire Diaries,[deleted]
The Vampire Diaries,"I am at the end of Season 3 but I already know that Damon and Elena end up together. This makes 0 sense to me. From what I have seen thus far, Damon & Elena is offbalance type of toxic together and makes no sense. Oddly enough though, I think Rebekah and Damon together make more sense than Damon and Elena. Also, im sorry but I think Stefan may actually be better than Elena and I really hate he doesnt get his happy ending but Damon does. So far, Stefan has made mistakes but Elena acts like Stefan's are so horrible - uhm even on his worst days, Stefan is no where as controlling and vindictive and petty as Damon. Even on his best days Damon does some messed up thing if frustrated and rejected etc. At least Stefan has the ripper excuse. And this may be so random but Bonnie's reaction at Jeremy having kissed ghost Anna is kinda ridiculous. Yes I can understand being upset but it shouldn't have been that prolonged or that upsetting. Even with him just seeing Vicki and Annas ghost she was so mad. Uhm they didnt break up, they DIED. He loved them and they DIED. Is it really that surprising it would mess with their heads?? Also its so irritating that they keep having Stefan say he forced Damon to become a vampire etc. Damon even admitted and several episodes showed that Damon PLANNED on becoming a vampire he had agreed to it with Katherine. Stefan is the one that had no say because he didnt know Katherine was feeding him her blood. Stefan was then going to die until he accidentally hurt his father and couldn't resist the blood. He didnt force Damon either. He tempted him with a woman there but he didnt force him. Damon being so angry with him was so stupid because he planned it with Katherine but Stefan literally had no say. I like Damon at times but I dont like how they make him come off at good now at times already when he literally continues to still do f**k s**t when upset and still doesn't care about putting anyone else in harms way other than Elena and maybe Stefan."
The Vampire Diaries,"I just started watching, but had to stop it was so bad!"
The Vampire Diaries,"I agree with you, on all points. I'm re-watching it now and it's better the second time than the first."
The Vampire Diaries,I had to stop watching TVD once Elena turned into a whore and starting messing with stefans brother
The Vampire Diaries,The vampire diaries books were written before buffy even came out
The Vampire Diaries,"Or Damon, Damon fucked up so much."
The Vampire Diaries,Tf is wrong with you?
The Vampire Diaries,"I haven't read the books, but my understanding is that the show is very different."
The Vampire Diaries,"I finished my rewatch of TVD in lockdown and am currently halfway through TO. I would recommend it as long as you start TVD season 1 with the expectation that the first half does air more on the teen drama / romance side and that it only slowly introduces vampires, witches, werewolves, hybrids and doppelgängers. 

Starting with the second half of season 1, it definitely picks up and there is plenty of supernatural lore. The writing is compelling, there is a surprising amount of character development and it definitely does get more dark / adult oriented as it goes on. One thing that TVD also does extremely well is flashbacks to different time periods. The production value is very high and the music choices are impeccable. They always cleverly tie in to the overall storyline too. 

TO is a spin-off about the original vampire family who are 1000 years old and very powerful. This one is definitely more adult oriented. It's basically a supernatural mafia type show in which vampires, witches and werewolves battle for control of New Orleans."
The Vampire Diaries,"The longer VD goes on the more it becomes purely about the mythology and the complicated backstories of its large cast. 

The Originals is operatic, all about grand emotions and big drama, and much more adult - it does not forget that its main characters are mostly mass murderers with mental problems. 

Legacies is a teen school drama with lots of supernatural shenanigans but it's absolutely more a teen show."
The Vampire Diaries,"Legacies is a lot like Buffy mixed with Harry Potter

It’s about the next gens (Hope, Lizzie and Josie) living in the Salvatore school with their friends.

It’s not as violent as it’s sister shows and it typically does focus on romance but it’s a more consistent/coherent storyline then TVD had turned into."
The Vampire Diaries,"Alright so, here it goes: TVD is a teen fantasy show, and sometimes it does get a little heavy but nothing mind breaking. Most of the characters do end up becoming supernatural at some point, and it plays a huge role. That being said, it really heavily revolves around fighting whoever the supernatural villain of the season is while simultaneously navigating typical teen problems (mostly romance related). And they have to do all this while keeping the existence of the supernatural a secret from the rest of the town.

   The Originals, however, gets a bit grittier. Because now the main characters aren't just teens, they're mostly adults- The originals. The ethics of dark magic and the origins of a lot of stuff gets explored more here.  The villains are also a bit more twisted in my opinion too. And there is more focus on family and factions and how the different groups of NOLA interact (those being vamps, witches, and werewolves). It's mostly a big power struggle between the Mikaelsons, their friends, and all their enemies who are out to get them, and their are a lot high stakes battles that take place. 

Now, as for Legacies, this one is definitely the most childish. It's basically harry potter set in the vampire diaries universe. The characters are all a lot younger, and now the world has expanded from just the main 3 supernatural species to a whole host of them (including SANTA, don't ask me why :/)  Legacies focuses a lot more on romance and the power of friendship, teamwork, etc etc. It doesn't really delve into anything super dark, but there is still some moral conflict so I'll give it that. It's not the best but it has its charms. Overall, I'd say my favorite out of the the 3 is TVD, but I enjoyed all of them to varying degrees. Hope this helps OP"
The Vampire Diaries,"The Vampire Diaries is awesome. Early on it does seem like it's just a high school romance vampire show, but by halfway through the first season it starts to grow up a bit, and soon it's just this wild roller coaster that cares more about its own mythology than about the teen stuff. If you're like me, you'll just find it hilarious for a little while that this one small town has a new small town event every week (the homecoming game! the decades dance!) and that something horrible happens every time, but nobody seems to care and they just keep living their small-town lives. The thing is, you eventually realize that *the show itself* also finds this hilarious. It's all a bit tongue-in-cheek.

And soon enough, the show expands and the high school happenings don't matter anymore, and you find yourself embroiled in this insane supernatural snake pit with crazy twists and turns and admittedly over-the-top plot developments, and they throw in witches and werewolves and hybrids and ghosts and doppelgängers and like... sirens? Satan? It's all in there.

Yes, there is romance, but it ends up being totally not the focus of the show. It is *way* more into its own mythology than the romance. Like... did you watch True Blood? That was a romance show. In comparison, The Vampire Diaries is *not*. (And I think the show proves at the end that ultimately it's a story about two brothers, NOT about drama with the girl stuck between them.)

I haven't watched The Originals yet but from what I have heard it is a further step into operatic, Shakespearean drama, and it's an even better show. I only just finished TVD back in May (I binged it all in a month... fml), so I'm giving the vampires a break for a bit, but I fully intend to watch The Originals eventually."
The Vampire Diaries,"They all aired/air on the CW so expect romance and drama on every show. Try TVD first and see if you like the tone of the show, by the time you end season 1 things get better and better until they're not (like every other tv show that last more than 4 seasons)"
The Vampire Diaries,I definitely consider it a teen drama with slightly pointier teeth than usual.
The Vampire Diaries,"One thing they do well  in general is supernatural lore, especially in TVD season 2-3."
The Vampire Diaries,"I was very into the early seasons of TVD, but never finished the show.  I gave up when Caroline was a news anchor? and there were jumps back and forth in time."
The Vampire Diaries,The first couple seasons were good.  I personally didn't make it pass the first season of The Originals I found the main characters too unlikable.  But be warned the first 10 or so episodes of season 1 weren't that good it does get better afterward.  Sorry talking about Vampire Daries Season 1.
The Vampire Diaries,"TVD is amazing until Nina leaves. Unless you absolutely love Caroline, Enzo, Bonnie and the brothers i would honestly skip to the last two episodes of the series"
The Vampire Diaries,"Pretty much, TVD is still alot more soapy teeny compared to TO though, its hard to rewatch TVD (i dont normally rewatch stuff) but if i were to rewatch one it would be TO, its a great show in every aspect and Klaus kills it. Elijah too. Amazing performances. Song choices are great in all 3 shows though. 

Legacies i wouldnt rec if im being honest the same amount if not more cringe than TVD but still some solid moments the writing is okay/good lack of caroline sucks"
The Vampire Diaries,"I'd also caution OP to lower their expectations for tvd as time goes on. In my opinion, it really dipped in quality after Nina Dobrev left and the finale was pretty awful.


Also, you left out Legacies. (I only bring that up because you seem knowledgeable and that's the only one I haven't seen so I'm curious about your opinion lol)"
The Vampire Diaries,"*Legacies* is also more ""fun"" than the other two. That's why I slightly prefer it."
The Vampire Diaries,"I haven't seen Legacies, not sure if I am going to watch it after I am done with TO. I might have aged out of it to be honest.  

However, I agree and disagree with your opinion of S7 and S8. Yes, S8 was pretty bonkers but the finale offered an appropriate amount of closure for the characters and I have no issues with the ending. I initially stopped watching when the show was still on air after Dobrev left, but now that I had a chance to binge watch everything from beginning to end, I am surprised how much I ended up liking S7. Two of my favourite episodes of the whole series are in that season (SPOILERS Damon's phoenix stone / civil war episode and the one in which Stefan thinks he is in the stone but just body jumped into a human criminal's body  - generally I liked that S7 had a strong focus on the brother's relationship SPOILERS). 

I actually think TVD and TO are better watched in binge sessions rather than weekly. The episodes are fairly short but the writing is very fast paced and there isn't any dull moment. That's especially true for TO, which I am enjoying just as much."
The Vampire Diaries,"It's by no means bad, just not my cup of tea. After the two other shows I expect a couple of murders per episode at least.

When the kids defeated a paramilitary strike time with their sports skills, I knew the show wasn't for me."
The Vampire Diaries,"Tbh, i say hold out on legacies. The first season was really good, i would say it reminded me of buffy. But Plec ruined the second half of season two badly by rewriting it just to fit in a character thats not even staying. I liked the main character at first but she really grew into her op mary sue role, and it has just gotten hard to watch. Hopefully they fix the show in season 3, but i doubt it"
The Vampire Diaries,[deleted]
The Vampire Diaries,This was a very interesting write-up! I love the way teen TV has evolved over the years.
The Vampire Diaries,"Euphoria is worth a watch for the cinematography alone. Without spoiling it, so much of it reminds me of Skins, but on an American budget."
The Vampire Diaries,"great, now i miss evak. :("
The Vampire Diaries,Skam was so great
The Vampire Diaries,"at least the teens lool like teens now - sort of 

used to be mid 20 somethings"
The Vampire Diaries,[deleted]
The Vampire Diaries,A great decade in shitty TV? Alright
The Vampire Diaries,"The vast majority of these don't sound like good viewing for adults. 

And this writer previously used 'high-key' in an article I read, so she doesn't hold much esteem with me."
The Vampire Diaries,"My daughter is obsessef with Skam (and all the different adaptations by country), she even made a Skam collage on her graduation cap when she graduated last summer.

She wants to go in to TV production and her dream is to create something like her own Skam."
The Vampire Diaries,"The remakes are pretty solid as well. I have a special fondness for Skam España; they made Chris (or Cris, as they call her) the main character of season 2 instead of Nora/Noora and made a great season out of it. But I also recommend wtFock (Belgian) and Skam Italia."
The Vampire Diaries,"As someone long whose school years are long behind her (and which featured a lot less drugs and sex), Skam is a really great teenage drama, with actors that actually look like teenagers (for the most part)."
The Vampire Diaries,"Since you mentioned it, *Euphoria* had a very high budget even relative to big-budget American shows. It cost around $11 million/episode, [per Variety](https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/cost-of-tv-scripted-series-rises-1203378894/). The cinematography, the directing, was indeed impressive. So was Zendaya, who's a fucking marvel in this show."
Death Note,Seeing Simpsons character with realistic skin tones makes me feel like I'm watching inter-dimensional cable.
Death Note,It being the same studio that actually animated Death Note got me hyped.
Death Note,I actually remember reading a Simpsons comic that was straight up a Death note parody so it's weird that this is happening again lol
Death Note,I can't wait to see Ned's butt in anime format
Death Note,"I'll take a donut, and EAT IT!"
Death Note,I can finally say The Simpsons is my favorite anime. I thought the day would never come.
Death Note,"This is the most engaged and least wooden or restrained Yeardley Smith has sounded for ages. A few of her line readings actually had me wondering ""is that Grey DeLisle or Tara Strong doing a faux Lisa?"""
Death Note,[Simpsons had a Ghibli tribute in 2014](https://youtu.be/o-EgdALMhXA)
Death Note,The fact Marge has blue hair is like she came straight from an anime already.
Death Note,"It's only worth it if Homer says ""mmmm donut"" while eating a rice ball."
Death Note,"This is either going to be cringey and pathetic or really really good. 

Case a) they show a superficial level of understanding of anime and what makes it tick. 

Case b) they go all out and embrace the medium in all its glory and nonsensical stupidity, like the potato chip scene."
Death Note,Holy shit Marge is actually kinda cute lol
Death Note,[I can’t help but think this fan video sparked this movement](https://youtu.be/1fFuaC71LS0)
Death Note,I didn't know it was changing art style too. Interesting.
Death Note,They intentionally went out of their way to make Marge a Bulma look alike waifu...props to them.
Death Note,Now the real question is…subs or dubs?
Death Note,Seeing Homer somewhat realistic is gonna make his alcoholism and child abuse less enjoyable.
Death Note,The death note version is cool but the article is garbage.
Death Note,I am so fucking ready for this
Death Note,It's a weird one in 2022. Feels like they've missed the window to be relevant by more than decade.
Death Note,South Park did it.
Death Note,Can't wait to see Mr. Burns like this.
Death Note,Bruh what timeline are we even on?
Death Note,Last time I tuned in to Simpsons was the Futurama crossover
Death Note,"Kinda reminds of that treehouse of horror fancomic where bart gets a Death Note, and Lisa becomes an L expy."
Death Note,"Hopefully they can kill the new voice of Carl, he is just awful"
Death Note,"Weird timing, but still kinda cool"
Death Note,Saying the last 25 years of Simpsons has been rubbish is a such a shitty take
Death Note,"It looks like that unlike the Treehouse of Horror comic, Lisa will get the Death Note instead of Bart."
Death Note,This sounds so cool
Death Note,"God, the rule 34 people are going to have a field day with this one."
Death Note,"I love that they're getting experimental in their latest seasons. 

*Well, I don't know how many seasons on this network I have left. I'm gonna get real weird with it.*"
Death Note,"A bit odd, yet not that surprised, that The Simpsons are trying to adapt their own version of Death Note... More than 15 years after the original anime peaked.

(Not to throw shade at DN since it's one of those anime GOATs but a little late to cash in on its popularity, no?)"
Death Note,"""It’s very easy to look back on the last 25 years of The Simpsons and write it off as being rubbish because, well, for the most part it has been exactly that.""

Fucking Kotaku with its constant shitty takes."
Death Note,Urgh
Death Note,There are several ways this can go and I don’t know if I’m ready for any of them
Death Note,woah! i thought the Not IT 1 and 2 was a full Treehouse of Horror just a different format (aired last week). Pleasantly surprised to get more horror-themed stuff!
Death Note,"So cool! And it makes sense, their sister studio already animates some of the in betweens and stuff for the Simpsons. 


Also unrelated but I never read the book so I never put together the Itchy and Scratchy Land episode was heavily referencing Westworld lol."
Death Note,The Simpsons has really gotten its act together since the beginning of last season. I'm really enjoying it.
Death Note,So anime is cool now? I remember when people used to hide it like it was a porn addiction.
Death Note,">kotaku

Sorry, mate, I have self-respect"
Death Note,It looks pretty good ngl
Death Note,r/brandnewsentence
Death Note,But Homie…
Death Note,Homer lookin a little like Tony Soprano.
Death Note,Guess I am gonna watch a Simpsons episode again and not just the Sideshow Bob episodes and who shot Mr burns every few months.
Death Note,So..a new marge Simpsons join’s the lewdverse it was only a matter of time anyone else curious what apu’s wife would look like
Death Note,"Cool they are doing this but what a trash article by a trash author. 

25 years of rubbish? Wtf?"
Death Note,My dad inexplicably watched the Netflix Death Note movie so I wonder if he'll get the reference here.
Death Note,[Archive.ph's link](https://archive.ph/20221026063421/https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-death-note-anime-treehouse-horror-dr-movie-1849702547) so you don't have to award a click.
Death Note,"Thanks, I hate it."
Death Note,And Madhouse is doing it
Death Note,Apparently Homer is modelled on Joe Rogan
Death Note,Two of my favourite animated shows of all time combined? this is awesome.
Death Note, But… why?
Death Note,"Those maniacs! They actually did it! They took the Simpsons and made them into horrible freaks with pink skin, no overbites, and five fingers on each hand!"
Death Note,"Now watch people suddenly be interested in _Death Note..._ and mistakenly stumble into the live action adaptation that was a very early specimen of a director/producer f---ing with canon for personal reasons.  Yikes.

I hope folks figure out that Simpsons is lampooning an anime."
Death Note,That’s an insult to anime
Death Note,Wow they really have run out of ideas.
Death Note,"I have literally never heard of ""Death Note"" I guess I am old haha"
Death Note,God I hope it’s funny
Death Note,South Park did it!
Death Note,South Park did it! South Park did it!
Death Note,South Park did it.
Death Note,I can already hear confused and angry boomers.
Death Note,"Long overdue if you ask me. I mean, nobody asked me so I’ll just tell you: long overdue."
Death Note,The only way the Simpsons could make me interested again...
Death Note,Disco Stu!!! 🕺🏼🌐✨🎶
Death Note,"""South Park did it!"""
Death Note,Only place the Simpsons should go is a coffin
Death Note,There better be a Mr Supakeru cameo
Death Note,"I like the fact that they got the original team that did deathnote to do the animation. But they really could of done a better job story wise. This part was probably better than the crappy babadook and cyborg segments, these two segments were just god terrible in opinion"
Death Note,Stop giving The Simpsons attention we all know its cringe now
Death Note,Prepare for the Pearl clutching.
Death Note,Homer looks way worse than expected
Death Note,Is the Simpsons not Anime already?
Death Note,Death Note was garbage man
Death Note,"Maybe 
r/atetheonion"
Death Note,Oh actually you're mistaken. The Simpsons was a near flawless sitcom that ran from 1989 to 1997.
Death Note,Stop stop the Simpsons are already dead
Death Note,Gross
Death Note,"Simpsons have been bad for the last 20 years, not 25."
Death Note,"Nah, I’m good."
Death Note,I don't care.
Death Note,Any idea when this airs?
Death Note,"If they really try, The Simpsons can still deliver. They just need to refocus their energy toward episodes that have heart and values that everyday people can relate to. For example “Homer losing his job”. Things like that."
Death Note,Homer looks english right there lol
Death Note,This string of words would put a Victorian child into cardiac arrest
Death Note,"I couldn’t see on the article, is it going to be on Disney+ right away?"
Death Note,Okay I’m watching The Simpsons this weekend. Nice.
Death Note,Wat
Death Note,When?
Death Note,The simpsons is still going? Jesus.
Death Note,Sounds like it's going to be a part of this year's Halloween special
Death Note,I hope the Simpsons last 100 years
Death Note,These stills look aces.
Death Note,"Brace yourselves, the hentai is coming..."
Death Note,I guess we will simp the hell out of marge then
Death Note,Very cool
Death Note,This looks amazing and I’m stoked!
Marvels Daredevil,One of the best thing out of this show was Charlie Cox as Daredevil. He was just phenomenal. Sad to see him go. 
Marvels Daredevil,"So are there any marvel shows left on Netflix, or was this the final axe? "
Marvels Daredevil,"This thread is probably the best thing I have read on the issue by Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios: 
https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1069649213498277889?s=20

At some point, it just became too unjustifiably costly to make these shows anymore. "
Marvels Daredevil,">I don’t know how well it does on Netflix or anything like that...

Amazes me that even the creators aren't told ratings. Jesus."
Marvels Daredevil,And my trend of only picking shows to enjoy that will be cancelled continues. Anyone have any favorites to suggest I start watching so they don't make it to next season?
Marvels Daredevil,I’ve experienced this with Spectacular Spider-Man (which ended on a downer) and Wolverine and the X-Men.
Marvels Daredevil,I mean the show didn't really fail
Marvels Daredevil,"Honestly it was really popular, but I wasn't shocked as the the end of season 3 already kind of worked as an ending point for the series. Plus with the Disney streaming service looming in the distance I sort of thought the Marvel shows were in a weird place in terms of that transition as they were Disney owned properties but licensed and produced by Netflix. Overall I'm disappointed but not at all shocked that they kinda cleaned house like this."
Marvels Daredevil,"Netflix needs to focus on comics outside of DC and Marvel. There are tons of great comic stories from Image. I don't see why they don't look elsewhere. You'd assume a smaller company  (compared to the big two) like Image or Dark Horse etc would be easier to keep on board. 

I suppose people could argue they won't have the same familiarity but I mean who knows about Black Lightning or Jessica Jones? Most average TV watchers wouldn't have heard of them before the TV shows. 

Some great Image comics I've read and enjoyed
- Saga 
- Invincible (Being made into a film and animated cartoon so thats already being sorted)
- East of West
- Birthright
- Curse Words 
- Kill or be killed
- Lazarus

Man there are SOOO many good options out there.  "
Marvels Daredevil,I think FX should take the reigns here. *Daredevil* and *The Punisher* are perfect fits for their network.
Marvels Daredevil,I’ll take phrases one should avoid at all costs for 500 Alex
Marvels Daredevil,"Don’t worry mate, it didn’t fail. It was murdered."
Marvels Daredevil,Just because it was cancelled doesn’t mean it failed.
Marvels Daredevil,"I knew this was going to happen when Netflix bought Millarworld comics, they still want a super hero shared universe,  but one they 100% own."
Marvels Daredevil,Man this was the best Marvel show period. What a pity
Marvels Daredevil,"Dear Daredevil writer, you guys made a great show. "
Marvels Daredevil,"It is, it's a highly popular Marvel show backed by Disney. Cancellation on a streaming platform that is soon to be a competitor to the shows parent company's streaming service does not mean its over, especially when they directly said that the character is gonna be in other media. 

Disney is just taking all their toys and going home, they aren't throwing them away."
Marvels Daredevil,That daredevil show will and always stay at the top of my favorite all time marvel shows list. That guy fully embodies who Daredevil is in reality. I thought season 3 with Vincent d’MomsSpaghettNoFrito was amazing. 
Marvels Daredevil,It didn’t fail.  It was cancelled
Marvels Daredevil,"""something isn't beautiful because it lasts"""
Marvels Daredevil,"Huh that's funny, Reddit armchair business analysts told me Marvel execs made Netflix do it. Yet this says otherwise. "
Marvels Daredevil,"I really wish there was more of an outrage, like I know that Iron Fist wasn't that Popular- And the same might have been true for Luke Cage and I definitely expect Daredevil to be knocked down so soon, but I like all of these series 100% more than SHIELD. "
Marvels Daredevil,"I hate the notion that they take it as failure because it got cancelled. I'm sure that's exactly the cloud Netflix wants to put over these shows, but Iron Fist is really the only thing that failed out of these. Defenders and Punisher might've had some issues but they weren't bad. Even then I think all these actors for the most part did their characters great justice, and we got interesting stories that we never thought we'd see with Matt Murdock, Jessica Jones, and Luke Cage in particular. I'm really glad to have seen this Netflix Marvel era happen. As far as I'm concerned the first seasons of Daredevil and Jessica Jones along with season 3 of Daredevil are some of the best stories and character work we've seen in the MCU, period."
Marvels Daredevil,"I agree with her sentiment as well. I figured Jones and Punisher would get the axe after they put out their newest seasons. But I never expected Daredevil to go, especially not after that last AMAZING season. I feel like Disney was behind this since they probably want to be the only ones to produce marvel content on their upcoming platform. I was so looking forward to Bullseye actually taking up the bullseye mantle (especially after that end teaser). Needless to say, I was devastated when I saw the news. While I like the Punisher and Jones shows, I almost don't even care anymore. I mean why bother investing time into something that won't even have an actual ending, only for it to end prematurely."
Marvels Daredevil,It didn’t fail tho.
Marvels Daredevil,The show didn't fail though. Netflix just failed the show. It was the best show on the platform by a large margin.
Marvels Daredevil,"Famous last words.

Also:

>Netflix’s decision to cancel Marvel’s Daredevil was a surprise.

Not really. They were canceling the others, and with the way the last season ended, it was the perfect place to stop.

There's no major loose ends, and the story I'd just open ended enough to allow the character to have more adventures.

I was kind of expecting it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
Marvels Daredevil,"Daredevil S2 is the one to blame. I have to constantly talk to people online and outside to convince them to watch S3 because it’s miles better than S2. They just can’t bother. 

Goddamn hand and ninjas killed this. "
Marvels Daredevil,"If anything Netflix has shown us that there are no ""too big to fail"" shows."
Marvels Daredevil,Is 3 full seasons a failure though? 
Marvels Daredevil,Fuck Disney
Marvels Daredevil,I don't understand how this is a big shock to people.  Did you really think Disney would let Netflix compete with Disney+ by letting Netflix continue to stream Marvel properties?  
Marvels Daredevil,Feels really bad fuck :( 
Marvels Daredevil,Nobody's bigger than The Mouse. 
Marvels Daredevil,"To be fair it didn’t fail, it achieved so much success that Disney grew envious."
Marvels Daredevil,"I get that opinions are subjective, but everyone prerending that season 3 wasn't amazing is straight out lying. "
Marvels Daredevil,"Disney wanted to buy Netflix, Netflix told Disney to piss off. Disney cancelled their contracts with Netflix.

Disney owns MCU

This is Disney pulling licenses as they run out. Expect more shows to end.

The streaming wars are just ramping up, soon you will have to subscribe to many many places just to see the stuff you like or use to watch in one place.
"
Marvels Daredevil,I feel like an entire generation is discovering that sometimes TV shows get canceled.
Marvels Daredevil,"Unpopular opinion, but all the Marvel shows suffered from weak pacing and were not great television, Daredevil being a slight exception. "
Marvels Daredevil,I hope he's aware that the axing does not reflect one bit on the quality of the writing. The writers and the cast/crew delivered an excellent season and they should be really pleased with the work they've done. 
Marvels Daredevil,"It's so sad, I love the Daredevil series.  Saying that, I bet the production costs have to be over the top on these series.  They look and feel like 13 hour long movies with the way they're shot."
Marvels Daredevil,I place a curse on all the powers that be who are responsible for this cancellation. 
Marvels Daredevil,This makes me so sad!
Marvels Daredevil,Don’t worry everyone we still have the runaways and cloak and dagger over on hulu
Marvels Daredevil,"Considering they never actually tied the Netflix shows into the MCU outside of vauge references, it might as well have been a completely separate universe so it's honestly not that surprising. 

Daredevil was good though, wish it actually went somewhere."
Marvels Daredevil,"I was gutted, but it seemed to be the trend Netflix was going towards.  I hope they bring the core three of this show over to MCU.  For the love of god, Charlie is gold, simple gold."
Marvels Daredevil,I dont undetstand why its cancelled... I just don't.
Marvels Daredevil,"It didnt fail, Netflix failed us."
Marvels Daredevil,Nothing is too big to fail.
Marvels Daredevil,"Now I can't hear Vincent D'onofrio yelling 
N A D E E M  again, oh wait."
Marvels Daredevil,"So did I.  After season 3 I was just like ""keep cranking them out."" and after Punisher I was really really hoping for a really dark Moon Knight..."
Marvels Daredevil,guess that works only for banks
Marvels Daredevil,"The reason for the cancellations on Netflix is so Disney can put it on their own streaming service. Either making a new series entirely or continuing it. Garbage idea if you ask me. 


I suppose, that is what one gets when you let the fascists of whimsy run wild~"
Marvels Daredevil,Basically confirming these shows or at least daredevil will be completely rebooted on Disney's platform.
Marvels Daredevil,I was really looking forward to a season 4
Marvels Daredevil,SAME
Marvels Daredevil,In your own mind maybe. It barely registered on the TV scale.
Marvels Daredevil,"Lol, all the people thinking this was Disney's fault

You do realize Disney isn't going to put R rated content on D+ right?"
Marvels Daredevil,“Too big to fail” ...that classic maxim we all know and love and isn’t at all tongue in cheek.
Marvels Daredevil,"The entire Marvel Universe is now a property of Disney. Yes, Netflix could've keep making existing shows, but it would be like giving away free advertisement to Disney. All that money will be much better spent on Netflix own IP, like Altered Carbon etc.

This cancellation is not because Daredevil failed. It is because it been bought out from under Netflix.
"
Marvels Daredevil,"How did they not see this show getting cancelled?  All these shows are getting cancelled because Disney's streaming service starts next year and they are pulling all marvel and star wars from Netflix.  
It's certainly a huge kick in the head for Netflix ""hey thanks for making our shows the most popular thing on your platform but we're talking them back now, suck it."""
Marvels Daredevil,It didn’t fail. Netflix just wanted to bet on something else despite all the winning.
Marvels Daredevil,so did we all.
Marvels Daredevil,"To be fair, name a Netflix show that's gone into 6 or 7th season or beyond. You can't for anything beyond, it hasn't happened. And as far as 7 or 6 it comes down to Orange is The New Black and House of Cards - both will be their final seasons respectively. And I bring that up as a comparable season amount to Arrow. 

The point is, around half their originals in so far have ended. Daredevil going on for 3 seasons is fairly respectable when most Netflix dramas only go on for 1-3 seasons. "
Marvels Daredevil,"No matter how big you are, Disney is probably bigger."
Marvels Daredevil,It didnt fail. I bet you a weeks pay there was a private deal between Netflix and Marvel. Marvel is pulling back as much of their stuff as they can .
Marvels Daredevil,Not sure why anyone thought Netflix would keep Marvel properties for long after Disney announced their own streaming service.
Marvels Daredevil,"Nice enough person and all, but her daredevil episode and what she wrote for Iron Fist season 1-were the worst.  If she was working on Season 4-Im glad to see it cancelled.  Karen Page was the weak points of any episode-I forwarded past her parts in almost every episode.  I think Season 4 would have been the Karen Page story with Cameos by Daredevil every third episode.  Seriously Netflix-learn why people watch the show.  I liked season 3-but we never got to even see the protagonist of his own show suit up.  Hopefully Disney Plus has people who understand the characters and do a better job"
Marvels Daredevil,"Sad thing is, it didn't really fail. "
Marvels Daredevil,"People called me crazy when I thought the IF/LC cancellations were heralding the end of Marvel on Netflix. 

Even I thought DD would get 1 last season to really tie it up though. "
Marvels Daredevil,Such hubris. 
Marvels Daredevil,The makers of lucifer thought that too. Kinda funny how Netflix killed one show who thought it was too big to fail and saved the other 
Marvels Daredevil,"That's what all of these writers/producers/studios think of anything with a comic book name. 

Given time most people will grow tired of these super hero movies. Because when you boil them down, they're all pretty much the same. So when the giant action scenes become yesterday's news, people will stop going. "
Marvels Daredevil,"With Daredevil gone, I'm canceling my Netflix account. Stranger Things S2 was garbage and theres nothing else on that platform I can't get elsewhere. 

If they're gonna cut their nose off to spite their face, give me the blade and I'll just end it all, ya jerks."
Marvels Daredevil,Unpopular opinion: it was boring as fuck
Marvels Daredevil,It didn’t fail...it was sabotaged
Marvels Daredevil,[deleted]
Marvels Daredevil,That 3rd season was fantastic but you are not a damn bank.
Marvels Daredevil,"Daredevil didn't fail.

Netflix failed. "
Marvels Daredevil,I honestly didn’t think it was very good.
Marvels Daredevil,"It is, in theory, but it seems like Disney is eager to quash any competition they can with the advent of their forthcoming streaming app. I think it’s in vein, personally. I think they’re going to put more money into this app than they’ll be able to make back, unless they can fill it with recognizable, desirable titles on day one."
Marvels Daredevil,It did not fucking FAIL!
Marvels Daredevil,"It kind of feels like Netflix is, for the first time, acting like a typical television station (ie. NBC, CBS) and canceling shows that fans adored. It's a shame."
Marvels Daredevil,The problem with the series was that after season one the emotional motifs just kept repeating themselves. 
Marvels Daredevil,This Daredevil wouldn't work in a movie. When he's bare handed he actually has to punch people 150 times before they give up. Black Widow knocks people out with her hair. 
Marvels Daredevil,"This might be unpopular but I think copyright, intellectual property, etc. should all last 10 years at most. It is kind of ridiculous to me that things first created half a century ago aren't basically part of the public commons by now."
Marvels Daredevil,The show didn't fail. Netflix or Disney failed the show.
Marvels Daredevil,"I didn't finish Jessica Jones S1/S2, and Iron Fist S2. Both seem very boring and uninteresting. For some reason I like the DareDevil show much more, and the defenders in general."
Marvels Daredevil,"I don't think it did fail. It was killed for (dons tinfoil hat) ""reasons""."
Marvels Daredevil,It’s amazing that no one realized that Daredevil was a badly written show. There are episodes where I would scrub past  half the content just to get to the shit that was an actually interesting story and moved the plot forward. Especially on Netflix shows there was this feeling that these bland characters with their measly B and C plots that were slow humorless and mundane in execution passed for story because it filled out the impressive run time of the season. There are places where one set of characters are trying to figure out what other set of characters already know and simply recapitulate details understood by the other. None of the threads come together and the drama weighs down a plodding script without any of the airy lightness of humor or the urgency of forwarding the plot. They were too timid and unadventurous to move on or kill their babies and it led to boring TV. 
Marvels Daredevil,[deleted]
Marvels Daredevil,"It was, Tamara. It was.

 But they didn't care."
Marvels Daredevil,"Silly writer,  too big to fail only applies to Wall Street."
Marvels Daredevil,"Greed, my friends."
Marvels Daredevil,I went ahead and removed all the Marvel shows from my Netflix watchlist since they’ll just be cut 
Marvels Daredevil,You thought you were the banking system?
Marvels Daredevil,Are they shutting them down because they’re losing access to marvel material when Disney pulls everything?
Marvels Daredevil,"I really enjoyed daredevil, alot more than Luke cage or Jessica Jones or iron fist. But the punisher is sooo good."
Marvels Daredevil,I went to the panel at NYCC and the crowd was hype af so this cancelation confuses the fuck out of me.... 
Marvels Daredevil,"Daredevil had a phenomenal run, sad it has to end so soon. My biggest disappointment will be missing out on seeing the punisher feud with kingpin after it being teased in Daredevil season 2"
Cunning Single Lady,"yes, i kinda like honest people."
Cunning Single Lady,"I remember a Neil Patrick Harris interview from years ago where he was asked about his old “Doogie Howser” show. The interviewer was kind of goading him into trash talking the show for being lame and a little ridiculous. Harris wasn’t having any of it, because there were a lot of people working on that show that worked hard on costuming, editing, lighting, etc. and did a very good job. He didn’t think it was fair to shit on all the work they did just because the show didn’t age well. I have a lot of respect for that sort of attitude."
Cunning Single Lady,"The Delta Flyers, a Star Trek: Voyager podcast, is a great example of this.  The two hosts are Garrett Wang (Harry Kim) and Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris) and they review and critique each episode.  Wang is the more forgiving of the two, but they'll definitely point out or criticize things (including their own performances at times) that don't work for them in the episode.  McNeill has had a prolific post acting career as a TV director and producer, so his production insights are great as well.

While they seem to have a good grasp on canon from their own show, they definitely have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Trek lore from the other shows/movies."
Cunning Single Lady,"It's always a bit jarring when you're reminded that most actors don't care about their characters and/or the show as much as the more ardent fans do. Like, when fans pick up on a pattern or a subtlety and then you hear the actor talk about not realizing that at all. Or like when some of the Marvel actors did an interview and couldn't answer some of the more basic questions about the lore, and it made me realize that I was spending way too much time/energy trying to understand every little thing."
Cunning Single Lady,"My take is i want them honest to an extent is how I'll say it. If you're proud of the show generally and want to look back and critique both the good and the bad, I love to hear it. Will Friedle said of boy meets world that for them it's like growing up and finding out your parents are full people with positives and negatives, you don't love them any less its just a different relationship. And I like that, it really fits i think.

But if you hated your time on a show, thought it was stupid, hated the writing, hated your character, and you're going to review everything like it's the worst thing ever, keep it mostly to yourself. If something traumatic happened, of course they can talk about it, I dont wanna say they aren't allowed to tell their story. But if the extent is you thought the dumb show you were on is dumb, keep it to yourself and let fans enjoy the dumbness"
Cunning Single Lady,I don't really care about Star Wars stuff at all but I gained respect for John Boyega when he bullied SW nerds on Twitter.
Cunning Single Lady,"It’s childish I know, but I get a little bummed out when actors on “hang out” shows say they don’t care about the show or even don’t like it. A good example is Jason Segal (and Josh Radnor come to think of it) on How I met your mother, both of whom seem a little embarrassed by the show. 

A counter example is Seinfeld— the main cast on that show all seem to be genuinely proud of what they made and think back on it fondly."
Cunning Single Lady,"Oh absolutely. I want to know it all. I think the only podcasts I’ve listened in the past 12 months is from the people who work/have worked on tv shows. 

Which is weird, a few years ago I would not have listened to stuff like that and would rather listen to content that teaches stuff. Now I’m all for it.

Edit: forgot to say, I listen to podcasts of people not involved too. Like I’m fully entertained listening to 3 guys break down a Simpsons episode."
Cunning Single Lady,I’m completely indifferent
Cunning Single Lady,"I dunno. Everyone likes gossip, but that industry seems so ego heavy, I honestly feel bad for actors who are put on the spot to bad mouth something they've worked on knowing those are real doors closing for them."
Cunning Single Lady,"I'm enjoying the Talkville podcast which is Tom Welling & Michael Rosenbaum discussing Smallville. It seems pretty honest, but there's also a lot they seem to have forgotten about making the show, understandably so, it was a while ago that the show aired."
Cunning Single Lady,No not really. I just want to enjoy the magic of movies and TV shows.
Cunning Single Lady,Half of Pod Meets World (the boy meets world podcast) is the 3 actors shitting on some of the decisions the producers and Michael Jacobs made about the show lol.
Cunning Single Lady,"Why would I want it the other way around, honesty is appreciated."
Cunning Single Lady,"Alan Ritchson is known for doing this on podcasts.

I watched a podcast were he talked about how brutal filming for Reacher was, he explained how they underestimated how long filming would take so everything was rushed and the fight scenes were choreographed in between takes then filmed after. How he was so exhausted and injured from the 16+ hours days 7 days a week that he was taking so much ibuprofen that his testosterone tanked which made him even more exhausted. 

On a different podcast a few years ago he also talked about how badly he got screwed with contracts for the Ninja Turtles movies which resulted in terrible filming conditions for the turtles."
Cunning Single Lady,It's a mistake for an actor to do this because any future producers will naturally wonder if their show will be criticized.  Even the cheesiest show has its fans so why ruin their pleasure?
Cunning Single Lady,"They're actors. Even better actors if we the viewers think they absolutely loved their show/character and it turns out they didn't. I'm sure they're are plenty who hated, loved, were ok with when it came to their shows/roles.  The more they're in, that's what is going to happen. To me it is far worse, when you really like an actor, & that actor is a complete a-hole in real life :) Honestly that is why you should never make someone you really don't know, into some kind of giant/hero. They are people like you & me, with a job to do."
Cunning Single Lady,Does Wang mention how he was a shit actor and basically was saved because he was named sexy in TV Guide or whatever?
Cunning Single Lady,"To be fair it's more the writers/directors/showrunners who you would expect to know that stuff. Plenty of actors don't like watching their own work (I know it'd be a form of torture for me in their position), and when you spend months shooting things out of order, not seeing other people's scenes, not seeing the VFX, months or years going by before it's aired, you can forgive them for forgetting a lot of it"
Cunning Single Lady,"There was a Comic Con GoT panel where GRRM said that some of the actors didn't even read the books and Natalie Dormer rolled her eyes, lol."
Cunning Single Lady,"Yes, for many actors its like the equivalent of being a systems engineer/electrician/plumber/insert profession here. It’s a paycheck and they’ll (most of them, anyway) be professional during their work hours, but then they’re tired and want to do other things. Like Carla recently said hanging out with the rest of the gang in an episode of Scrubs, “can we please talk about something else besides work?”

I try to look closely when watching any show to try to spot sone things, but I just like to watch in a more relaxed way and notice different things naturally without staring at the little picture in the background of a scene briefly shown that’s a little obscured. Sometimes I wonder how these diehard fans do it. 😆

Bless these people, though, who are really dedicated."
Cunning Single Lady,"Well for actors it is a job at the end of the day. Also throughout their career they are in many different TV shows, they aren't going to remember all of it."
Cunning Single Lady,tbt to Paltrow not even knowing she was in Spiderman 😭
Cunning Single Lady,"I agree fully with this. If I like a show but the actor just didn’t like it or didn’t get along with most of their fellow actors or had a lot of creative differences and spoke that way for the majority of time the podcast runs, it wouldn’t be a fun time listening for most of the show’s fans who would rather hear how fun and great it was and at least more honest balance between praise/criticism of a show rather than breaking down how terrible something they took a lot of pleasure from was."
Cunning Single Lady,Some of the game of thrones cast who i never really had much care for really gained my respect when they spoke out as to how shit the last seasons were
Cunning Single Lady,"I appreciate it when creators clap back at obnoxious and rude people on the internet. Simu Liu did something similar when some alt-right grifter types tried to paint Shang-Chi as a box office bomb, only for it to do quite well. And I think his [responses](https://i.redd.it/7jp7cu8wjyl71.jpg) were [appropriate.](https://i.redd.it/rlsnr8gsi0m71.jpg)"
Cunning Single Lady,">A counter example is Seinfeld— the main cast on that show all seem to be genuinely proud of what they made and think back on it fondly. 

Could point to the quality of the show to explain the difference, but iirc the cast on Seinfeld had a lot more influence on the production than modern prime time sitcoms; easier to stand by something you had a hand in, Segel is more like that with Forgetting Sarah Marshall iirc"
Cunning Single Lady,"What do you mean by “put on the spot”? It’s the actors’ choice if they host a podcast/YouTube channel/blog to interact with fans and talk about a show they spent a lot of time and energy on. If they are very generous with their praise, honest with criticism or just very balanced in their views, they’re willingly sharing these views.

In interviews I definitely get your point, but this post is specifically about podcasts hosted/co-hosted by these actors."
Cunning Single Lady,"I guess there are some fans out there who if an actor faked enthusiasm for something well enough those fans would never notice whether these actors hosting this podcast are just praising their show nonstop out of a sense of obligation (bias) or they really mean it from their heart.

For example, let’s say on the Fake Doctors, Real Friends podcast, if Braff and Faison didn’t like an episode they were recapping and talking about but instead of saying that and explaining why on the show they just pretended to like it and every single episode and minute ever of Scrubs because they were loyal to the show/producers/network for all their hard work and loyalty to them and gave each bad/only decent episode the benefit of the doubt/overlooked it’s flaws and pretended these episodes were all flawless, it could come across as dishonest if enough fans pick up on it.

My point is, as a fan of a certain show, would you prefer the actors hosting this show talking about it (especially reviewing episode-by-episode) were essentially drooling over it and nonstop praise even if they don’t really believe it but believing this is what the fans want celebrating this show you like, or would you want them to criticize episodes that were of lesser quality and be impartial even if that means there are some harsh words spoken occasionally about a show you like?"
Cunning Single Lady,It was him or Kess. Kess' storyline had dried up. Limited lifespans will do that.
Cunning Single Lady,"I think Kit is the only one from the major actors who has read the books.

Really incredible how people like Liam Cunningham (Davos) and Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) absolutely nailed their characters despite never having read the books.

Stephen Dillane (Stannis) absolutely hated the show yet was a literally perfect casting choice. I think this speaks volumes about how acting chops are more important than being a fan of the source material."
Cunning Single Lady,"I would be surprised if most of the actors have at least flipped through a few pages but I don't blame them for not reading the whole thing through, the books are good but a bit dense and hard to digest IMO, I switched to the audiobooks and enjoyed that immensely more."
Cunning Single Lady,"she has like two lines in it, they probably didn't even tell her the context or what it was for while shooting."
Cunning Single Lady,I also gained some respect for that guy from Twilight after seeing him talk about how bad he thought the book/script was.
Cunning Single Lady,[deleted]
Cunning Single Lady,I mean jerry did but the other three were just actors as far as I know
Cunning Single Lady,"Ah, my bad.  I didn't read closely enough and missed the hosted by part."
Cunning Single Lady,She was a way more interesting character
Cunning Single Lady,"To be fair, hating literally everything around him was super on brand for Stannis."
Cunning Single Lady,">I think Kit is the only one from the major actors who has read the books.

Gwendoline, but she seems that way inclined for everything."
Cunning Single Lady,Do you know why he hated the show? He was a pretty prominent character and on it for a good long while.
Cunning Single Lady,Pretty sure Masie read them aswell.
Cunning Single Lady,As I understand the industry a bit better I dont blame her for that
Cunning Single Lady,"The rest of the cast spoke out against it via morse code, if you check their blinking."
Cunning Single Lady,"Not saying they were writing their own lines or anything, but remember Michael Richards and Jason Alexander being able to sort of make the character their own; had a little more freedom and ""ownership"" of their character

Meanwhile my understanding of modern network sitcom productions are the actors mostly just show up, read their lines, and go home (bc even in a long running sitcom, you can be replaced, see Roseanne)"
Cunning Single Lady,"he also didnt understand the show at all

so he was basically stannis and doing his duty"
Cunning Single Lady,[removed]
Cunning Single Lady,I think he didn't so much hate the show as the experience of working in it.
Cunning Single Lady,I think Ian McElhinney is a fan of them as well.
Cunning Single Lady,"He's just one of those old hats who's not a fan of fantasy. Probably thought the show was nonsense. Liam Cunningham mentions that Stephen would constantly ask him what was happening in a scene (lol).

Pretty insane to think just how perfect a Stannis he was. He was just in it for the paycheck :)"
Cunning Single Lady,"He didn't hate it. Just didn't ""get it."" He never badmouths it directly.

I think for him it just wasn't a very interesting experience. With a huge production like this, in multiple countries, you don't necessarily get a great work environment. His character barely interacted with the majority of the cast, I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't even meet a bunch of them."
Cunning Single Lady,"For the greater good. If he believes the religious nonsense Mel is feeding him and was desperate enough, then it makes sense he would burn Shireen. I'd assume he'd appoint another heir, unless he was convinced he was covered in plot armour or something.

It's been a while since I've read the books and I've never liked Stannis, so I may be wildly off about what makes sense for Stannis to do."
Cunning Single Lady,"yes, that's right. There's a few. More haven't than have."
Cunning Single Lady,"Yeah, he talked about how he was excited for a bigger role coming up.

Oops."
Cunning Single Lady,"I also haven't read them in ages, but I never got the impression that Stannis believed any of it, and he was just using them."
Cunning Single Lady,">  so how the fuck does he get on that flight every single time!? Have you tried stabbing him!? Poisoning him!?

Surely if she wants him to die she can just let him get on the plane?"
Cunning Single Lady,Monotonous and boring… it is a German series… have you seen our daily news? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Cunning Single Lady,lol c'mon u kno exactly what i mean.
Cunning Single Lady,😂😂
Cunning Single Lady,"If Dr. Bruce Banner could not rebuild a Hulk inhibitor for himself *or Jen* in Episode 1, how did the court build a Hulk inhibitor for her in Episode 9?"
Cunning Single Lady,Demand better from your entertainment media.
Cunning Single Lady,"ahh, ye olde ""i know its not breaking bad"" post

classic"
Cunning Single Lady,"I agree with every point. The fact that the show directly integrated that into the story shows that they knew exactly what they were doing. 

I saw one post where someone said they were disappointed by the last episode because they actually wanted that big fight scene. It’s like some people missed the point even when it was spelled out for them."
Cunning Single Lady,The reason this show gets so much hate is because of people like you trying to convince others that it’s secretly good and all the criticism is fake outrage. Then the trolls get under your skin enough to the point that you make a post like this. It’s a never ending cycle.
Cunning Single Lady,"i liked loki, fully stopped with the MCU there, it was too much.

you cant keep eating the same dish every day and not get bored, even if u like it."
Cunning Single Lady,"I recommend talking to people in real life that aren't angry men. You'll find that discussing She-Hulk, and frankly *everything*, becomes much more enjoyable."
Cunning Single Lady,"It’s literally the only good Marvel show and the only genuinely funny Marvel comedy. 

A low stakes, half hour silly rom com sitcom without the baggage of continuity or setting up the next big bad. It’s like Sex and the City with a giant green lawyer or Ally McBeal with superheroes.

What’s not to like?"
Cunning Single Lady,"Yeah, I liked it too.  I wasn't looking for the Next Great Thing and don't demand it of my casual entertainment, but the story arc was fun, although I could have done entirely without her annoying sidekick pal and the appearance by Megan.  They really added nothing.  But overall, I enjoyed the fun show being fun."
Cunning Single Lady,"The Youtube reviewers did get a lot of mileage out of She Hulk, but some of their criticisms were legitimate.  The point of She Hulk seemed to be to tell Marvel's fans to sod off.  Marvel should not be surprised when they do."
Cunning Single Lady,I like to think the court-mandated inhibitors were useless the entire time.
Cunning Single Lady,"I mean, should i even need to say it?

One is a grounded and serious drama and the other is a goofy, self-aware fourth wall breaking sitcom.

People are acting like this was Game of Thrones (a serious show) turning to shit in his last seasons, but no, this was just a show that was true to itself from the start and during its entirety of 9 episodes.

It's okay to dislike it and criticize it, hell, i'm not even saying that i am right for saying that it's enjoyable, but the amount and type of outrage that this show got was insane given the nature of the show.

Some people took way to seriously, a show that never took itself serious and it shows by the way their criticism was made."
Cunning Single Lady,">that they knew exactly what they were doing. 

If that's true, then I'm trying my earnest to imagine the pitch they made for this show: ""... The villians will be A, B, and C, and meanwhile there's X, Y, and Z happening... then at the finale she's gonna talk to Marvel Studios and she will literally erase all the A to Z (literal no payoff because haha it's a comedy series)....  It's not lazy writing, it's Subverted Expectations™!"""
Cunning Single Lady,"Now, whether the execution of it was good or not is debatable, but it's the sheer fact of all of this forced fake outrage over such a self-aware troll type of show that gets me haha

It's comepletely fair and fine to dislike the final product, but the way people went about it, showed how unhinged some of this ""criticism"" was."
Cunning Single Lady,"I didn't try to convice myseld that it was secretly good, i just enjoy it and find it funny.

You clearly didn't read the post."
Cunning Single Lady,"If a show gets hate because of its fans then the haters are fucking stupid. If you're gonna hate a show, at least hate it for what it is not for having annoying fans lmao."
Cunning Single Lady,">you cant keep eating the same dish every day and not get bored, even if u like

As an old, this statement is unrelatable to me. We used to watch the same show for 24 episodes a year, for 8 years, without getting sick of them. There's A LOT more variety between Marvel shows than there ever was between House episodes in the same season."
Cunning Single Lady,Hawkeye was completely different and very grounded street level. This show is different than anything else in the entire MCU. Ms. Marvel is basically YA. Moon Knight is very dark and at times horror. None of them were the same dish.
Cunning Single Lady,"True.

I decided to just pick and choose whatever i watch (Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, Love and Thunder were the ones i skipped and i will skip many more).

I don't even care about intercontinuity of the universe (i'll watch a 3 minute recap if i want too), but trying to watch all of these shows/movies is mostly a chore/homework than actual enjoyment, so i would rather watch something that i actually like."
Cunning Single Lady,was there a character arc in she-hulk (the season) and what and whose was it? tia
Cunning Single Lady,"If you really want to distill it, the only purpose of the season was to:

- introduce Jennifer Walters and provide her an origin story
- reintroduce Abomination for future use
- introduce “Hulk blood” and Hulk’s son

Everything else was secondary to that. It was the same thing with Ms. Marvel:

- introduce a new character
- introduce a government agency tracking down superpowered individuals 
- introduce ClanDestine

I’m not saying whether that’s the best decision or not, but it seems to me that these two shows only existed to introduce a new character and do some world building, which sets the MCU status quo going forward. What they didn’t do was add any stakes."
Cunning Single Lady,"yeah, but i wont put these marvel shows on the same place people put shows like the wire, even shows like TWD at its prime were good enough to have those episodes.

as for sitcoms, i think thats a different thing."
Cunning Single Lady,"> Moon Knight is very dark and at times horror.

Lmao, you can't be serious. This is what Marvel said it would be, but it's absolutely nothing like that."
Cunning Single Lady,"I don't know if grounded is the right word after we saw Hawkeye's arrows.

They went full goofy and over the top on that one."
Cunning Single Lady,TWD fell out of its prime after season 1
Cunning Single Lady,"yeah and GOT was only good for 3 episodes of the first season, i know.

now plz, stop."
Cunning Single Lady,"I couldn't get into GoT, quit after s1"
Cunning Single Lady,"I enjoyed your review, and agree with several issues that you mention."
Cunning Single Lady,It's really stupid to see your post get downvoted just because some people take this shit way too personally. You thoroughly and respectfully explained your perspective in a way that doesn't demean people who actually enjoyed it. I'm a huge Tolkien fan and I appreciate you sharing your point of view.

Cunning Single Lady,"I'll admit I haven'y seen most of these, but I 100% agree with your assessments on the ones I *have* seen. Severance was like a breath of fresh air! Unique, evocative, and humanist. It asks and answers the question: what if we had the ability to manage our pain in a completely nihilistic way? Who would do it and why? The characters, the acting, the symbolisms of the color schemes, the mystery, the horror...Ben Stiller is soooo good behind the camera. And if you like his sensibilities here, check out Escape from Danemora, a biopic abt the woman who helped 2 men escape a high security prison. Also with Patricia Arquette. Ben Stiller directed. This show is one of my top 5 favs this year. 

I usually LOVE shows like From. Unfortunately, it was lacking everything you mentioned. It made a really good premise feel trite and boring :/. 

A show you didn't mention but deserves to be here is Physical on AppleTV. Omg SO GOOD. Rose Byrne (love her!) is a woman with severe eating disorder (tw) who falls into 80s aerobics stardom. It's funny, it's sad, it's entertaining, and if you are someone who has had intrusive thoughts abt your physical appearance and laments what your past decisions have cost you in your life while trying to improve your current situation, this show will speak to you.

Peacemaker is HILARIOUS and surprising. Also in my top 5 this year. Pam and Tommy was good, not great, but I was entertained enough to watch it all. Gave me a whole diff perspective on Pam Anderson and left me feeling angry that no one went to jail over the theft!"
Cunning Single Lady,"Don't agree with you on Bang Bang Baby. Thought it was executed magnificently but agree it could have been tighter. It was produced by the same guy who produced My Brilliant Friend and Young Pope. He also produced The King which came out this year. Think you'd love it: https://youtu.be/soami2tlDH4

Pachinko and Severance were great. The Tourist would have been great with a showrunner and writer like Steven Moffat. Could have been the British/ Aussie Fargo. Conversations with Friends was a waste of time. The book is untranslatable to screen but they still went with it. Peacemaker was great and had heart which was super surprising. Can't wait for the next season!"
Cunning Single Lady,"I like ""workin moms"" on Netflix.  Good 30 minute comedy."
Cunning Single Lady,"**THESE WERE OK:**

* Power Book IV: Force (Starz)

For a Power series I will say this Tommy Egan spinoff does do justice to the franchise's most beloved character. The tone is more consistent, the plot is more street-focused unlike the original and other spinoffs which tends to lose themselves in legal and family drama, and the show sets up a good environment for our main character to strive. His funny dialogue is still on point too of course, so is Joseph Sikora's comedic timing. The major downside here is that essentially 'Force' still very much is a Power series, and there's nothing here that you'll feel like you haven't seen before. It also comes with the same flaw as the rest of them, where it seems the plot just predictably goes around in circles, with almost all the side characters either destined for some kind of betrayal, or death.

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Life After Life (BBC Two)

A science-fiction period-drama that follows the story of Ursula Todd, a woman in the first half of the 20th century who experiences an endless cycle of birth, death and rebirth. This premise does sound promising on paper, but the way it plays out is also the downside of watching this series. Don't get me wrong, there are times when this is fascinating, specifically the times where we watch our main character be reborn and take a different trajectory in life as an almost whole new person, as she learns from the mistakes she made in previous lives, but for a lot of its short runtime, the series really knocks you over the head with the concept, as we watch her die and be reborn again and again to the point where it becomes redundant. The visuals has its moments for a low-budget production, and there are moments where the series hits emotional marks, but by the end of it, you might be left wondering ""what exactly was the point of this?""

rating: 6.7 out of 10

* Shining Vale (Starz)

Shining Vale actually starts out pretty interesting, as a 30-minute comedy that mixes horror and psychology in quite a unique way, with witty dialogue that surprisingly never misses. But the issue is as you continue watching, there are way too many cliches here, which makes the core plot very predictable and stale. At least that's how I felt watching another show centered around the life of a writer, even if she's seeing ghosts.

rating: 6.8 out of 10

* Barons (ABC)

It's definitely something you watch more for the vibes as oppose to for the storytelling, and Barons really does capture that 70s hippie/surfer life vibe and aesthetic quite well. An Australian drama centered around surfers with a little bit of everything, from rivalries, to romances, to business, and even crime etc. Barons is mostly an easy-going type of series that pulls out the soap opera-esque moment here and there. Does it work? Well that's up to the type of mood you're in, but at times it may feel like not much is happening here until something crazy and unexpected does. And there are many different locations here as well as the story takes us from Australia, to Indonesia, to the U.S.A. (though obviously entirely filmed in Australia) with lovely beach views and surfing scenes... though at times it does feel like this series may be too ambitious for its own good. The acting is definitely a weak point, and it cause certain scenes to miss there mark, lacking that emotional punch great actors could've given them, but overall I'd say this series is a mixed bag. Enjoyable but flawed.

rating: 7.2 out of 10

* Les 7 vies de Léa (Netflix)

With quite a fun concept to work with, involving both time-traveling and body-swapping (something almost like '17 Again' or 'Freaky Friday' but not exactly), Les 7 vies de Léa is a mostly good show... but with some downsides. The good? It's entertaining, mysterious, quite unpredictable, filled with 90s nostalgia, and sets up explorations of teen mental health. The downsides? It doesn't reach the emotional and sentimental heights it obviously aims for, and that's mainly due to the script not taking time out to let the viewers get to know and connect with the suicidal main character (Lea)... that is, her life and who she was before this whole ordeal, and why she feels the way that she does. We get an in-depth look at a few others characters and their woes, but not with her, which makes the decision she makes at the end not have quite the effect that was intended.

rating: 7.0 out of 10

* Surviving Summer (Netflix)

A fun young-adult drama with some amazingly shot surf scenes (way better than the ones in Barons), which left me wondering if they used CGI. The acting is definitely a noticeable weak point, but the cast is young. And the premise, a troubled teen being sent away to an exotic location where she'll learn to be a better person, is something we've seen before, but it doesn't hinder this teen-drama filled with surf competitions from being a good enough watch.

Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Nice well-deserved swipe at the Dragon Prince.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Out of curiosity, why? Big Caballeros del Zodiaco fan, I see some resistance to this change I'd be interested in knowing why you think Shun is a worse character to change genders than say Cygnus?"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Nah. Give me Pegasus Fantasy over that crap anyday. Heck I'll take Soldier Dream as well.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,So much this.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"saint seiya is a super successful anime in japan

a dub called knights of the zodiac ran for a season on cartooj netqork and was cancelled for sucking ass"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Yes, it's a classic anime from the 80s."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Are you thinking of Ronin Warriors?
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Anime is mainstream?
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Pretty sure Netflix only has the exclusive streaming rights for this. They had no creative control, just like pretty much all their other anime."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Doubtful the female knight still wore a mask where Shun didn't
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"What agenda? And in the same way, whsts wrong with shun being a girl?"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Are we sure?

Female knights have to wear a facemask and Shun doesn't in the trailer. Maybe they gave boobs to the armor because his constellation is Andromeda (a woman)."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Who cares? What's the agenda that they are pushing? It's a fictional character, it's gender could be Apache attack helicopter, it doesn't matter as long as the writing is good."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Saint Seiya is really successful in Japan, Europe and Latin America. Apparently the US dub was extremely bad. "
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"it's a fighting anime that was HEAVILY censored, even in comparison to shows like DBZ that were currently airing. 

""edits made to this dub included cutting overly violent scenes, adding in previously non-existent digital scene transitions, coloring all instances of blood blue and renaming it ""magical energies,"" rewriting the scripts, renaming several characters, and replacing the opening theme, ending theme, background music, and sound effects.""

It also was kind of hard to market, and they didn't do so well. They sold it as a big epic show and while it does become that, the first season is mostly about grappling fights in a tournament between the main characters. Between that and how cleaned up it was, the young audience turned back to the 100 other animes airing and the older audience laughed at it. "
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"It seems that you're talking about the first American dub made by DiC which was censored a lot.

It did get an uncut version by ADV which is a lot more faithful to the Japanese script. It still wasn't as successful."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I don't think this is even a Japanese production. The original Saint Seiya was Japanese, but this reboot/reimagining looks super western to me."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Then why don't they create an actual anime instead of a western 3-D animated series? Other than being based on a Japanese property, there's next to nothing aesthetically Japanese about this. "
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I think this is a short sighted attitude to take. Shuns gender is not pivotal to the character, whether Andromeda is a man or a woman makes no difference as long as the show is good.

Edit: folks it is your right to down vote, all I respectfully ask is if you do down vote to articulate your reasoning, thanks!"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"First, it’s easy in the way it play with the cliché : the guy has a pink armor representing a girl, he look/act like a girl, so let’s make him a girl. I was around 8 years old at the french release of St Seiya and that what I, as many if I remember correctly, though then.

Second, Shun, he’s actually the only of the five bronze Saint that goes away from that ""man must be tough"" male model but still manage to be a strong Saint in the end.

Third, what it’s gonna looks like the numerous time Ikki come to the rescue of Shun. The girl can’t defend herself and need the big strong man?

I’m all for inclusiveness but that have to be done sensibly wich doesn’t seems to have been the case here. The guy that looked like a girl became a girl and now, that girl will be see first as more weak and in need of a man.

Personally, I think Cygnus would have been a great choice, that would have made a strong female saint equal to the other with little change.

Ikki would have worked too and here, with Shun, you actually would have reversed the girl need a man thing and had Shun saved by his big sister. You could also change the two brothers, that would balance a lot a thing (my point 3 would not exist and point 1 would be minor).

Shiryu, with his Shunrei love story, that would have been more complicated but that could work.

Seiya, I wouldn’t have minded but too controversial."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,At first I was but i do remember this one two because of the armor power up being the gold pegasus armor well Ronin main up grade was white armor
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Compared to what it was a decade ago? Yeah. I said ""despite the fact that it has gone *so* mainstream."" That's a relative statement comparing its mainstream appeal now to what it had in the past."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Because in the original Shun was written as a bishonen. Some of his interaction with other characters is based on that trope. It won't work as well if he become a she. It's like changing Sasuke into a woman or Sakura into a man (in Naruto).
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Normally it wouldn't matter but shun in particular, it's a big fuck up for both sides"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,It's not that they haven't created actual anime. There is Devilman Crybaby and B The Beginning. 
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I disagree.

Now they have a bunch of gungho male saints and, oh what a coincidence, one female saint who is the opposite of the other main protagonists. Shun's gentleness/kindness/etc in spite of his gender might now be seen as being because of her gender.

Unless they completely change Shun's character to avoid that stereotype, but then that's as pivotal of a change as it gets.

And by your own logic, why change his gender if it makes no difference as long as the show is good?"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Thanks for your thoughts.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"100% Agree Shiryu or Ikki would have been great as female saints.
"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"That makes absolutely no sense, shuns character doesn't change at all if you change his gender, Sakura and Sasuke do only because of their sexual orientation. 

And saying it ""was written as a bishonen"" is really fucking stupid, then again, there's no point with arguing with people on the level of ""Netflix's agenda"" lol"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Not really, as long as the show is good. If it isn't, then they have bigger problems on their hands."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"They didn't make either of those. B The Beginning is Studio I.G. and Devilman Crybaby is Science Saru. Netflix just writes ""Netflix Original"" if they have the exclusive North American distribution license. It's totally misleading and as false as if Funimation called One Piece their ""original series."""
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I mean, nobody objected when they did it to Pidge."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Because it's a new show, and they are trying to update it. As the writer points out these kind of changes can work very well as it did for Battlestar Galactica. Of course it is up to you as the consumer to decide whether to watch it, but it's pretty silly to complain about any fictional characters gender being changed as long as their gender isn't central to the plot. I think we both agree that the only thing that matters is if it is good, it wouldn't matter at all if they changed every saint into a woman if the show is good, right?"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Bishonen is a staple in manga/anime culture. It's actually a very big deal. The yaoi vibe will be gone without Shun being an androgynous man. 

They can change Seiya or Shiryu gender for all I care. Their character tropes aren't gender specific so it doesn't change much. But Shun must be a bishonen.

Btw, in Sakura and Sasuke gender switch, sexual orientation is not a problem. Sakura must be a woman because her core character is a personification of feminism. She's written for teenage girls to look up to. As such she started like the average teenagers drooling over boys and such but grows into a capable and independent woman.

If Sasuke were to switch gender, his whole dynamic with Naruto or his brother will not work at all and the whole story will fall apart."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I will never understand people who get super invested in a fictional characters race or gender. 
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,[deleted]
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"But of all characters, they change shun?! Like I dont think you understand the implications, they took some who defied gender norm (pacifist, emotional, sensitive and wears pink armor) to someone that would become a stereotype. The only way to prevent the character from becoming a stereotype is to rewrite the character and at that point, it's a completely new character. That affects the plot significantly "
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Because shun was the guy who defied gender norms and changing to a female makes the character a stereotype 
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"No, not the same at all. Bojack is a show that Netflix has the exclusive rights to in its country of origin. They may even have the authority to sell international rights to third parties outside the US. This stands in stark contrast to anime series that are controlled by a different company in their country of origin, and which Netflix has only licensed for north American distribution. "
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I think you are making a lot of assumptions over a show you haven't watched yet. Shun can still defy gender norms as a woman, and you're right it's a new show so the storyline will change. That's fine, if the show is good. Do you agree that's all that matters in the end, that it is good and entertaining?"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,You can't really say that about a character on a show you haven't seen. 
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Not really since basically taking away a beloved character is going to rub people the wrong way
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,It's the equivalent of changing the Tom boy character into a man
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Oh lord, what is that? The animation looks awful."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Yeeeah, I refuse to watch this in any language that isn't Spanish.

Also, why are the Bronze Saints fighting the military?"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Wow.  Graphically it looks pretty damn bad; those dead, dead eyes everywhere.  And the voice acting is pretty bad sounding, too.

I want to give the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were *trying* to make it look ""retro"" or something, but it looks way too far in the wrong direction.  I know the original is kinda a thing for a lot of people, so I'll probably give it a shot, but wow.  This doesn't even look like it compares with the quality of similar Trollhunters/3Below shows."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,That CGI animation is actually great here.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I think about this show often, mostly because it gave us Sebastian Stan.

A couple highlights from the article:

-One of the NBC presidents having virtually no recollection or interest in the show.

-The showrunner learning to never compromise from Bryan Fuller. Because Fuller's methods always make for such smooth productions.

-NBC reusing some of the shows abandoned marketing concepts for... The Cape. Fucking lmao."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I remember liking it.  It was different.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I remember really enjoying this when it came out.  Probably would have been more successful on a streamer if it was released in 2019 instead of 2009.  Network television was not the place for this kind of show.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Ever since i saw the gif of Ian mcshane in Hercules go around I have been thinking of this show. Thinking of it makes me feel like a kid. It’s the last show I remember watching before going to college
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Thanks for sharing. This was a very weird, challenging, wild show I wouldn't mind revisiting. I remember watching and thinking it would never survive, but you had to admire them for taking a big swing."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I liked it but I do remember thinking that the marketing didn’t really match the show.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Everyone (rightly) talks about Ian McShane and Sebastian Stan, but Eamonn Walker, Susanna Thompson, and Dylan Baker were all fantastic too.

The scene where Samuels (Walker) tells Silas (McShane) that he has lost the kingdom is one of my favorite TV moments ever, as is the scene where Silas reveals he knows Jack (Stan) is gay. Both are in the first episode, I think."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"It never actually had a chance. It needed something like 2.5 rating in the 18-49 demo for it to be successful and there was no way in hell it was going to get right out of the gate (and on Sunday nights going up against Fox animated shows). 

By '09 there was simply no way for a broadcast network to launch that sort of big budgeted drama and give it enough time, support and exposure for it grow like AMC, FX or HBO could do for their prestige dramas, and I honestly don't think there ever was time NBC or any other broadcast network could've done it. It took until the final half season of Breaking Bad for it to be a legit hit, Game Of Thrones also took a few seasons to turn into a blockbuster, same with Sons of Anarchy and Mad Men was never a hit in the first place."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Oooh. I can’t wait to read this article. I’ve had so many questions about Kings.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I worked on this show! Haven’t thought about it in years. Ian McShane was a total diva in ADR sessions. I suppose he’s earned the right.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I loved Kings. It deserved better and probably would have done better on another network or service like HBO or something. It was ahead of its time.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"The advertising was so bad! I have the show on DVD and in the commentary, the creators say NBC was really supportive of the biblical angle while they were making it but we're scared to advertise it that way so I remember the ads were like ""from a producer of Heroes"" (which was in season 3 and crashing and burning like nothing else) and a bunch of random imagery of butterflies and flags.

Interestingly, it was one of the more expensive shows made at the time, with a FOUR MILLION per episode budget! (laughably low now, of course.)

By the way, the same writer/director team are working on a Bioshock show"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Wow I'd never heard of this before but what a fascinating premise! A weird mix of mythical bible story palace intrigue and like Succession-type modern political machinations, even now I think this would be a bold new concept for television to run with. On 2009 network tv? Didn't stand a chance. Shame because there is so much potential in this idea."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Where can I watch this??? It doesn’t appear to be on peacock
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I watched it a couple years ago, I really liked it."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Loved this show
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"This reminds me of why Arrested Development didn't work as a single cam network comedy \*AT THAT TIME\*. Then, it changes everything."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Ah, I loved this show. I even own it on DVD. Loved the faux-Shakespearean dialogue. Most of the cast were phenomenal, although the weakest element was David and the Princess' romance storyline. Way too network trope-y. A show like Kings would have been way better received now than on NBC circa 2009. Succession meets Game of Thrones meets the Old Testament? Come on!"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,">on which NBC bet it's prestige future

My recollection is that NBC didn't really bet anything on it, and signaled *very* early on that they'd given up on it.  they did no promo, and cancelled it almost immediately.  If they wanted to have a prestige future they should have alt least tried a little bit."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I could never get into this, even though it has a real cult following. Not as well written as people suggest imo."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Does anyone know if they ever revealed why the character Andrew Cross was exiled?
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I loved this show, but it was really weakened by the lead actor, dude was duller than cardboard. But this is what made me an Ian McShane fan, dude was a FORCE."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"iirc, in Australia this was only shown on free tv at around 1am. So, that sucked. Else I really wanted to check it out."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Loved the show. You don’t hear too much about it these days
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,I genuinely love that show. It's always on my list of shows I wish would've gotten more seasons.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,It was ambitious with its alternate version of history. But I could only watch the pilot.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I think the best quote from the oral history is in the footnotes: ""Jeff Zucker did not respond to a request for comment"" lmao"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,6 seasons and a movie!
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"I remember The Cape.

I remember watching the first episode, realizing it was dumb, and never thinking about it again."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,Sebastian Stan was in The Covenant a couple of years before Kings. Just saying. I know it isn’t everyone’s cup of tea lol.
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"And that’s why it died on network tv. Network is for safe bets (cop shows, lawyer shows, hospital shows) anything outside of those almost always die"
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"Absolutely. If a streamer made this now people would go wild for it.

Such a weird, cool concept to have gotten made at all though.

For folks who haven't seen it - it's a *very* loose rework of the story of the biblical David's rise to kingship, set in a sort of monarchy ruled modern US-esque state. Lots of political manoeuvring and weird omens, with Ian McShane as the current king. Somebody declares war on God and means it very literally."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"There was a handful of shows from 2008-2012 that would have done better in 2022 on a streaming platform.

Stuff like ""Awake"", ""Flashforward"", ""Caprica"", ""Dollhouse"", ""Party Down"", ""Terminator Sarah Connor Chonicles"", ""Pushing Daisies"", and even ""Jericho"" though it was earlier than the rest. I remember shows like ""Shark"" and ""The Event"" too had some buzz but also had concepts better suited for binging on a streaming service."
Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas,"For some reason, I didn't even get the biblical allegory until a few episodes in.

Despite David vs Goliath, I guess I've just heard the name Goliath used in too many things to automatically associate it with the Bible.

Mostly Gargoyles."
Caillou,"Caillou's constant unending whining about everything. At thats what I remember from when my nephew was watching it over the holidays. I couldn't even ve in the same room, lol."
Caillou,"Unpopular opinion.  That show was designed to be relatable to 3/4 year olds.  He gets upset about something, then works it through to some conclusion.  I liked watching it with my daughter when she was small."
Caillou,He's a whiny little shit! That's why. It was banned in our house.
Caillou,Caillou was annoying
Caillou,"It's the whining. 

Plenty of shows have characters with annoying voices, take for example, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, but Caillou takes it to a whole new level."
Caillou,The fact that it encourages children to throw tantrums to get what they want.
Caillou,His little bitch dad can fuck right off also
Caillou,His bald head
Caillou,"It’s in no way worse than Barney and Teletubbies.

My issue with it was that it was on the boring side but not to my kid."
Caillou,He's bald
Caillou,everything but Teletubbies was much worse.. that baby in the sun freaks me out still to this day seeing him
Caillou,"Balamory was way worse, that thing creeped the hell out of me, and I was 22 at the time"
Caillou,Can't be more annoying than bing!
Caillou,He's the prototype One Punch Man
Caillou,No one talks about this but his bald head really is terrible
Caillou,#**WHY**
Caillou,He was dead and buried goddamnit

Caillou,Sometimes dead is bettah.
Caillou,r/FuckCaillou

Caillou,"Oh good, now he'll be terrible in tangible, three dimensional form"
Caillou,Parents and people who work with small children are FUMING right now 😡🤬
Caillou,Lmaooooo
Caillou,Will this show address how tall he actually he is? Cuz y'all know he's 5 ft 11 right? Meaning his folks gotta be 9 feet tall or something
Caillou,As if the bad news of roe v Wade wasn't enough?
Caillou,A show about a four year old made by people who have never met a four year old.
Caillou,"Monsters, leave it buried"
Caillou,"Well, we all know how I feel about this"
Caillou,Willdbrain used to be DIC; I didn't know they were still making things
Caillou,"My boy Caillou!! You're a shit disturber, but I'm here for it"
Caillou,WHY WON'T YOU DIE!!!
Caillou,I guess chemo worked out.
Caillou,"Remember the good times when they announced the were taking Caillou off air and we celebrated en masse?

I look forward to his 2nd and swift cancellation."
Caillou,"Caillou, the best argument for abortion ever made"
Caillou,"I honestly love Caillou, would've never imagined the show to be so universally hated lol"
Caillou,The first animated children's show from Shudder

Caillou,"Oh.
Oh no."
Caillou,"“My death was… greatly exaggerated.”

I thought we killed you ya stupid bastard"
Caillou,"I don't get it. Who actually watched Caillou? I know a lot of parents with kids, and I've never heard anyone say anything even passible about this show. It's not just disliked, it's outright hated. And not just by the parents, but the kids too, even while they're at the age for it."
Caillou,"Great, now he can annoy us in three dimensions"
Caillou,disgusting.
Caillou,No thank you
Caillou,I will not be happy until they reveal that his friend’s dad and his mom had an affair which produced his sister.
Caillou,Please please just dont
Caillou,"Friday, June 24th; a date that will live in infamy."
Caillou,Great! Said No parent ever.
Caillou,"My own son didn't start throwing tantrums until he first watched this horrible, horrible show.  And now they're bringing it \*back\*?"
Caillou,"Shout-out to the best tweet of all time:

Caillou,Woof
Caillou,"Oh great, another dimension for this overgrown testicle to be a total cunt in."
Caillou,"Why does Reddit hate children so much?

The circlejerk over this show is embarrassing.

He literally learns his lesson at the end of Every episode."
Caillou,Jesus fuck no! The little cum pet should have been aborted😂
Caillou,He looks like even more of an asshole!!
Caillou,Fuck no
Caillou,No! God no! Nooooooo!
Caillou,NO I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD AND BURIED.
Caillou,"Take the worst thing in the world and make it CGI.

What nightmares caused this decision?"
Caillou,Ick
Caillou,Great now I'm singing the intro song
Caillou,Oh no the dad who sit’s on washing machines returns
Caillou,Hard pass
Caillou,We truly do live in the darkest timeline.
Caillou,"Do we really need another iteration of Caillou?

I mean what can top this [version](https://youtu.be/m6zX7iQnuys)?"
Caillou,Somehow.... Caillou has returned
Caillou,I hate it
Caillou,"Please, no."
Caillou,No one asked for this.
Caillou,"Great, now I can hate that entitled SoB in an additional dimension"
Caillou,Let him die! And then burn the remains. By that I mean get an excavator and plop the dirt with the grave in burning pit of gasoline and poisonous substances so there’s not way of him ever getting rebooted.
Caillou,But I don't WANT to play with Rosie!!
Caillou,Holy sleep paralysis demons!
Caillou,I thought this demon spawn was dead?
Caillou,Cancer kid is at it again…. In 3D
Caillou,The menace has evolved
Caillou,Not even limbo wants the bald bastard.
Caillou,"That show was on forever, there's nowhere else to go with it. Plus it's a show many parents don't let their kids watch. Seems silly to bring it back."
Caillou,This is as terrible as the new Rugrats. Do they want kids to think bad cgi is acceptable?
Caillou,Why do they always gotta bring things back with crap animation?!
Caillou,"We May Live to See Man-Made Horrors Beyond Our Comprehension, in just thought it wouldnt be this!"
Caillou,no
Caillou,Someone played that damn tape recorder in the woodland cabin again. Has anyone seen Bruce Campbell?
Caillou,"They finally realized they f'd up by aging Caillou up ten years. They want to fix it now, by aging him up 30 years."
Caillou,Because abortion is illegal again
Caillou,Send it back to HELL where it belongs!
Caillou,This is exactly what I said out loud as I was clicking on this thread.
Caillou,"Not sure why anyone would be so worked up over this, even if it’s a facetious way. It’s made for children. Who cares?"
Caillou,best YouTube channel
Caillou,Ayuh
Caillou,Right?
Caillou,They better use know how to master blocking all Caillou-related content on their devices and make their kids stick to watching more Bluey instead.
Caillou,"Heck, news on the original Caillou show ending was announced during the U.S. Capitol Insurrection last year."
Caillou,Almost. Wildbrain (formerly DHX) bought DIC a few years back.
Caillou,"Thanks for being brave and admitting it. But you don't find Caillou... Annoying? He's entitled and whines all the time. I mean, that's a realistic aspect of personality that my kids also have but that's the behavior of my kids I dislike the most and thankfully it only lasts for a bit. But with Caillou it feels constant to the point that it feels like the defining characteristic of his is personality.

Maybe you can mention what you like about Caillou so you can help me see his good qualities? :) I am working on my empathy and seeing the good side of people.

Edit: Ah, Caillou had his character changed after early episodes. Viewers complained he was too negative in early episodes and responded too negatively when things didn't go his way. I think my kids started watching from season 1, episode 1 so I prolly only saw early episodes.

>In several earlier episodes, (such as Caillou's Cross Word and Caillou Joins the Circus) the character misbehaves or gets upset when things don't go his way; however by season 4, an older Caillou's personality was redesigned to be less negative in behavior, this is addressed by the colour of his shirt, changing from grey in earlier seasons, and yellow in later episodes.

https://caillou.fandom.com/wiki/Caillou_(character)"
Caillou,"The problem is that a character should annoy other characters not the audience, Caillou annoys the shit out of the audience, thus why so many people hate him. Its like that episode of Fosters with the character that breaks stuff and blames it on the cast, or even Ben from The Walking Dead game. Theres countless characters that are not children that do this too."
Winx Club,Aren’t they supposed to be kids learning magic or something? What is this version? Adults going back to school?
Winx Club,For a gritty remake they literally had W.I.T.C.H right there and they chose the bubbly show?
Winx Club,WHERE IS TECHNA
Winx Club,Why did they replace Flora with a new character?
Winx Club,This solidly looks like one of those Harry Potter fan films. Takes its source material way too serious and looks like its overproduced *for a student film.*
Winx Club,"This disappoints me. 
They could have done sooo much with the light over the top aesthetic of the show and trying to balance it with the mature darker tones. 

This looks like riverdale, Sabrina, or shadowhunters. Low budget and lacking in any charm from a visual/world building perspective.

Also the fact they took out two fan favorite characters especially one who was a POC is upsetting."
Winx Club,"I’m so glad they didn’t whitewash Layla BUT I deadset can’t believe they actually whitewashed Musa & Flora!? how hard is it to find an Asian & +size Latina actress?? also we are in a ‘00s revival right now, I expected cute teen clothes very reminiscent of that era. Not what 30yr old women wear today. Overall looks disappointing"
Winx Club,I can’t believe this show actually whitewashed an Asian character and a Latina character.
Winx Club,Fuck me if this isn't going to be a disaster.
Winx Club,If this wasn't 2020 I would be 100% this was a parody trailer.
Winx Club,"Well, at least teeny bopper music in the trailer is appropriate for the show this time."
Winx Club,"I'm getting sick of every fantasy thing becoming ""dark"""
Winx Club,This looks so much different than the cartoon. They completely ignored the original aesthetic of the cartoon which really made the show and managed to whitewash two POC characters. Really disappointing to see.
Winx Club,"Can't wait for that hipster trash Billiam to talk about this :P But, yeah, this looks bad. Effects look decent-ish, but the actors look way too old."
Winx Club,"""Netflix has cancelled Fate: The Winx Club Saga after one season."""

Winx Club,Really thought this was gonna be some kind of live-action story set in the Fate universe until the trailer started playing.

Winx Club,"W.I.T.C.H is a Disney IP, so if that happens it's Disney+ bound."
Winx Club,The IP they already had a relationship with vs a Disney property? You’re confused?
Winx Club,W.I.T.C.H quite literally would’ve been a perfect Netflix show I cannot believe they chose winx
Winx Club,"Gone, also Flora is gone and replaced with ""Terra"", and whitewashed her in addition to Musa.


They massacred my boy."
Winx Club,"In the original casting call, Flora was listed they only changed her name to Terra once this actress was casted"
Winx Club,"Based on the trailer, it almost feels like the writers are embarrassed that the series is based on winx club. I'm so tired of the grimdark remakes, just make it campy af, goddamnit."
Winx Club,Wasnt there 2 poc? An Asian girl and a latino girl?
Winx Club,Yeah twitter literally shutting all over it for the casting and costume choices. All look terrible.
Winx Club,I'm getting really worried for the Avatar: the Last Airbender adaptation.
Winx Club,"Low budget? You know that from barely 2 minutes of footage. Corny as fuck.   


And no they didn't. Stop listening to twitter. These are two new characters."
Winx Club,"It's pretty disgusting that Studios think just because they half-ass black representation, they can complete ignore other non-white ethnicities."
Winx Club,"Yeah, it's fucked up, what were they thinking,  surely they knew people would be upset about this?"
Winx Club,[deleted]
Winx Club,"Is he trash? Dude looks like such a likable dude. He's also a good example for younger viewers, considering his cancer history."
Winx Club,Because Riverdale.
Winx Club,Winx club was set in college
Winx Club,Disney owns the W.I.T.C.H IP.
Winx Club,The idea that Netflix can just make/put whatever they want on there is nuts lol
Winx Club,"Oh, that adaption was dead the moment the creators left and suggested the reason was that what Netflix was making didn't feel like it was in the spirit of Avatar."
Winx Club,Yeah I stopped caring after the creators left.
Winx Club,">Low budget? You know that from barely 2 minutes of footage.

The hands with fire and lightning look years behind the Umbrella Academy in quality."
Winx Club,">Low budget? You know that from barely 2 minutes of footage.

They couldn't even spring for a single shot with wings."
Winx Club,Shitty characters that literally no one asked for so they could all be white? And a toke black girl.
Winx Club,And whites should only play whites like in The Little Mermaid remake right?
Winx Club,[He calls himself that](https://youtu.be/NQ6Prfawuso).
Winx Club,Hows that related?
Winx Club,"Oh, my bad, youre right"
Winx Club,"You clearly know nothing about the cartoon if you say that Aisha/Layla is a token black character, weirdo."
Winx Club,Oooooh
Winx Club,"Easy to make shows, take an IP turn it darker, add 14+ gratuity sex,  fill it with actors you probably never heard of, and make bank off of dumb teen drama for 30 min of a 45 min episode then some effects and action, and you got a hit that will get canceled way just as it gets good or when its overstayed its welcome and gets good again. See also many CW shows that I have given up on."
Winx Club,They meant in this adaptation she’s a token POC and she is. Flora is meant to be Hispanic and Musa is supposed to be Asian but they whitewashed them.
Winx Club,Lol what’s reading comprehension.
Winx Club,"Something you lack, weirdo."
Winx Club,The other person even corrected you and you don’t get it lmao moron.
Winx Club,You're still an illiterate and fake woke c*nt. You just don't hear that enough in your life and we can tell.
Winx Club,Lmfao ok “we” says the person who no one agrees with and can’t read.
Winx Club,Then they made an awful live action version
Winx Club,I still remember when this first premiered in North America on the Fox Box back in 2004. How time flies.
Winx Club,i don't think a lot of people gave a fuck about this in america.
Winx Club,You mean the live action version that is one of Netflix’s top 10 most viewed TV shows ever and was quickly renewed for a second season?
Winx Club,When has quantity of views ever equalled quality? The Transformers films had amazing views and made like 8 films .... doesn’t mean they were anything better than mediocre.
Winx Club,You can’t quantify art if people liked it it was good.  People liked it.
Winx Club,I thought the first one was a great popcorn flick.  It had lots of great action and dramatic music.
Winx Club,"Looking up reviews, and having watched it myself, you might be in the minority on this one. 

It’s got a lot of negative reviews. And I know I thought it was one of the worst shows I’ve seen in a long while.

Like, even in terms of CW teen fantasy shows it was bad."
Winx Club,"People liked Riverdale, Twillight and Fifty shades of Grey too. Some people just don't know what's good."
Winx Club,"And for the millions of people who watched it and enjoyed it it’s good. Because there’s no correct answer on whether art is good or not it’s ART!  

It’s certainly not one of my favorites. It’s like most CWesque teen supernatural dramas where I can have it on in the background and mostly not pay attention because I know the show will explain the plot like seven times and the big insane soundtrack will let me know what I should be feeling.  But lots and lots of people *love* CWesque teen supernatural dramas. They don’t understand how I can think boring space politics on The Expanse can be enthralling.  Neither of us is wrong for enjoying what we enjoy."
Winx Club,"Boring space politics on the expanse???

Is it possible to use those words in that order in a sentence??"
Winx Club,[deleted]
Winx Club,"Huh. Can’t say this one was even near expected. 

You do you Netflix."
Winx Club,I thought that show was Japanese or American never knew it was Italian.
Winx Club,Can we get a dark gritty reboot?
Winx Club,Totally Spies >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Winx Club,Yes i need this. Will it be in english or italian though?
Winx Club,This show was my greatest guilty pleasure.
Winx Club,"Let’s make an adaptation of Code Lyoko instead. Yes, please? "
Winx Club,"the winx cartoons seem more for pre teenage girls, i wonder if teenagers are interested in this"
Winx Club,I loved W.I.T.C.H. as a kid. Shame it fell victim to the Greg Weisman two season curse
Winx Club,"I used to be so obsessed with W.I.T.C.H as the graphic novel/book series as a kid. It's above and beyond the best Western magical girl show. Adapt that, not Winx Club!"
Winx Club,You should rewatch it. You may be pleasantly surprised :)
Winx Club,"Now I can use, ""We only watch Italian cartoons in my house."" When the parental bragging contests break out."
Winx Club,Now guess where Code Lyoko came from without looking it up.
Winx Club,"Every transformation sequence needs a blood sacrifice.

Edit:

Witches are succubuses.

Men of Red Fountain get their strength by eating human meat."
Winx Club,"I'd like a dark, gritty reboot of Code Lyoko, thanks."
Winx Club,Yes.
Winx Club,"At least both, probably in a lot of languages."
Winx Club,Netflix is probably going to use their nostalgia.
Winx Club,[Oh shit you ain't kidding about that curse](https://imgur.com/STWbeUq).
Winx Club,"Oh Greg Weisman made it? 

I might watch it then"
Winx Club,Greg Weisman is Gabe Newell of tv industry 
Winx Club,I miss Code Lyoko a lot. 
Winx Club,...where? For some reason I feel like it's a European country but that's all I can tell without looking it up...
Winx Club,"France, it was made by moonscoop. "
Winx Club,Indeed. Had a pretty interesting plot for a kids show too.
Winx Club,French. I only remember it because it was so surprising. 
Winx Club,"It has a 7/10 on IMDb and a 78% on rotten tomatoes, surely it has a fan base that likes it."
Winx Club,"I binge watched 4 episodes on a whim the other day. It's perfectly acceptable young adult chosen one fantasy nonsense. Somewhere between PG rated Harry Potter and TV MA rated The Magicians.  Also, I may or may not have a serious crush on the emo mind fairy."
El Senor de los cielos,Wut
El Senor de los cielos,Could in theory be good for AAA but they half ass everything so much and have half assed the Marvel collab stuff  in particular. Disney has practically begging to raise their platform and the best they've done is some 10 minute pre show matches that they barely put on TV.
El Senor de los cielos,I need this so badly
El Senor de los cielos,"First roadside assistance, then car insurance, and now TV shows? I hope I can watch this with my existing AAA membership."
El Senor de los cielos,"I don't get it, it's a reality fight show or a scripted show?"
El Senor de los cielos,Finally we begin the marketing lead up for everyone's most anticipated marvel legend *El Muerto*
El Senor de los cielos,"Fucking hell, am I having a stroke?"
El Senor de los cielos,"aaa is the biggest professional wrestling promotion in mexico, and it appears they are getting a tv/streaming show"
El Senor de los cielos,"If the ""Lucha Underground vibe"" comment is accurate you expect a mix of both. The wrestling would be pretty traditional done in front of a live crowd sort of thing, but the outside the match stuff would appear much more like a scripted tv show likely with fantasy/comic elements for the characters and storylines."
El Senor de los cielos,"They've been filming Marvel matches with Lucha-fied superhero gimmicks for a few years. They introduced a Marvel belt at Triplemania, but there is no telling what the storyline stuff will be like. I'm guessing it'll be Chikara meets Lucha Underground."
El Senor de los cielos,Is it? Now I prefer AAA but I'm pretty sure CMLL is the biggest professional wrestling promotion in Mexico given its existed for 89 years.
El Senor de los cielos,This looks a bit like a G rated Lucha Underground.
El Senor de los cielos,Looks fun. The marvel inspired luchador costumes are pretty decent.
El Senor de los cielos,"AAA has fumbled the bag so badly with the Marvel Lucha Libre stuff that I'm not expecting too much with this, I hope it works out but they've treated it like such an afterthought despite using some of the most famous characters on Earth."
El Senor de los cielos,"I remember being so excited to watch Lucha Underground, but then I saw just how boring the wrestling part of it was. I’ll still check this out but I’m not expecting anything different."
El Senor de los cielos,u/savevideobot
El Senor de los cielos,Is this satire ? I can’t tell lol
El Senor de los cielos,Bruh lucha underground was a GEM. It was either so blatantly fake that it was beyond hilarious or it was them actually smacking the living shit out of each other. Either way it was a spectacle to behold.
El Senor de los cielos,Pretty sure I saw it somewhere described as trying to be Lucha Underground
El Senor de los cielos,How can you find LU boring from a wrestling standpoint?
El Senor de los cielos,I think I find all wrestling boring. Throwing someone to the ropes and doing moves which look weak just isn’t entertaining to me. I would rather watch a wrestling anime like Ultimate Muscle.
El Senor de los cielos,"So then you don't like wrestling. That's ok as it's not for everyone. Lucha Underground had a hybrid comic book/telenovela style of presentation for their vignettes. Since it was taped and had a special studio for the wrestling, the in ring product was heavily edited and could seem a little disjointed at times but the action itself was great"
El Senor de los cielos,it really sounds like a Puccio family copypasta
El Senor de los cielos,"Highly recommended.

The first season stands head and shoulders above most other crime dramas out of Latin America, which might have to do with the quality of its source material. It's very serious, so don't expect an overacted, sentimental melodrama, like most Spanish-language productions.

Great atmosphere, pace, music, cinematography. Acting is fine, the leads are good.

The second season is a valiant attempt at keeping the cast together for more of the same, but doesn't really work as well. I've read a third season is in the works, so maybe it'll get better again, who knows. In any case, the first season is great."
El Senor de los cielos,Yes!!! Finished the first two seasons last week. Loved it. Hoping for a S3.  Lead actor is very good as is the private investigator. Recommended watch for sure
El Senor de los cielos,I Second this.
El Senor de los cielos,How does the second season compare to the first one?
El Senor de los cielos,I still really liked it personally
El Senor de los cielos,One of the most beautiful women in history.

El Senor de los cielos,Guess I'll watch shoot em up again.
El Senor de los cielos,"spectre was so bad but the scene with monica belluci had to be the worst. the segue to their sex was possibly the least realistic and awkward i've ever witnessed on screen. they didn't have a crumb of chemistry and the entire sequence was painfully forced. 

edit: i still love monica bellucci"
El Senor de los cielos,love this one! 
El Senor de los cielos,I'll be sure to not watch this. 
El Senor de los cielos,Hot garbage 
El Senor de los cielos,I have a feeling the feminists will still find a reason to complain 
El Senor de los cielos,"*We are like the dreamer who dreams, and then lives inside the dream.*"
El Senor de los cielos,TIL segue is not spelled segway. 
El Senor de los cielos,K
El Senor de los cielos,Wait why? Seems like it has pretty good talent attached to it?
El Senor de los cielos,"I have a feeling that there is no international conspiracy known as ""the feminists"" and that within any massive movement comprising billions of individuals there will always be folks who define their terms differently and like to move goalposts around. That doesn't make the overall movement any less relevant."
El Senor de los cielos,"Just to put things in perspective, you commented to complain about imaginary hypothetical complaints.

And I'm responding to you, so I'm barely better."
El Senor de los cielos,yup. segway's just the vehicle

El Senor de los cielos,"> The case of ""Aqui no hay quien Viva"" is particularly notable, considering that the series ended in 2006. It should be noted that ""La que se avecina"" and ""El Pueblo"" are also from the same creators of ""Aqui no hay quien viva"" , so we have a pattern here.



Is housing a major problem in Spain?

Both 'La que se avecina' & the reboot series 'Aquí no hay quien viva' deal with housing problems.

[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0922037/):

> Follow the lifes of the residents of a relatively luxurious block, the problems of sharing housing, the housing bubble, and the difficulties of young people to find an apartment."
El Senor de los cielos,It’s interesting to see Queen’s Gambit - great series and impressive staying power! Did it get released at the same time on Netflix in Spain?
El Senor de los cielos,"Yes, especially in major cities like Madrid. I don’t think anywhere in the West is immune."
El Senor de los cielos,"Didn't know there was an English version of this. 


Do they utilize the Tigres del Norte song at all ?"
El Senor de los cielos,I feel like I'm the only one watching this. Really solid show with great plot and characters. Two episodes left!
El Senor de los cielos,It looks good. I never heard of it until right now. Which HBO app? Is it HBO Go?
El Senor de los cielos,It's on HBO go. It was on the main app page when it first premiered but they moved it to the HBO Latino section 
El Senor de los cielos,Are subtitles available? Maybe I'll pay for HBO Go so I can watch it
El Senor de los cielos,Yeah. Subtitles are available on everything on HBO Latino.

El Senor de los cielos,"I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
El Senor de los cielos,"Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
El Senor de los cielos,Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
El Senor de los cielos,"Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
El Senor de los cielos,Never heard of Money Heist
El Senor de los cielos,"Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
El Senor de los cielos,Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
El Senor de los cielos,"Well now I’m intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
El Senor de los cielos,"Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."

El Senor de los cielos,you should look it up on wikipedia
El Senor de los cielos,"reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
El Senor de los cielos,"That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
El Senor de los cielos,"I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
El Senor de los cielos,"Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
El Senor de los cielos,It’s by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it’s great. Ultra realistic
El Senor de los cielos,"I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
El Senor de los cielos,Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
El Senor de los cielos,What movie? There is only the animated series.
El Senor de los cielos,Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
El Senor de los cielos,"Do it, you won’t regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I’ve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can’t compare right now."
El Senor de los cielos,I watched this earlier. Good episode I'm interested to see the husbands reaction to his wife's betrayal. Let the war begin.

El Senor de los cielos,No love for the Mike Flanagan shows?
El Senor de los cielos,"I think Netflix has really become disappointing in recent years. When they first got into original programming, they would develop these really amazing shows that were unlike anything else on television. But ever since they cancelled Sense8, they have started premiering more average programming. 

My favorite Netflix originals:

1. Bojack Horseman: Became one of my all-time favorite shows rather quickly and really revolutionised for me what adult animation can do. 6 almost flawless seasons and I think it should have gone one for 1-2 more seasons.
2. Orange Is The New Black: I am generally a huge fan of shows with female leads, and this was really one groundbreaking and entertaining show. I feel like its impact and popularity is almost forgotten by now, but I think it was one of the shows that really defined what streaming could do. I also think it found a great ending. 
3. Sense8: This was not a perfect show, but a beautiful concept, connecting people from different backgrounds and promoting international friendships, which few shows do. Additionally, it was pretty amazing to actually see a show shoot in all these different locations all over the world.
4. Glow: Again, I really love female-centred shows and this was no exception. Great performances by a great cast all around.
5. Russian Doll: Same as Orange Is The New Black or Bojack Horseman, I think Russian doll really drives home the fact that streaming services like Netflix can tell different stories from traditional outlets.
6. Tuca and Bertie: It died too sun on Netflix, but thank god it was revived on Adult Swim. Different enough from Bojack Horseman to stand on its own, but sharing a lot of the same sensibilities that made Bojack fun.
7. The OA: Again, this is not a perfect show for me, but what I really loved about this show was how different it was from your usual fare and how different the story was told. It felt more like a good book than a TV series, which many streaming series aspire to, but really actually achieve in doing.
8. Dead to Me: This show is not as great as many of the others, but the chemistry of the two leads is iressistible.
9. Stranger Things: A little bit overhyped, but creative.
10. Jessica Jones: My favorite of the Marvel shows. (Actually the only one I watched more than one season of.)"

Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Didn’t even know they were doing something like this. 

It didn’t look too terrible,  even though I strongly disagree with making Shun a girl (I can understand the why but it’s maybe one of the worse character to choose to do so).

Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,If it was really successful in Japan why was the dub considered crappy here? Bad voice work?
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"The anime looks like a video game cut scene...I wonder if there will be Japanese audio available, and if so, if it'll be any good?"

""edits made to this dub included cutting overly violent scenes, adding in previously non-existent digital scene transitions, coloring all instances of blood blue and renaming it ""magical energies,"" rewriting the scripts, renaming several characters, and replacing the opening theme, ending theme, background music, and sound effects.""

It also was kind of hard to market, and they didn't do so well. They sold it as a big epic show and while it does become that, the first season is mostly about grappling fights in a tournament between the main characters. Between that and how cleaned up it was, the young audience turned back to the 100 other animes airing and the older audience laughed at it. "
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"It seems that you're talking about the first American dub made by DiC which was censored a lot.

It did get an uncut version by ADV which is a lot more faithful to the Japanese script. It still wasn't as successful."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I don't think this is even a Japanese production. The original Saint Seiya was Japanese, but this reboot/reimagining looks super western to me."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Then why don't they create an actual anime instead of a western 3-D animated series? Other than being based on a Japanese property, there's next to nothing aesthetically Japanese about this. "
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I think this is a short sighted attitude to take. Shuns gender is not pivotal to the character, whether Andromeda is a man or a woman makes no difference as long as the show is good.

Edit: folks it is your right to down vote, all I respectfully ask is if you do down vote to articulate your reasoning, thanks!"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"First, it’s easy in the way it play with the cliché : the guy has a pink armor representing a girl, he look/act like a girl, so let’s make him a girl. I was around 8 years old at the french release of St Seiya and that what I, as many if I remember correctly, though then.

Second, Shun, he’s actually the only of the five bronze Saint that goes away from that ""man must be tough"" male model but still manage to be a strong Saint in the end.

Third, what it’s gonna looks like the numerous time Ikki come to the rescue of Shun. The girl can’t defend herself and need the big strong man?

I’m all for inclusiveness but that have to be done sensibly wich doesn’t seems to have been the case here. The guy that looked like a girl became a girl and now, that girl will be see first as more weak and in need of a man.

Personally, I think Cygnus would have been a great choice, that would have made a strong female saint equal to the other with little change.

Ikki would have worked too and here, with Shun, you actually would have reversed the girl need a man thing and had Shun saved by his big sister. You could also change the two brothers, that would balance a lot a thing (my point 3 would not exist and point 1 would be minor).

Shiryu, with his Shunrei love story, that would have been more complicated but that could work.

Seiya, I wouldn’t have minded but too controversial."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,At first I was but i do remember this one two because of the armor power up being the gold pegasus armor well Ronin main up grade was white armor
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Compared to what it was a decade ago? Yeah. I said ""despite the fact that it has gone *so* mainstream."" That's a relative statement comparing its mainstream appeal now to what it had in the past."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Because in the original Shun was written as a bishonen. Some of his interaction with other characters is based on that trope. It won't work as well if he become a she. It's like changing Sasuke into a woman or Sakura into a man (in Naruto).
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Normally it wouldn't matter but shun in particular, it's a big fuck up for both sides"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,It's not that they haven't created actual anime. There is Devilman Crybaby and B The Beginning. 
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I disagree.

Now they have a bunch of gungho male saints and, oh what a coincidence, one female saint who is the opposite of the other main protagonists. Shun's gentleness/kindness/etc in spite of his gender might now be seen as being because of her gender.

Unless they completely change Shun's character to avoid that stereotype, but then that's as pivotal of a change as it gets.

And by your own logic, why change his gender if it makes no difference as long as the show is good?"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Thanks for your thoughts.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"100% Agree Shiryu or Ikki would have been great as female saints.
"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"That makes absolutely no sense, shuns character doesn't change at all if you change his gender, Sakura and Sasuke do only because of their sexual orientation. 

And saying it ""was written as a bishonen"" is really fucking stupid, then again, there's no point with arguing with people on the level of ""Netflix's agenda"" lol"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Not really, as long as the show is good. If it isn't, then they have bigger problems on their hands."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"They didn't make either of those. B The Beginning is Studio I.G. and Devilman Crybaby is Science Saru. Netflix just writes ""Netflix Original"" if they have the exclusive North American distribution license. It's totally misleading and as false as if Funimation called One Piece their ""original series."""
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I mean, nobody objected when they did it to Pidge."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Because it's a new show, and they are trying to update it. As the writer points out these kind of changes can work very well as it did for Battlestar Galactica. Of course it is up to you as the consumer to decide whether to watch it, but it's pretty silly to complain about any fictional characters gender being changed as long as their gender isn't central to the plot. I think we both agree that the only thing that matters is if it is good, it wouldn't matter at all if they changed every saint into a woman if the show is good, right?"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Bishonen is a staple in manga/anime culture. It's actually a very big deal. The yaoi vibe will be gone without Shun being an androgynous man. 

They can change Seiya or Shiryu gender for all I care. Their character tropes aren't gender specific so it doesn't change much. But Shun must be a bishonen.

Btw, in Sakura and Sasuke gender switch, sexual orientation is not a problem. Sakura must be a woman because her core character is a personification of feminism. She's written for teenage girls to look up to. As such she started like the average teenagers drooling over boys and such but grows into a capable and independent woman.

If Sasuke were to switch gender, his whole dynamic with Naruto or his brother will not work at all and the whole story will fall apart."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,I will never understand people who get super invested in a fictional characters race or gender. 
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,[deleted]
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"But of all characters, they change shun?! Like I dont think you understand the implications, they took some who defied gender norm (pacifist, emotional, sensitive and wears pink armor) to someone that would become a stereotype. The only way to prevent the character from becoming a stereotype is to rewrite the character and at that point, it's a completely new character. That affects the plot significantly "
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Because shun was the guy who defied gender norms and changing to a female makes the character a stereotype 
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"No, not the same at all. Bojack is a show that Netflix has the exclusive rights to in its country of origin. They may even have the authority to sell international rights to third parties outside the US. This stands in stark contrast to anime series that are controlled by a different company in their country of origin, and which Netflix has only licensed for north American distribution. "
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I think you are making a lot of assumptions over a show you haven't watched yet. Shun can still defy gender norms as a woman, and you're right it's a new show so the storyline will change. That's fine, if the show is good. Do you agree that's all that matters in the end, that it is good and entertaining?"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,You can't really say that about a character on a show you haven't seen. 
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Not really since basically taking away a beloved character is going to rub people the wrong way
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,It's the equivalent of changing the Tom boy character into a man
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Oh lord, what is that? The animation looks awful."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Yeeeah, I refuse to watch this in any language that isn't Spanish.

Also, why are the Bronze Saints fighting the military?"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Wow.  Graphically it looks pretty damn bad; those dead, dead eyes everywhere.  And the voice acting is pretty bad sounding, too.

I want to give the benefit of the doubt that maybe they were *trying* to make it look ""retro"" or something, but it looks way too far in the wrong direction.  I know the original is kinda a thing for a lot of people, so I'll probably give it a shot, but wow.  This doesn't even look like it compares with the quality of similar Trollhunters/3Below shows."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,That CGI animation is actually great here.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I used to live in Southern Utah and I would see them all the time at Walmart. The women were dressed in Little House on the Prarie garb and the men wore jeans and long sleeved flannel shirts. They refused to speak to you, wouldn't look at you. All were on food stamps, but drove big nice cars.

Made my skin crawl whenever I saw them because you knew what was happening."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,It was unbelievably disgusting. and the most disgusting part is how many individuals and law enforcement agencies conspired to cover this up and facilitate the crimes.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"There was a show on A&E called Escaping Polygamy that did a lot of work with people trying to get out of the FLDS/AUB community. The level of loyalty to Warren Jeffs was insane; one episode had a young woman packing to leave and she had to take his picture in her belongings. 

This show was well done. Episode four went hard with the evidence; I can't imagine being on that jury and having to hear the recordings."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Ugh this was way grosser than I even expected it to be. 🤮
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,One part highlighted that it was all human trafficking underage girls sold or exchanged between the older men to be abused. While young boys sold into construction labour across the US while the church gets a lot of the money. I wonder how much that still goes on
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Why is it religious cults are usually just a way for ugly dudes to get laid
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Just watched t last night and it’s so sad how many people decided to stay even after their leader was out in prison and the tapes of him raping a 12 old while a bunch of ladies watched came out

When the news guy who helped break the case was almost in tears describing the mostly female jurors reactions"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"It was very disturbing, but interesting. I’ve always had a deep interest in cults and the FLDS has always been one that just blows my mind every time. The stuff I heard in this documentary was absolutely disgusting and sad. The worst part was hearing that audio of that little girl being raped. There were other women in the room watching it happen. Just vile. They are so brainwashed and they don’t see how fucked up they are."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"When they played that disgusting audio at the end of pt.4 I was filled with an intense rage. 

How anyone can subject their 12 year old daughter to that is mind boggling."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,The documentary is very good and very sad when they interview the women who escaped. Men sold their young daughters and businesses to the prophet to have more wives. Then they were blackballed if they were seen as a threat or if the prophet felt intimidated by them. Then their wives and children were rehoused with someone else. The FLDS uses unpaid labor of young unmarried boys and young men to fulfill construction contractions for Walmart and Amazon. When there weren’t enough young girls to go around they’d send off the compound with no money and excommunicate them too.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,I wish we knew more of the life updates on some of the people they interviewed.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,[Reminder: Tucker Carlson thinks Warren Jeffs should be a free man.](https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/03/11/tucker-carlson-wont/)
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"“Under the Banner of Heaven” touched on fundamentalists Mormons too. It was an interesting miniseries because throughout the main murder plot they would have historical retelling of the Mormon founders. Not sure I want to watch another 4 hour of FLDS nutcases though.

Edit: The show stars the Amazing Spiderman actor as a practicing Mormon detective undergoing an existential crises while trying to solve a murder in 80s Utah, he’s gave a great performance. Apparently based on a true story. It’s on Hulu and the last episode aired recently so you can binge the whole thing, it wasn’t too long. Pretty good."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,women are so SMART even when the odds are stacked against them. watching the episode now where the woman was saying she wrote down the mileage on her husbands car and tracked the mud to find zion are you kidding me????
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Got a flat tire in Colorado city on my way to work once. It was terrifying. People won’t even make eye contact with you and there is no cell service. It’s just a surreal place. All the homes are unfinished to save on taxes.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"It's basically the Elite fundamentalist getting to choose any woman they fancy having, then disowning young boys and men because they serve no purpose to their religion. Nobody will have the guts to question it because they want to go to heaven. I mean how do you allow somebody to rape underage girls infront of you and then not say a word to anybody or a mother allowing their 14 year old to get married."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,The weird ceremonial room in the temple with the bed made me feel sick. Unbelievably horrific.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I grew up in the sister community to Colorado city. Warren Jeff's was caught, but the religion is still going on under a new high priest council. Placement marriage and polygamy are still common practice, trying to get girls married and child bearing the second they turn eighteen. Sometimes before. My dad has four wives, one of whom is a few years older than me. It's still going and it's still fucked"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Just finished watching it. That vault? Crazy what he kept in there😔
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Lots of fucked up people in a lot of pockets around the US
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Scrolling down and I saw the picture of the post (not reading the title), I went like « unbreakable, they are alive damn it » 😏"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"By far the most disturbing thing I have seen to date. It was very well done. That said, I could have done without the audio. I am scarred for life."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Orthodox Jewish communities also depend on welfare benefits. Small communities in NY take up a high percentage of the state's entire budget for benefits. The men study the bible full time and rarely work. Women work as well as are the caretakers. 

Religions have often exploited women. Patriarchy and power are the actual religion."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"The most difficult part for me was watching the interviews of former members who had willingly participated as adults.

Like so many of them seemed so self-righteous as they spoke about Warren and all of the things that had occured in the community like...y'all participated in it.

You married off your daughters to old, musty men and allowed your sons to be assaulted/raped and thrown out like garbage...and then sit there and brag about having a ""happy"" 30 years of marriage with your wives and complain about having ""my guns taken away."" 

Even the ones that I felt bad for - Alicia etc. Why in the *world* would you stay after being ""reassigned"" a husband TWICE and then having your children snatched away for a year? Ridiculous.

I was also astounded to see just how recent a lot of their defection was. 2012 and 2015 was not at all long ago which made me so unbelievably sad for everyone involved. I was thinking they had all left like 15-20 years ago...for some of them its barely been 10."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,This was so infuriating to watch albeit a good doc. Warren Jeffs is a cold ugly man and I hope the fucker is having a horrible time in jail
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"I actually thought the doc was pretty tame. I've read several of the memoirs by some of the participants, and the details in them were pretty horrific."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Reading the article was disturbing enough for me, but this story deserves to be told."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Watching this right now. Disturbing!
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Well done and stomach-churning.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,I went through a phase of reading ex-flds cult members memoirs…horrifying.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"This guy was the most dangerous gangster in America. Crooked cops covering his crimes, massive child abuse and trafficking, forced labor - absolutely insane. I knew about the sexual assaults but the scale of this cult’s power is almost unbelievable."
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,"Tucker Carlson also famously defended Warren Jeffs in a radio interview because he ""might be a child rapist, but he plans to take care of them for the rest of their lives"" as if that makes it somehow less worse"
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,Last Podcast gets into Warren Jeffs a bit on their Mormonism series. Sent me down a crazy rabbit hole.
Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter,When will we actually have the balls to say “ this is not a religion but a cult of pedophiles” they want to have a harem of underage girls to pick and choose from. The whole thing is disgusting.
El Cartel,what is our world
El Cartel,Shame on vh1
El Cartel,[deleted]
El Cartel,Let’s just keep glamorizing the worst society has to offer eh?
El Cartel,"If VH1 was around in the late 40s I’m sure they would have made a show following the wives of SS officers.

Bunch of degenerates."
El Cartel,We live in a simulation
El Cartel,Who the fuck is going to be the crew? No way I would ever do the hair and makeup of a woman marrried to EL Chapo. She ends up on air with some lipstick on her teeth and boom you end up on a milk box
El Cartel,She SERIOUSLY wants to go on american television and talk about the Sinaloa cartel when they're stronger than ever right now putting her life in danger? lol ok I guess.
El Cartel,The world is really fucked up.
El Cartel,What even is vh1 anymore?
El Cartel,Ooh next they should do a reality show on the families of genocidal maniacs!
El Cartel,VH1 is fucking trash. I remember watching general Top 20 music videos a decade ago but that's it.
El Cartel,I'm kind of disappointed he didn't do a better job of providing for her retirement.  This really hurt my opinion of El Chapo.
El Cartel,This is how we have fallen as a society.
El Cartel,Thanks ladies.
El Cartel,"Twitter ""activists"" cancel people that make asian jokes but can't cancel this garbage? Shame on anyone that watches this garbage. Shame on VH1."
El Cartel,Have you ever played sim city and got bored to the point where you destroy it with every natural disaster?
El Cartel,Peak trash.
El Cartel,Shame on the *millions* of people that are going to waste their lives watching it.
El Cartel,Because neither VH1 nor the American public have any principles.
El Cartel,"> Like what next, ISIS wives reality show?

You say this as if people wouldn't watch the shit out of it."
El Cartel,"We already had that awful Mafia wives show... it’s disgusting. Jersey Shore was one thing, and it was somewhat entertaining, but cmon let’s stop giving money to these criminals."
El Cartel,"This got a chuckle out of me. Have an imaginary $5, guy."
El Cartel,She got more balls then the entire Mexican government
El Cartel,i’ve never played the game but yes i’ve thought about that
El Cartel,"i wish it was peak, but it seems to just keep getting worse"
El Cartel,Truth
El Cartel,"As long as it isn’t happening to them, no one cares much."
El Cartel,I heard Burqa Bitches is already in production at Starz
El Cartel,"Well atleast the mafia is pretty much just a bunch of poorly dressed italian slobs pulling credit card frauds now, not much to glorify there"
El Cartel,These types of shows are basically what happens when you lock Sims in a room with no means of escaping.
El Cartel,I know it's a meme at this point but Idiocracy is becoming real life.
El Cartel,**GABBBAGOOOL**
El Cartel,Lol not true if you actually know the mafia
El Cartel,"meme or not, it’s pretty much true"
El Cartel,oh that's not too derivative of like 5 other shows and movies
El Cartel,Or you could make this Narcos Season 3... Just saying
El Cartel,Man why the fuck did they put the hashtag in the title.
El Cartel,But how are ancient aliens involved?
El Cartel,.#Idontknow
El Cartel,because El Chapo invented Twitter.
El Cartel,Who do you think dug that tunnel to his jail cell?
El Cartel,"I hope it is as good as Narcos. Seeing Pablos story were awesome, I hope they make El Chapos as good"
El Cartel,"I'd love to see a season focused on ""The French Connection"" and a follow up past that in a following season to the Frank Lucas era.

We have a whole other ""drug"" war from the 60s and 70s to explore.

Also do we know enough about Tse Chi Lop to explore ""The Asian El Chapo"" ?"
El Cartel,">Or even drug trafficking into Europe by the prominent Mafias there.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroZeroZero

ZeroZeroZero is an Italian crime drama television series created by Stefano Sollima, Leonardo Fasoli and Mauricio Katz for Sky Atlantic, Canal+ and Amazon Prime Video."
El Cartel,Would be good to see one based on the golden triangle and the pacific trade.
El Cartel,Narcos: Canadian Dairy Cartel
El Cartel,"Narcos: High School

A high school student makes crystal meth and sells it at school. A special team of police officers who look like teenagers go undercover."
El Cartel,I'd like to see a season set during the Vietnam war when heroine was being smuggled into the country in solder's coffins.
El Cartel,"This month **Narcos-Saints** premiered on Netflix. It's a korean show about a Korean drug boss in the South American country Suriname.

It's loosely based on real events of the life of real drug boss Jo Bong Haeng. Jo is said to have created a channel of drug smuggling and supply in the 1990s while he was in Suriname. He was arrested in 2009 in a joint investigation by South Korea, Brazil and the United States."
El Cartel,The blonde American actor from season 1 of Narcos being in Netflix’s The Sandman made me realize I never finished this show! And now I plan on going back and watching
El Cartel,"As a Brazilian, I would like to see a show focused on São Paulo in the 1990s and early 2000s. That's when the largest Brazilian criminal organization was founded.

HBO did a great documentary about this. It was released a few months ago on HBO Max Latin America. (edit: it was released in the US as *PCC, Secret Power*)"
El Cartel,"A story about this guy would be awesome
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khun_Sa"
El Cartel,What I'd like to see is what was actually going on in the CIA during this time.
El Cartel,"triads or Yakuza, need me some Asian trafficking"
El Cartel,Frank Larry Matthews (aka Black Ceaser). I'm a bit amazed theres never been a big production about him. He was bigger than Frank Lucas.
El Cartel,A show where we actually see how Escobar started snuggling. The show glossed over the entire thing
El Cartel,"I've heard Sacred Games is like an Indian Narcos, and even though it's not based on a true story you could possibly enjoy that if what they say is true."
El Cartel,I came here to recommend ZeroZeroZero too. Such an amazing show.
El Cartel,"No meth, but Extracurricular is about a teen prostitution broker."
El Cartel,"We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle sh*t from the past and expect us all not to notice

“Deputy Chief Hardy-21 Jump Street”"
El Cartel,"> Netflix’s The Sandman

Ohhh that's where i know him from"
El Cartel,">	The blonde American actor 


Put some god damn respect [Boyd Holbrook’s](https://m.imdb.com/name/nm2933542/?ref_=m_ttfcd_cl2) name. He’s earned it."
El Cartel,It would be funny if they cast a Colombian to play a Brazilian main character.
El Cartel,">A show where we actually see how Escobar started snuggling.

Do you want to see him snuggle with his wife or with his mistress?"
El Cartel,Yea it was just hinted at the first episode. Kind of like a prequel of sorts I guess
El Cartel,"The Mexican parts were awesome, the USA/Italian parts were lacking in comparison. But a really good overall"
El Cartel,"Colombian*

*sigh*"
El Cartel,Preferably with El Cuddlio
El Cartel,"No, I was referring to an inhabitant of the city in South Carolina :-)

A proud city with a history of public drunkenness, gambling and poor sanitation (this is actually true, the city put it on their website)."
El Cartel,"Give a try to Pataal Lok, McMafia, The Family Man (all on Prime). Seeing your list, I have a feeling you'll like these."
El Cartel,"vouch for ZeroZeroZero the way the episodes are structured and shot were just incredible, really blew me away at points"
El Cartel,"I'd definitely recommend Der Pass (also known as Pagan Peak), despite being the latest foreign spin off of Broen Bron (this time being between Germany and Austria) its an incredibly well made, well written series that plays very cleverly with the source ideas and features a lot of the beautiful scenery of the alps."
El Cartel,"dude watch paatal lok, simply the best thing to come from indian web space. it's on prime. much much darker than sacred games."
El Cartel,Babylon Berlin?
El Cartel,"I honestly haven't watched this one, but Cocaine Coast (2018) could be a another series in your list. It is a Spanish series set in the 80s about how tobacco smugglers in Galicia turned into narcos. It is also based on real events."
El Cartel,The Chalet is a six-episode French mystery series on Netflix that's wonderfully suspenseful.
El Cartel,"Exellent list. And while it's not a crime show per se, but rather a spy thriller, I'd like to add [Le Bureau des Légendes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4063800/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0), which is simply the best series French TV has produced in the past 20 years."
El Cartel,Amazing. Thanks very much. Great suggestions on the thread as well.
El Cartel,Try Broen / Broen or The Bridge on Hulu
El Cartel,You should watch Hotel Beau Sejour
El Cartel,My dad loved The Sniffer. The premise sounds ridiculous but he really enjoyed it.
El Cartel,"Thanks for the list! Will check out ZeroZeroZero and a few others, once I finish Money Heist."
El Cartel,ZeroZeroZero is like if Gomorrah and McMafia had a baby.  I think you'll like McMafia very much.
El Cartel,"In addition to *Spiral (Engrenages)* which you mentioned, I also enjoyed:

* 1) *Varg Veum* - A (mostly) serious Norwegian crime show, but some light humor mixed in with it.

* 2) *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (this is more of a light hearted, ""whodunit"" one, but I really like the humor and the cast, though fair warning, they do keep the sexism of the era in there, so you may find the main character a bit off putting at times, but that's kind of the point too). It is titled as *The Little Murders of Agatha Christie* in English. Almost forgot to mention it, but there are 2 separate shows under that name. I'm talking specifically Series 2, which is the one set in the 50s/60s. There's an earlier one with the same name in the 30s that I didn't get into. 
* 3) *Witnesses (Les Témoins)* - Another good, serious French show."
El Cartel,"GREAT list!!! 
Gomorrah is a top 3 for me. Can’t get enough of it. 
Completely agree on Suburra, zerozerozero, spiral, sacred games. 

As others said I highly recommend Pataal Lok and Der Pass. Two of the best shows by far I’ve watched this year."
El Cartel,"If you enjoy dirty cops, you might enjoy the film *Bad Lieutenant* with Harvey Keitel."
El Cartel,"Thanks for all the recommendations, I feel I might spend a lot of this month sat in front of a TV, well, slightly more than the previous two months."
El Cartel,"I loved Gomorrah, but I'm having trouble finding seasons 3 and 4 in the US. Does anyone know how/where I can watch it?"
El Cartel,"You should watch De Dag (The Day), its a 12 part series about a bank robbery. The odd numbers are from the perspective of the cops and the even numbers from the perspective of the robbers 

It's a german series i think, really liked it"
El Cartel,"McMafia was a really water-cooler show when it came out in the UK. Compelling series with James Norton as a fantastic lead.

Although, there is a lot of Russian and Hebrew dialogue - this is predominantly an English speaking show."
El Cartel,"This will be my next watch, sounds great."
El Cartel,I really like the sound of this one.
El Cartel,"Good film, Keitel is brilliant in it."
El Cartel,"Yeah, other than torrents or kodi, you might struggle.

Unless its on the new HBO platform?"
El Cartel,"> McMafia 

Has the been any news on season 2? They renewed it and then nothing."
El Cartel,"I've tried kodi, but there's always an issue with the subtitles unfortunately"
El Cartel,"I always have an hard time to choose between Seasons 3,4,5 and 6 of Game of Thrones. I love them all for different reasons and all of those are some of my favorites seasons ever.

Some of my others favorites seasons ever:

Vikings Seasons 3 and 4

Banshee Season 3

How to Get Away With Murder Season 1

Ozark Season 3

True Blood Season 3

Orange is the New Black Season 4

American Horror Story Seasons 2 and 6

Black Sails Season 3

The Last Kingdom Season 2"
El Cartel,"Great picks for Office and Sopranos, those are my favourite seasons. I'd pick Season 3 for Breaking Bad but I agree that the earlier seasons are the best, I wasn't huge on Seasons 4 and 5 and agree that it's overrated honestly.

My favourite seasons:

The Good Place Season 1

I feel like I'm alone in thinking this show dropped off after the start of Season 2, but Season 1 is absolute perfection. Every single episode has some kind of hook to keep up the suspense and keep you watching while also interweaving comedy and ethics. The way that you can watch the season twice and feel like you're experiencing a completely different show, the myriad twists that keep building and building up until the final reveal, the characters that are expertly drawn right from the pilot. It's an episode of The Twilight Zone done for a whole season without losing pace once. I wish the rest of the season had kept more of the dramatic elements rather than being a philosophical comedy, but I'll always look back on this season fondly.

Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Season 2

The first season was great but felt a bit weighed down by having to fill out 18 episodes. With only 13 episodes in this season, the show pushes pretty much every character in a new direction. In Season 1, Rebecca keeps thinking: if only I have a romantic relationship, my life will be perfect. Season 2 says, ok, you've got it. Now what? The answer is a fascinating exploration of anxiety, depression, and the emphasis society places on true love. Paula gets to explore what a life based on her own values would look like, Greg starts living for himself, and Valencia gets completely retooled. Plus the songs are the best in the series.

You're the Worst Season 2

LCD Soundsystem is probably my favourite episode of television ever. I feel like the rest of the show, including season 1, never really lives up to the masterful arc of Gretchen's depression and existential angst that we explore in Season 2, but the season's experiments with genre and character arcs will stick with me.

Bojack Horseman Season 4

This show was already good, but Season 4 pulls things in a completely different direction. Every season gives Bojack some kind of celebrity project; a memoir, a movie, an oscar campaign. 4 doesn't. After the disastrous events of Season 3, Bojack is left reeling, and he gets to try again with his daughter Hollyhock where he failed with Sarah Lynn. Other characters get great arcs, and Ruthie in particular makes Princess Carolyn a tragic figure on par with Bojack. Time's Arrow is one of my favourite TV episodes ever, and the best of the dramatic twist 11th episodes the show has done. Season 5 and Season 3 are also close contenders.

She-Ra Season 3

She-Ra struggled to find its momentum in the first two seasons but came out swinging with Season 3. Every episode contributes to a shocking sci-fi climax, and character arcs that have been set up since the first episode finally get paid off here. Warrior vagabonds in the desert, holographic messages from the past, alternate timelines, and a series great episode where every character makes the worst possible decision is one of the series' best.

Avatar Season 2

Season 1 is a good setup, but I feel like some of the episodes aren't firing on all cylinders. Season 3 is great, but its first half doesn't quite compete with the nonstop action of Season 2. ""There is no war in Ba Sing Se"" is still used to this day, and the idea of introducing a different faction from the Fire Nation that's just as diabolical but in a completely different way makes for fascinating television. The decision to let Aang and friends stay in one place and really explore what Ba Sing Se is like brings so much life to the Avatar world. The show also gets experimental with episodes like the one focussed on Appa, Zuko Alone, and the tearjerking Tales from Ba Sing Se. Azula and her trio also bring a lot of tension to the show and make great new antagonists.

The Good Wife Season 5

The serialization gets kicked up a notch in this season, while relationships and character arcs that have been building since the first season explode in abrupt and tragic ways. This also has one of the best send offs for an actor who wanted off the show that I've seen.

Infinity Train Season 3

I wasn't a huge fan of the first two seasons of Infinity Train, but Season 3 really kicks things into high gear. The show moves away from the smaller stakes of the first two seasons with characters dealing with things like bullying and their parents' divorce, to exploring morality, cults, propaganda, and what it means to be human. We also get interesting expansions to the lore, some characters from the first two seasons get brought back with added depth, and the decision to have three passengers that have issues they need resolved leads to great and shocking conflict. Plus that musical number that kicks off the season is great.

Barry Season 2

ronnie/lilly is amazing, and the rest of the season is no slouch either. Every actor is bringing their A game, it's hilarious, violent, and even darker than the first season.

Hannibal Season 2

More serialized, more artistically shot gore, and a beautifully constructed, heartpounding finale. On top of that, the show incorporates more characters from the novels, goes through every possible manifestation of Will and Hannibal's relationship, to bitter enemies to monstrous coworkers and back again. I still get chills thinking about that teacup breaking. Mizumono might be my favourite season finale ever.

Steven Universe Season 1

This is a bit of an odd choice, but I feel like this season captures the slice of life stuff with the impending sense of doom that the lore brings best. Coming of age stories feel like they're perfectly made for TV, but we don't see them play out very often.  Steven's struggle to have a carefree childhood while the specter of the gems trauma and past fighting in the war make a perfect metaphor for growing up.  Everything is cheerful and fun, but there's this undercurrent that no one treats you seriously and that everyone's keeping secrets from you.

Legend of Korra Season 3

My nomination for best season in the worst show, I don't think Korra ever really figured itself out, but this season was a shining moment of what Korra could be when it was firing on all cylinders. The action scenes are beautiful, the show finally gets a villain that has interesting motivations while also being a legitimate threat, Tenzin's kids get more to do, and meeting Beifong's family pushes her character forward and shows us a new and fascinating part of the world. The ending shot of the season is heartbreaking.

Halt and Catch Fire Season 4

Perfect ending to a great show. The way it explores tragedy and grief is heartbreaking, but when I think about how much I love the season I go back to the plotline in an early episode where Cameron and Joe spend almost the entire episode on the phone with each other. There's this dreamy quality to it, a faint feeling of two people exploring a kinder, gentler reality than the one they're living in.

Succession Season 2

This season works like a set of dominoes ready to set off a detonator. It's hilarious, it's weird, it's shocking, and the finale is fantastic. Every actor is at the top of their game, and watching the dual stories of Shiv finally getting her day in the spotlight while Kendall is crushed by the weight of his sins in Season 1 makes for great television. Just when you think the season is ending in the only way it can, it shocks you again. Huge step up from season 1.

Honorable mention to Leftovers Season 2, which I remember loving but it's been six years since I saw it so I don't feel confident writing about it. You specified only shows with multiple seasons, but if I could pick shows with one expertly crafted season I would choose I May Destroy You, Sharp Objects, and Watchmen."
El Cartel,"I'd go (my personal Favs) 

Wire Season 4

Im counting the OG Band Of Brothers suck my dick mini series sayers

Breaking Bad 4 (although 2-4 are all equals in my book) 

Lost Season 1

Last one is tough I dunno

I'd say one of GOT S1-4 but the last 3 episodes killed the series completely 

So

Let's say Attack on Titan S1"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,[deleted]
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Have you seen the first episode of the new show yet? It's fantastic! This show is going to be amazing!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I'm 15 episodes in and... yeah, can't exactly give it a ringing endorsement. It's vaguely watchable if you don't mind subtitles, but technically it's a mess. 

Then there's the racism... Ep 15 in particular lays on the ""One China Is Best China"" vibe pretty thick, with Bruce going off on what I can only call a racist rant about japanese people before, and again after, beating up the school's Karate team in the middle of a school presentation - and the whole school, who minutes before were cheering for their beloved karate team, totally side with Bruce, a first-week transfer student they've never seen before. Then when the team confront Bruce with a formal challenge for a public fight later, at his home, he calls *them* bullies... "
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Gave me cancer. But, I'm unlucky."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I would give anything for this.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Please god
The Legend of Bruce Lee,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The Legend of Bruce Lee,yes please
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I would be all in
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Yes! Do it! :-)
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The Legend of Bruce Lee,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I live for this show.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,And Billy Drago :(
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Same
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Just don’t have it on Starz
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Same!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,You don't know Jack
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Sho Nuff!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The Legend of Bruce Lee,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,You love to hear it
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Such a good show
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Glad this show is coming back. Pretty entertaining.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I came in skeptical but the show was a lot of fun.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"I freaking love this show, so glad we're getting another season!"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,This show was fucking awesome from start to finish. keep it going.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"If you get a chance , pick up Bruce’s book The Tao of JeetKuneDo. It’s amazing and an introspective look at how he combines philosophy and martial arts to make what we call today MMA.  Back in the early 70s there was no colloquial word for how he thought."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Goddamn this show is good. Things *happen* on the show. Like, audience expectations and suspense is set up that x might happen and then POW! W Y & Z all happen, fast and unexpected, and now the characters will have to deal with that. They are not on a decompressed schedule and I love it."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Is there a way to watch this show in Europe? Is it on Sky?
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"> This article was created by our marketing department in collaboration with our partners at HBO Max.  

Top quality content only in this sub."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Why did Tarantino portray Lee as a punk-ass bitch again?
The Legend of Bruce Lee,">However, the pitch was deemed too progressive for the 1970s

lol I'm sure that's exactly how the network execs phrased it"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,There's a new piece about this show every few days on this sub. We get it.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"The problem is whenever the character that was on 21 jump street comes on I start singing the theme song and my wife hates me for it…. 21 juuuump street…. It looks like he will have a larger role next season, hope my marriage can handle it."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Unless you’re Japanese.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,It’s on sky in the UK I believe
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"So, should be on Sky Deutschland as well."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I feel like the author needs to either watch or address shows like *Invincible* or *Pantheon*.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,I really love Vox Machina.  So glad we already know it will have a third season!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Anime Watchers: What gap??
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Absolutely love this show, it’s just so much fun with great characters and voice acting and amazing fight scenes"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Undone was the shit
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Really feel the same way about it. The earnestness is what sets it apart for me. It wears its heart entirely on its sleeve from moving emotional moments of growth to the kind of raunchy jokes and swearing people rattle off with their real friends. It feels far more real.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It's fun. Too much toilet Humor at times but it's a nice destraction from the usual doom and gloom stuff.

The characters are assholes sometimes but not *all* of them and not *all* the time.

The world is colourful and bright."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Just finished the first season. Its ok... Nothing really spectacular storywise and the animations are a bit weak.

It might be because I've just finished shows like Invincible, Castlevania, and Arcane. But this pales in comparison. As someone not familiar with Critical Role, there's nothing I've gathered from the first season to make me care about the characters or the world."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It’s ok, but got tired of them trying too hard to be “adult” with the jokes, sex references and swear words. Like calm TF down and let your story breathe, folks."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It's become one of my favourite series of many many years.

Love the animation style, the characters, the silly jokes. I love videogames and medieval fantasy and we don't get many shows like it.

I had no idea what critical role even was before to be honest."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It kind of feels like ""Western anime"", to me. In that it's a lot of fun, but it *does* feel like it sticks to themes of ""the power of friendship"" a bit *too* much. Like... sometimes, it feels like they sort of achieve things through sheer power of *emotions*, rather than tactics.

I also feel like, as fun as the action *looks*, it sometimes feels a bit like visual-noise. I'm kind of a novice when it comes to tabletop RPG's, and my father (who I've been watching it with) had never played one (though he's a big fan of MMORPG's), and it doesn't feel like there's any sort of consistency on how powerful these characters are or what they can do? I don't need hard ""power-levels"" or anything, but it's just hard understanding where these characters are in relation to the world around them. They seem effectively demigods sometimes, and then relatively ""normal"" other times.

Overall though, it's been fun.

My only two criticism are A) they lean *super* hard into ""this character is on the verge of death! wait, not really, they're totally fine"". Like... it felt like almost every episode. A part of me actually *wants* a character to die -- not because I don't like any of them, but because it's a cheap writing tactic to get people invested, and they've done it so much that it feels like there are no stakes. Either stop doing the ""fake-out"", or actually kill somebody.

The other criticism, for me, mainly concerns Vax (I think? the male twin). I get Critical Role is all about being super inclusive, that's something baked-into the world they've made. For a lot of folks, and probably the creators themselves, that's part of the appeal. But it creates for kind of a confusing world when seemingly everyone is attracted to everyone else, and in the case of him specifically, I feel like it's created a situation where I don't understand what the relationship dynamics are supposed to be. It feels... inconsistent. The characters can all be Bi, that's fine, but just help us understand what their relationships are, to each other and to other recurring characters."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Yeah honestly it rubs me the wrong way that invincible came out first but vox got a s2 first.

Also I would probably put this lower than shows like invincible, Castlevania, Primal, and arcane. STILL really fantastic, but idk that's just me."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Easily one of the best animated shows I’ve seen. Considering that the original goal was one 22-minute special episode for longtime fans, the actual outcome is phenomenal. It’s amazing to see this love project become so successful. All of my love to the Critical Role Fam."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Huge gap??
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It's thoroughly okay, in all aspects. Fun time-filler but I wouldn't call it exemplary in any regard."
The Legend of Bruce Lee,world??? lol. japan put 20 anime a season. Gtfo.
The Legend of Bruce Lee,Vox Machina is just flat out a really good show.  I'm not a D&D guy at all and just randomly popped the show on one day and have been hooked.  Can't wait for season 3!
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"Great show, definitely recommend it"
The Legend of Bruce Lee,"It is… okay. Lotta fan service that cuts into the show. I wouldn’t call it bad, but I really can’t suggest it to anyone who isn’t a fan of the stream."
The Magic School Bus,"RIP Joanna Cole

Frizzle and the gang got child-me to love and into sciences and space. The imagination ran wild! Take chances, make mistakes, get messy! Beep beep"
The Magic School Bus,Getting that scholastic book fair poster buying nostalgia.
The Magic School Bus,"I hope the live-action lives up to Joanna Cole's expectations, even though she won't get to see it. What a dream, to write something that will live on long after your gone."
The Magic School Bus,"I was a bit too old for the show when it aired, but I loved the books as a kid. Sad to see. Especially coming so close on the heals to Tomie Depaola's passing."
The Magic School Bus,[deleted]
The Magic School Bus,"Joanna Cole also wrote the books ""Im a Big Brother/Sister"" that was super useful for making my oldest child feel good about the birth of my youngest.

RIP and thanks."
The Magic School Bus,NOT THE OG RICK AND MORTY!!!
The Magic School Bus,"the black girl on magic school bus showed me i could excel in the sciences. 

that little bit of role modeling, even as a cartoon, was enough of a little door opening to allow me to do all i’ve done. 

rip joanna cole, and thank you."
The Magic School Bus,"Those were some of my favorite books as a kid. It's a pretty solid achievement to educate so many children in a way most of them will still find memorable years and years later. 

When Beverly Cleary goes, I'm going to be a useless wreck."
The Magic School Bus,"Joanna Cole thank you for all the amazing memories. Ms. Frizzle was a gift to me and my fellow classmates every Friday afternoon when our teacher would start a new topic. 

RIP"
The Magic School Bus,Rest in peace legend
The Magic School Bus,Here’s to Carlos and Dorothy-Ann fighting over first dibs of research in heaven.
The Magic School Bus,"Of all the deaths in 2020, this one hit me the most. May she rest.

She defined my childhood."
The Magic School Bus,"She joins Ralphie in the afterlife (in my mind, he died tragically young)"
The Magic School Bus,I met the guy that wrote the theme song at a dinner party. He seemed very surprised that I would think that was the coolest accolade one could hold. Shook his hand and him thank you.
The Magic School Bus,2020 is really being a little phucker
The Magic School Bus,Rest in peace to the woman who made the only other science movies (besides Bill Nye) that actually got my attention and I actually learned stuff. Giving me my want to learn electricity. Well played Joanna Cole. I hope you enjoyed your life to the full
The Magic School Bus,"Oh man...this, for some reason, hits me in the feels. I was babysitting my friend's 2 year old daughter the other day and we were chilling, watching the new Ms. Frizzle & the rest of the gang on Netflix. It brought back so many memories and I'm so glad I was able to bond with her over the Magic School Bus."
The Magic School Bus,RIP! You are a legend!
The Magic School Bus,That intestines episode is forever etched into my brain.
The Magic School Bus,"She had an amazing influence on so many people.

She even sent me a card when I was in the second grade-- I wrote her a letter, and wanted a whole book dedicated to myself and she was kind enough to send me a post card with the cover from the adventure the class took to the dinosaur times...

Except the class was referencing me. Maybe one of my favorite childhood memories ever. Rest in peace, Joanna Cole."
The Magic School Bus,"Magic School Bus is still one of the most creative, cool, inclusive discovery and science shows ever made. The Netflix reboot is really good too."
The Magic School Bus,"First the creator of Clifford, then Little Bear, then both creators of The Berenstein Bears, and now the creator of The Magic School Bus! Please don't take away Amy Tan (creator of Sagwa) next."

God, i miss the days when id wake up to ""SEATBELTS EVERYONE!"" or go to school and they got the TV on the cart out, (which 9/10 times was a VHS copy of The Magic School Bus)"
The Magic School Bus,2020 -- the year that keeps on taking.
The Magic School Bus,fuck you 2020
The Magic School Bus,My son looooved these books! He learned so much about science and still does today! RIP Joanna.
The Magic School Bus,The world got a little bit darker today. Rip
The Magic School Bus,"Bless this lady, many fond memories watching this show as a kid."
The Magic School Bus,"RIP Joanna. She leaves a fantastic legacy of getting children interested in science and learning in general.

Both my young sons have been loving the newer Netflix series and have learned a ton of really advanced concepts from it. We’re going to try them on the OG episodes next."
The Magic School Bus,Rest In Peace.  You were an awesome part of my childhood and I appreciate your positive effect on my life.
The Magic School Bus,"She was an absolutely wonderful woman who got millions of kids interested in science. I loved the Magic School Bus books and tv show growing up, and I know for a fact that I owe my interest in astronomy to it. All my love and appreciation to you, Joanna Cole."
The Magic School Bus,That’s it. 2020 is now cancelled.
The Magic School Bus,"Magic School Bus was such an influential and educational show. I happened to watch the computer episode after receiving my BS in computer science and was really impressed with the high level overview they gave, for a topic most adults struggle to accurately explain to this day. No hacker movie non-sense, no comparisons to human anatomy, just following electrons as they moved through the machine. The mysterious magic box de-mystified in a way that respected the intelligence of its audience."
The Magic School Bus,Thanks 2020!!!  You're going after and finishing off fond childhood memories now....
The Magic School Bus,I hope she’s teaching kids about science in that school in the sky.
The Magic School Bus,Well this is what I'm watching as I go to sleep in Netflix instead of the Office for a week or so.. rip. You changed my life for the better.
The Magic School Bus,I can smell the scholastic book fair when I think of magic school bus. Take me back to simpler times.
The Magic School Bus,"My uncle passed away from suicide a little over a year. In the 90s, his job was to drive he magic school bus across the country. As a kid, I would brag to everyone that my uncle was Ms Frizzle"
The Magic School Bus,REST IN PEACE. I remember in 4th grade watching it when it was someone’s birthday in class
The Magic School Bus,"RIP Queen, you were such an essential part of my childhood and you don't even know it. Tragic. May you find eternal rest in eternal paradise. Welcome, everything is fine, you're in the good place now. <3"
The Magic School Bus,School was so much more exciting when we got to watch magic school bus
The Magic School Bus,"I remember watching the magic school bus every morning before going to school and i remember the magic school bus books we read in class i miss those times... R.I.P Joanna🕊🙏🏻 
And thank you for such a good fun educational show and for the books that let our imagination roam free."
The Magic School Bus,F man. I grew up w this show.
The Magic School Bus,It taught me so much when it came to visualizing in learning.
The Magic School Bus,"For real??

Id like to thank her for making Science class just a little more interesting"
The Magic School Bus,[deleted]
The Magic School Bus,Into the unknown.  Rest in Magic.
The Magic School Bus,May her soul rest in peace
The Magic School Bus,WHAT NOW 2020!
The Magic School Bus,First Grant and now Ms Frizzle? My childhood science teachers!
The Magic School Bus,This really is the worst timeline
The Magic School Bus,It’s as if 2020 is taking away all the saints before it turns to chaos
The Magic School Bus,2020 HAS TAKEN IT WAY TOO FAR
The Magic School Bus,"We named our youngest daughter Keesha , we loved your show .  Rest in peace ❤️"
The Magic School Bus,"2020 you can SMD for real. Stop taking people away from our childhoods, and futures."
The Magic School Bus,This hits me right in the childhood
The Magic School Bus,I aced all my high school science classes thanks to her and Bill Nye.
The Magic School Bus,Damn.
The Magic School Bus,"The Magic School Bus were my favourite books as a kid and since I didn't have money for book club I tried to find the complete series in the library, no dice. Now the old series is on Netflix and I try to watch it with my toddler."
The Magic School Bus,That’s a picture of her basement…
The Magic School Bus,Wish it was me instead.
The Magic School Bus,😥
The Magic School Bus,"I wasn’t the target demo by the time I watched it, but she taught me about muscle cramp and I always remembered the show fondly."
The Magic School Bus,"Wow... RIP to the lady that set the standard for the type of teacher I want to be. I have a closet full of ""Ms. Frizzle"" dresses because of how much I love the series."
The Magic School Bus,😔
The Magic School Bus,"Damn. This show taught me SO MUCH as a kid. To the point where I thought I wanted to be an astronaut, or a scientist. Turns out I just wanted to write... thanks to this show and the lady that created it."
The Magic School Bus,fuk2020
The Magic School Bus,"Damn, I forgot how great Magic School Bus was. The episode with Molly Cule was always a blast lol"
The Magic School Bus,"I would love a live action movie of this show of the kids grown up but Ms Frizzle has one more adventure to give them or something.


Edit: I’ll be damned, they are making a movie!"
The Magic School Bus,Fuck man. I’ll never forget the human body episode. I think it inspired me to pursue medicine.  No joke.
The Magic School Bus,"Alright, I guess the world has officially ended."
The Magic School Bus,Fuck 2020
The Magic School Bus,I remember going to friends houses as a kid and if they had this game on their computer it was all I wanted to play!! I watched the show a bit but the game got me so excited about adventures and into computers. RIP thank you for so much inspiration.
The Magic School Bus,Use to watch this everyday after school
The Magic School Bus,She changed my life that’s for sure. RIP Joanna Cole.
The Magic School Bus,Thank you for my imaginations.
The Magic School Bus,I remember seeing those books in scholastic
The Magic School Bus,Rest In Peace ☹️
The Magic School Bus,Is that a bootyhole?...
The Magic School Bus,No way 😫😭
The Magic School Bus,rip mAn
The Magic School Bus,The computer games were dope
The Magic School Bus,"I have rewatched this show every few years purely for the science, especially the ecology."
The Magic School Bus,"My condolences.


And for the rest of us we will be going on the wildest Magic School Bus ride when schools open without regard for the current PANDEMIC."
The Magic School Bus,"Apparently her net worth was 2 mill, I thought it would be more for some reason"
The Magic School Bus,Great series! I have fond memories of watching the series after school. Joanna Cole you will be missed
The Magic School Bus,"As a kid, my first entry to the magic school bus had been an educational game where the gang goes to the rainforest and spot different types of flora and fauna. I must have played that game so many times that I still remember the animals. It was also one of the first representations of a cool and smart woman in my life. RIP Joanna Cole"
The Magic School Bus,Rip
The Magic School Bus,I just bought a bunch of those books for my new nephew.  RIP Joanna.  Ms. Frizzle forever.
The Magic School Bus,:(
The Magic School Bus,God damn it... I remember watching this on PBS when my family couldn’t afford regular tv. RIP
The Magic School Bus,"I’m not going to downvote this in practice, but I do downvote it in Spirit."
The Magic School Bus,I hate 2020 so much
The Magic School Bus,This way too hard
The Magic School Bus,"Rest in peace, Joanna Cole."
The Magic School Bus,2020 Strikes again... FFS
The Magic School Bus,"First Little Richard now Joanna Cole. 

This year must hate Magic School Bus."
The Magic School Bus,2020 still sucking more by the day
The Magic School Bus,I remember the episode where they shrunk themselves and the bus to go inside one of their classmates to get a watermelon seed they swallowed. Or am I just crazy?
Gu Family Book,Surprisingly good episode with a weird nod to Wes Anderson.
Gu Family Book,"This was one of those episodes someone posted on Reddit once as an example of ""The Simpsons is still good!!"" 

I tried watching it and had to tap out after like 4 minutes. If you like this then good on ya but to me this is some of the worst shit ever. When the show has been going on so long that they feel the need to develop Comic Book Guy to the extent they have then they just need to kill it. This shit is embarassing."
Gu Family Book,"I've liked a lot of more recent Simpsons, but ""it's good"" in a way like a spin-off or something is good. It's not the bizarre, Family Guy influenced slapstick shit it has been, but even as someone who's been enjoying it more now than I have in years, it's not going to be **as** good as it was ever again."
Gu Family Book,">When the show has been going on so long that they feel the need to develop Comic Book Guy to the extent they have

I sorta feel like if you think there's a tier-list of Simpsons characters that determines who should and shouldn't be explored in a writer's room, that's kind of a limiting viewpoint. 

If developing a show about the Comic-Book Guy leads to quality jokes/storytelling, especially this far into the run, then fuck it. It shouldn't be automatically out of bounds for no other reason than Comic-Book Guy (a fictional cartoon character) doesn't ""deserve"" it. Like it's ""beneath"" them somehow."
Gu Family Book,I remember similar complaints years ago when the cat lady had an episode about her. I think the same thing happened with Hans Moleman as well.
Gu Family Book,I actually really enjoyed this episode until we got to CBG's family.
Gu Family Book,You seem like a nice person
Gu Family Book,"> but ""it's good"" in a way like a spin-off or something is good

That's a terrible analogy. There's so many fantastic spin-offs - Frasier, Maude, The Simpsons at one point, Boston Legal, Family Matters."
Gu Family Book,"> If developing a show about the Comic-Book Guy leads to quality jokes/storytelling, especially this far into the run, then fuck it. It shouldn't be automatically out of bounds for no other reason than Comic-Book Guy (a fictional cartoon character) doesn't ""deserve"" it.

I think that's a fair position, but I don't think it applies well to this scene. Was I supposed to be laughing at him being neglected? Making Comic-Book Guy have a tragic back story doesn't add anything to the character for me. If anything it detracts from the character and the humor around him. Instead of being a nerdy know-it-all dick, he's now just unloved and exhibiting a defense mechanism. 

There are a lot of ways to develop characters that might not ""deserve"" the development. I don't think this is an effective use of that."
Gu Family Book,"I'm sorry but no, I don't watch the Simpsons to see Comic Book Guy get married and have some dorky kid. I quit watching the show specifically because they kept doing these ""references for the sake of references"" shit that's in this clip and it hasn't changed, they just moved on to tertiary characters because the main ones have been storied to death."
Gu Family Book,Hans Moleman has more origin stories than The Joker.
Gu Family Book,"Duffman got one a few weeks ago

Turns out, he’s a very bad father. Aubrey plaza voiced his daughter"
Gu Family Book,Lol you determine whether someone is nice by whether they like new episodes of The Simpsons or not? Makes sense...
Gu Family Book,It's a great analogy in that I'm trying to equate it to a good show that's nevertheless noticeably different from the original.
Gu Family Book,One can criticize without being toxic. Then too most things deserve a deeper look than 4 minutes.
Gu Family Book,"I really enjoyed this miniseries back in the day - and it's what I always remember James Mcevoy for, before Wanted and the Baby X-Men movies.

Good god was the actress playing Alia attractive."
Gu Family Book,"The 2000’s were a golden age on the sci-fi channel.  CG was advanced enough to pull off incredible (at the time) effects and people still watched cable TV.  I loved this miniseries at the time and would look for it whenever they ran it as a marathon.

Ian McNeise as the [Barron](https://youtu.be/nlVEJ3Z8UMQ) was my favorite part.  He brings an almost Shakespearean tone to the role."
Gu Family Book,"I saw the original miniseries at 12 yo and was amazed by the story. It introduced me to sci Fi, my favorite literary genre to this day. These productions despite of its flaws are very good at translating the story and definitely worth the watch. Bonus, the costumes are crazy and amazing!"
Gu Family Book,"Depending on how Dune: Part 2 does, I wonder if Warner Brothers will take a crack at the other parts of the story."
Gu Family Book,"A big improvement over the first mini-series in just about every way.

If anyone is curious I think it is available on Hoopla, which you can access through many public libraries.

I remember really enjoying it, but the thing I remember most is this badass scene with Stilgar.

>Fremen : They say the price on your head keeps going up.
>
>Stilgar : Then I say unto you, send men to summon WORMS! And we shall go to Arrakeen to collect."
Gu Family Book,"Mostly a pretty faithful adaptation (I seem to remember in the book Leto throwing a door and Alia jumping out of a window, both of which I think were missing from the miniseries). Still got it on DVD."
Gu Family Book,"I remember watching this when it premiered. I didn't care for the first mini series, but this was a lot better and McAvoy was fantastic. Also, it had a great soundtrack."
Gu Family Book,Vittorio Storaro being the cinematographer on these is the most inexplicable thing ever
Gu Family Book,"Oh man, could you imagine a Sci-Fi Channel production of God Emperor of Dune? Hahaaaa that’d be somethin’ alright. Now I’m kinda sad we never got to see James McAvoy’s face sticking out of a big rubber Jabba the Hut suit."
Gu Family Book,"I started watching it, but got annoyed when Leto II showed up in the first episode, when in the books Paul doesn't realize there were gonna be twins until the end of the book, and doesn't foresee Leto II, I think? Doesn't really matter, anymore, will have to give it another shot."
Gu Family Book,"Quite enjoyed this adaptation, I thought it was an improvement over the original Dune miniseries. A 56 year-old Susan Sarandon (Wensicia) playing the sister of 29 year old Julie Cox (Irulan) was a hilarious stretch though."
Gu Family Book,"If the new movies make it to God Emperor, I’d love James McAvoy to come back as Leto II."
Gu Family Book,"Loved both the first and the second mini series, they were quite well-written and to the point"
Gu Family Book,The music is the best thing about this miniseries. The montage where all the conspirators are being rounded up and murdered is incredible.
Gu Family Book,Does anyone know if it’s possible to watch the Taken miniseries somewhere?
Gu Family Book,"I've watched this miniseries more times than I can count.

Snaggle-toothed James McAvoy is hot.

One of my favourite scenes is the 'burial' of the traitorous priest. Probably due to what I believe is a montage with a good soundtrack happening during that scene."
Gu Family Book,"I was like ""oh man, the first time I saw James McAvoy, this mini series ruled""!"
Gu Family Book,"Truth. He was really fucking awesome in that role. Just barking these long, theatrical ranting monologues to giant empty rooms when he is ostensibly talking either to himself or one other person, sometimes unconscious. He really went for it. Some parts of both of those miniseries age for the better or the worse, but there are elements that hit dead on, too."
Gu Family Book,"Villeneuve has said he wants to do Dune Messiah too so we likely get a trilogy from him. And there is the spin-off show. Not sure what the rest will be, the later books are harder to adapt (they get weird) and Villeneuve isn't as interested (of course they can continue without him)"
Gu Family Book,"It may be changed from the book, but in the show he /is/ surprised by the twins."
Gu Family Book,"I caught this as a teenager and I still have the DVD somewhere.

The actor playing Korba sold the living hell out of that scene. Resisting when he's being dragged, damn near shitting himself in terror when he realizes what they're going to do to him, to the shot of him still screaming as they close the death still. Easily the best part of that sequence outside of the music.

""Time to settle accounts"""
Gu Family Book,I really hope Villeneuve doesn't tone down the themes from Messiah. There a reason Herbert used the word Jihad and not 'holly war'.
Gu Family Book,"Spin off show is still a go?

The bene gesserit one?"
Gu Family Book,"Been watching it. Certainly are a lot of changes that are understandable (ages of the kids and alia, for example), and really wish that they included things like Ghanima and Leto talking to each other as Chani and Paul, as well that Ghanima saw that Leto was alive and used her psychic abilities to convince herself he was dead. Just felt like they missed out on representing how astounding, and oddly terrifying, the twins were, being pre-born. They used various languages with each other, were constantly cryptic around those around them, etc."
Gu Family Book,">Spin off show is still a go?

I wouldn't hold my breath on that one. Technically it's still a go at the moment but they recently lost the director/showrunner and one of the lead Harkonnen sisters

Given how many other things have been scrapped by Warner Bros/HBO/Discovery - I'd bet the Sisterhood never sees the light of day, but who knows... maybe"
Gu Family Book,That must be terrifying honestly. Coogan is probably one of the most talented impersonators perhaps ever - imagine meeting him dressed up as your abuser.
Gu Family Book,The BBC can go fuck themselves. They protected him for decades and facilitated in the destruction of children.
Gu Family Book,"The audacity of the BBC to make this programme when they were his biggest protectors. It is unspoken that Jimmy Savile was barred from the BBC Scotland, instead of doing something about it, they all just swept it under the carpet and will now profit from it."
Gu Family Book,"“Hoodwinked a nation”.  No he didn’t, he and other presenters were aided and abetted by many others including staff at the BBC, and members of the police.  PR-washing at its best."
Gu Family Book,"Jimmy makes for an easy 'bogeyman' taking the focus away from others who were complicit in abuse, and covering up abuse, at the time.

Though I do believe too much is made of the King's past 'friendship' with him. The fact remains, Jimmy did a crazy amount for charity. It excuses nothing (maybe in his own twisted mind, it somehow did), but it explains why there was ever any royal connection. Very few have done more for charitable causes than Charles himself. I'll never believe there was any more to it than that."
Gu Family Book,"Reminder that Jimmy Savile was an unofficial advisor and confidant of then Prince Charles

>""Nobody will ever know what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that.

The Royal Family was close to Savile, there is ZERO possibility they were unaware of the allegations.   

Prince Andrew was close with Jeff Epstein, Prince Charles was close with Jimmy Savile, it isn't too tough to figure out why Epstein and Savile basically got away with their crimes"
Gu Family Book,"There’s no way anybody gets that close to the Royal Family and Prime Ministers without being thoroughly investigated, so MI5 must either be the most inept intelligence service on the planet, or they knew exactly what he was up to, did nothing and helped cover up."
Gu Family Book,"Omg I did not know this was in the works!

Interested in how this turns out 

Really enjoyed the BBC's Early Days of Doctor Who television movie; this is, of course, a horse of a much different color"
Gu Family Book,It's been shelved for the time being. Even the BBC can't be that naive?
Gu Family Book,"If anyone needs eye bleach after this, check out the dueling Michael Cain impressions between Coogan and Rob Brydon in “The Trip.”"
Gu Family Book,"This wouldn't have been the first time a comedian has dressed up like Saville and put on the voice. Way back before the news broke to the public, Saville was often the subject for mimicry, mostly in earnest too."
Gu Family Book,The BBC enabled and abetted him.  They helped him molest children.
Gu Family Book,"I mean, how many people who did that are still at the BBC now? It's not a living being, it's an organization."
Gu Family Book,"And the crown.  He was one of Chuckle's best friends.

And it's oh so convenient that they've moved the show to after the coronation."
Gu Family Book,"It’s like being the person who threw gasoline on a burning house, then coming back when the house had burnt down and talking about how terrible the whole thing was."
Gu Family Book,"This is the truth *right there* not only that, any Brits that grew up in the 70's are righfully shook up about it as he was everywhere in their childhoods and just hearing his voice and seeing pictures of him from that time is unnerving.

And to top it off, they take our money in the form of mandated subscription through the TV license, then spend it on a fucking TV show so we can get horrified about it all over again, while making sure they dont look too badly out of it?"
Gu Family Book,That's what I can't believe! How on Earth will they address this?
Gu Family Book,"The UK’s power structures have been uniquely influenced and shaped by child abuse, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the systems built end up protecting the abusers."
Gu Family Book,"This is what this ‘drama’ is designed to do. Minimize the BBC’s culpability and part in anything. Minimize the Royal Family’s culpability and part in anything. Play up the notion that ‘no one could’ve known’ and ‘mistakes were made’, while ultimately laying all blame squarely on Savile.

Meanwhile the BBC will laud this thing praising the acting and ‘Coogan’s spine chilling performance’, throw a BAFTA at this whitewashing of reality when it comes time and they’ll have their fake version of events firmly implanted in the UK’s mind."
Gu Family Book,"Blows my mind. Shows you how pathetic the BBC is. Guy was literally groping girls on TOTP LIVE on air. They all knew and did nothing.

At least come forward with a proper public apology before making a show. Or even invest a substantial amount of money into charities against child abuse. If it wasn't already free, I'd recommend everyone to pirate this."
Gu Family Book,How many people currently at the BBC would have been around for any of that? Let alone in power?
Gu Family Book,This is like if O.J. Simpson did a television special where he goes looking for the real killers
Gu Family Book,Their cover up was disgusting but maybe its a move of atonement?
Gu Family Book,"Yeah, that was my first thought as well.

First they profit from him and cover up his abuses, then they profit from a show about his crimes and how they were covered up.

I wonder if the show will explicitly show BBC's involvement.

Edit:My brain is fried today and my writing was ugly as fuck."
Gu Family Book,Also Maggie Thatcher.
Gu Family Book,The man was seen as trusted enough by the British public that British Rail used him for TV adverts.
Gu Family Book,"I think the problem for Charlies is that he is connected not just to this guy, but to his brother Andrew and Epstein. Now, granted, if you actually look into it, he didn't visit Epstein really without Andrew and his visits pretty quickly fell off as time went on, but these are still connections he is never going to quite be able to shake."
Gu Family Book,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/friendship-with-prince-charles-made-paedophile-bishop-peter-ball-impregnable
Gu Family Book,That's what I was thinking after viewing the doc. There's NO WAY this guy's secret life could have been contained without outside help covering it up. And like you say esp with ther Royal Family it would seem.
Gu Family Book,"MI5 allowed a confessed Soviet double agent to take an immunity deal, end up in charge of the royal art collection and get a knighthood."
Gu Family Book,"Everyone of any significance in the British Establishment who came into frequent contact with Savile would have been briefed on the allegations, and the likelihood that MI5 believed them to be true."
Gu Family Book,"dude, read the room 😂"
Gu Family Book,It says in the article that you're commenting on that it's not been shelved and looking like a summer premiere.
Gu Family Book,Has anyone actually watched more of the show than that clip? lol
Gu Family Book,"""Yeah, it probably goes 'Hi My Name Is Michael Cain'"""
Gu Family Book,You say that as if the BBC isn't one of the most incestuous media organizations filled with nepotistic legacy hires on earth.
Gu Family Book,[removed]
Gu Family Book,"Soooo, like every US movie about Vietnam?"
Gu Family Book,It's not though is it. Most the people working at the BBC wouldn't have been there in the 70s to early/mid 90s where he was regularly working
Gu Family Book,"Nothing will happen if you simply stop paying for the TV licence, as so many other people have done"
Gu Family Book,How dare drama tackle heavy subjects. It should keep to its lane and do marvel lunchbox commercials.
Gu Family Book,"Hey! I remember him clearly as a child all through the 80’s, thank you very much."
Gu Family Book,Just look at the culture of elite British boarding schools and universities. [Ritualized sexual abuse and humilliation](https://nypost.com/2015/09/21/david-cameron-put-private-part-in-dead-pigs-mouth-book/) is a stable of English aristocratic culture.
Gu Family Book,"Not free. TV licence required to watch, unlike the coronation which I as a non-licence holder can watch without threat of prosecution. Savile made me abandon the BBC, and later all UK broadcast TV since the weaponisation if racism, immigration, and anti-semitism."
Gu Family Book,"There was an apology. What else are you going to blame them for, your crap memory?"
Gu Family Book,">*They all knew*

Yeah? Who, exactly? Name names"
Gu Family Book,Reminds me of a guy who was on TV when I was a kid here in Canada. I think the show was called Just Like Mom or something similar and the host’s name was Fergie Olver. Many times he coerced or tricked 10-12 year old girls into kissing him live on air. Totally revolting and he’s never faced any backlash for it.
Gu Family Book,Vanishingly small.
Gu Family Book,"There's a Norm MacDonald joke in there somewhere, I can feel it."
Gu Family Book,Atonement is a funny word for exploitation and greed.
Gu Family Book,They don’t profit from the show at all.
Gu Family Book,And the royal family.
Gu Family Book,I’ve always been partial to the [James Bond improvisation](https://youtu.be/XTEL976wc_I) where Rob starts off by playing the Roger Moore role but instantly realizes that Steve does a phenomenal Moore voice so they switch it up
Gu Family Book,"It’s a movie with a sequel, and I watched both! This is just an extremely fun clip of two masters who have a history in real life squabbling and being excellent at what they do, and that you need basically no plot and info to understand."
Gu Family Book,"Okay, and if someone's uncle covered for a pedophile that means they will too?"
Gu Family Book,[removed]
Gu Family Book,You know the pig story isn't actually true though. That was just put out there by Lord Ashcroft. It's a perfect case of the whole make up something so salacious that even to deny would be embarrassing.
Gu Family Book,"For a start, here's a couple of names from [the Dame Janet Smith Review Report](http://downloads.bbci.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/our_work/dame_janet_smith_review/savile/jimmy_savile_investigation.pdf):

* Ted Beston, Radio 1 producer — he not only knew, but on at least one occasion ""was willing to act as a provider of a young woman for Savile""
* Canon Colin Semper, producer in the religious broadcasting department 
* Douglas Muggeridge, Former Controller of Radio 1 and Radio 2

There's also George Entwistle, Director-General of the BBC in 2012, who shut down the Newsnight investigation into Savile."
Gu Family Book,[removed]
Gu Family Book,"I think I saw a compilation video of this a while back. Terrible but Savile was a different kind of beast. He sexually molested children in their hospital beds (yes, really). The information is all out there, just Google it if you're brave enough. He got off on the savagery. Pure unadulterated evil."
Trailer Park Boys,"One of my favourite throw away jokes in TPB is when Ricky asks Corey and Trevor to pick up zesty mordant chips.

Doritos had a zesty flavour chip and in Canada we have two official languages, so we have to have both English and French on our packaging. So right below zesty it says mordant which is the French equivalent I guess.

I only even knew about those chips because we stocked them at the video store I worked at.

I love it because the joke probably just flew past most people but works perfectly for Ricky who doesn't seem to understand the delineation between English and French on packaging."
Trailer Park Boys,I think it's in the deleted scenes when lahey and randy roll the car and hes tryin to drink liquor while upside down and just pouring booze all over himself.  He says some like wull cutem off at the pass!  And proceeds to roll the car.  Fuckin hilarious.
Trailer Park Boys,"""Bottle kids!"""
Trailer Park Boys,"No one wants to admit they ate 9 cans of ravioli. But you have one, and sometimes you just can’t stop."
Trailer Park Boys,John Dunsworth RIP
Trailer Park Boys,"I was hooked when I saw the title to the second episode was “Fuck community college, let’s get drunk and eat chicken fingers”"
Trailer Park Boys,"Favorite clip ever:

https://youtu.be/M1WQx3J8xJw

“I was changin’ gnomesayin’”"
Trailer Park Boys,"Fun fact. A year or so before Dunsworth died he and Randy were driving around my home town looking for a Chinese food buffet. Pulled up next to my friend and had him roll down the window and asked where the Chinese buffet was. My buddy was dumbfounded he didn’t know what to say he just responded with “Lahey??… Randy?” To which Dunsworth replied with “yeah that’s us, where’s the buffet!?” My friend pointed and off they drove. All while at a red light.

I think about that moment and how my buddy was so hysterical from laughing he couldn’t believe it was real. They were even driving a shitty tan car

Edit: another Redditor said I should include the fact that Randy was shirtless lol. It was a hot day."
Trailer Park Boys,Fuckin way she goes
Trailer Park Boys,IM MOWING THE AIR RANDY!
Trailer Park Boys,"Can you read, my son? Well that depends. Can you go fuck yourself?"
Trailer Park Boys,"Unleaded tastes a little tangy. Supreme is kinda sour, and diesel tastes pretty good."
Trailer Park Boys,"It’s all water under the fridge, boys!"
Trailer Park Boys,Rip John Dunsworth. I wish the show could keep going on how it was but it never can continue without Mr. Lahey
Trailer Park Boys,Happy birthday you greasy cocksuckers. Tell that gurgling cheeseburger eating bastard Randy hi too
Trailer Park Boys,Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!
Trailer Park Boys,Smokes
Trailer Park Boys,"Seasons 1-7 are some comedy genius and gold. So are the first three movies and the christmas special.

&#x200B;

The hardest this show ever made me laugh was (i think season 7) where Ray (who is drunk) and someone else are driving down the road having a conversation. the camera is in wide shot and as they are speaking, they crash into a tree and completely fuck up the passenger door. I was so surprised i cried laughing for like 30 mins.

&#x200B;

I prefer to think that every thing that happened after season 7 just doesn't exist though.  Ah well. Good memories."
Trailer Park Boys,Barb your scallop potatoes are fucked!
Trailer Park Boys,Time to get drunk and eat chicken fingers.
Trailer Park Boys,"""Bacon frying and the sparrows are chirping buddy.""  


""The fuck you talkin about?""  


""Sparrows in the bible buddy, nothing to worry about, I'm not worried, sparrows aren't worried""  


""Sparrows are stupid dad, they don't give a fuck about anything"""
Trailer Park Boys,"I was surprised to see a TPB article from Jacobin of all sources, but I think it did a good job at situating the show in context of its time."
Trailer Park Boys,Randy and Lahey were the power couple we needed but did not deserve. RIP Dunsworth
Trailer Park Boys,"i think to this day, i must have watched it 3-4 times. not the Netflix ones though because they're not as good.

my favorite bit is still Ricky not knowing how to pronounce Jalapeno. cracks me up every time."

Trailer Park Boys,A Canadian Classic
Trailer Park Boys,"Stumbling surreptitiously on this show on a weird channel on DirecTV in 2007 or so was like finding the world's biggest gold nugget. It was on Friday nights for like four hours straight. I had just got their DVR too, and it was filled with TPB. Great times."
Trailer Park Boys,DEEEeeEEeeEeecent!
Trailer Park Boys,"Apparently they had a livestream for it that was like 5 hours long and they were all drunk as fuck, which is all anyone could ask for"
Trailer Park Boys,"I know it's kind of a joke on the show, but the bisexual representation on this show is legit!!

Also, this show and the Office UK paved the way for mockumentary down the road. One of the most underrated shows of all time that gets ignored by most people outside the internet."
Trailer Park Boys,“I fucking toad a so.”
Trailer Park Boys,"Ricky : Why aren't you watching the dope plants, you asshole?
Julian : Calm down Ricky, I'm just grabbing some take-out.
Ricky : Take-out my ass, looks to me like you're on a date with cinnamon-roll-fuckin-head."
Trailer Park Boys,Shit hawks
Trailer Park Boys,"The episode where Ricky is trying to get locked up made me cry. Omg it was so crazy, funny, especially at the closed police station. OMG!"
Trailer Park Boys,I feel personally attacked by the number of years cited in the post title.
Trailer Park Boys,RIP DUNSWORTH
Trailer Park Boys,Even the Red Blue Green cocksucker wasn't on TV that long
Trailer Park Boys,"First saw the show at 3am on Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK. It was the episode where Bubble’s has an infected tooth and they need Conky to help them. 

Quickly became obsessed and watched every episode, the movies and saw them live twice. 

When I saw them live the 2nd time, there was a hot chick selling ice cream, got her number, banged for a while (sadly not behind the muffler shop) but it quickly fizzled out.

Fuckin way she goes, boys."
Trailer Park Boys,"I got to see Randy and Lahey in KS right before Lahey passed. Was a solid live show and some really, really attractive girl got me out of my mind drunk, made out with me and then I never saw her again. Overall it was a super cool experience"
Trailer Park Boys,"The title is actually 'birthday', but the automod removes anything with that in its title."
Trailer Park Boys,My wife doesn't understand why I watch this show. Neither do I but I'm not stopping.
Trailer Park Boys,Damn they have brought me so much joy! Thanks boys!
Trailer Park Boys,"I started watching this show in 2004 or 2005 I think.  Was living in a one room apartment with a roommate in Asheville, NC trying to finish college.  We had a tiny TV and VCR and had to agree on what we were going to watch when we were both there.  There was a mom & pop video rental store down the street and we found some TPB there and decided to watch because it looked so stupid.  Hooked immediately and I ended up spreading it to all my buddies in town and next thing you know, everyone was loving some TPB that I knew.  I'd show up to a buddy's house and they'd be watching it.  When foiks give it a chance they tend to get hooked quick.

Got to meet the boys back in 2010 or 2011 I think when they did a live show in Tampa.  Paid the merch guy $50 to go back after the show and get a photo with them.  They were awesome."

Trailer Park Boys,"It came as a shock to me that the actor who plays bubbles is kinda douchy irl. His on stage persona is the complete opposite.

https://pagesix.com/2016/04/02/bubbles-from-trailer-park-boys-arrested-for-domestic-battery/"
Trailer Park Boys,Love that show! I still watch it on Netflix.
Trailer Park Boys,Top 3 show of all time
Trailer Park Boys,Worst case Ontario
Trailer Park Boys,"The first ""film"" was in 1999, this doesn't computerate, Bubbles."
Trailer Park Boys,Knock knock. Whos there . Fuck off lahey
Trailer Park Boys,"My favorite TPB moment is when Bubbles, disgusted by Ray's urine containers, hurls one behind himself... you just see it slowly arc and then explode when it hits a windshield. So fucking hilarious."
Trailer Park Boys,"“Nah, I want some of Jimmy’s water cuz that’s the kind that’ll get you FUCKIN’ DRUNK isn’t that right, Jimmy?”"
Trailer Park Boys,"Frig off, Barb."
Trailer Park Boys,[deleted]
Trailer Park Boys,Greasy bastards.
Trailer Park Boys,Fuck community college. Let’s get drunk and eat chicken fingers.
Trailer Park Boys,It’s water under the fridge.
Trailer Park Boys,"Green Bastard, parts unknown"
Trailer Park Boys,It’s like climbing up a shit rope Ricky.
Trailer Park Boys,and now they make the best weed for its price in Canada !! Fkin eh boys ..u did it
Trailer Park Boys,Who’s got your belly
Trailer Park Boys,Favorite part of this show was when they where in the river between USA and Canada and Ricky starts deciding which countries gonna be easier in jail
Trailer Park Boys,"My favorite is how the show makes it seem like Julian is the only sane one with half a brain but if you really think about it, the only time Ricky ever seems to get his act together is when Julian's in jail. Then, Julian gets out and gets everybody involved in some hare-brained get-rich-quick scheme which without fail goes awry and results in everybody's lives being more fucked up than they were by the end of the season.

It's pretty clear by the end that Ricky is just fucking better off without Julian. Ricky might not be a well-educated guy but he knows what he's good at and what his limits are. Whenever Julian isnt around he becomes more successful and responsible. Then Julian shows up with another pie-in-the-sky idea and beats Ricky down until Ricky finally relents and without fail fucks it up. And sure, Ricky does fuck up a lot but 99% of the time it's in the course of doing something Julian put him up to.

Ricky just wants to have a good family, sell some weed, and get high. Julian's always fucking that up. Fuck Julian."
Trailer Park Boys,"My favorite gag from this show is when Julian gets out of jail and comes back to his trailer, only to find that Ricky, Corey, and Trevor have removed all the furniture and coated the inside of the trailer with aluminum foil so they can use it as a pot farm, and when Ricky offers to take it all down Julian just says “no leave it up, I like it” with no other explanation, and for the entire rest of the season the inside of julians trailer is just coated in foil and he sleeps on the floor with no mattress."
Trailer Park Boys,"Holy shitballs Randy, 20th Anniversary....I'm old as fuck."
Trailer Park Boys,"Excellent. Now please let it die, yall are turning into the Simpsons."
Trailer Park Boys,If your a fan and want something from Eastern Canada along similar lines check out just passing through on YouTube. Really good and underrated
Trailer Park Boys,Anybody need any clean piss?
Trailer Park Boys,"Damn, only 20?  I feel like they've been around longer."
Trailer Park Boys,"Canadian classic, makes me proud to be Canadian."
Trailer Park Boys,Grea-he-heasy!
Trailer Park Boys,My favorite show! RIP to Lahey and the Mustard Tiger
Trailer Park Boys,It was great until they brought snoop dogg in. That was the beginning of the end
Trailer Park Boys,I am the liquor.
Trailer Park Boys,"One thing I never got: they're in Nova Scotia and besides the one-off Christmas special, there are no episodes with snow on the ground. Was this simply a production choice and they didn't want to shoot in the snow? I suppose it could also be a problem for continuity. Just seems like snow-based antics would be a whole extra well of plot material."
Trailer Park Boys,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMM
Trailer Park Boys,"What are you staring at my gut fer?
I was just reading where it said Vancouver!"
Trailer Park Boys,The very early seasons of this show are just absolutely brilliant. Art.
Trailer Park Boys,"I wish The Drunk and on Drugs Happy fun time hour had made more than one season.

It wasnt the masterpiece that season 1-7 tpb, but fuck that show was funny, [the meat pirates!](https://youtu.be/syLqkN8S8OI)"
Trailer Park Boys,"Smokes, let's go !"
Trailer Park Boys,"HAVE ANOTHER DRINK, RAAYYY!


“Mr. Lahey do you want me to wear this shirt because you’re embarrassed of me?

Of course not Ran, you’re beautiful.”

“Randy are you out here sellin yourself for cheeseburgers again? 

Mans gotta eat”"
Trailer Park Boys,"“Swayze Train’s comin’ with us, gentlemen!”"
Trailer Park Boys,"“You lied to the guy in the chair Rick, you lied to the guy in the chair”"
Trailer Park Boys,RIP JOHN DUNSWORTH AKA JIM LAHEY
Trailer Park Boys,“Hear that Rand? It’s the whistling winds of a shit storm.”
Trailer Park Boys,"Still my favorite music video of all time! Bubbles with Rush... 

https://youtu.be/rs4qn_bHQQ0"
Trailer Park Boys,I am the liquor
Trailer Park Boys,"Picked my username after Ray.

“Fucking way she goes boys.”"
Trailer Park Boys,"The way she goes, boys."
Trailer Park Boys,My favorite show of all time!! They coming to my city in December and im gunna see them live for the first time! Honestly im just happy they still doin this shit..
Trailer Park Boys,Best fucking shower ever
Trailer Park Boys,"Way she goes boys,way she goes"
Trailer Park Boys,"I recently discovered “People Just Do Nothin”. If you love TPB, you will probably like that show too!"
Trailer Park Boys,Crazy cheeseburger and liquor party tonight
Trailer Park Boys,"When people ask why I have my bbq chained up, I always respond with, ‘have you ever watched TPB? That’s where im from’"
Trailer Park Boys,Decent
Trailer Park Boys,There’s a shit storm a-brewin…..
Trailer Park Boys,I binged this show last year and stopped when they got out of prison after the smuggling into the US shit. I hear I probably stopped at the right place....and have no intentions on going further in.
Trailer Park Boys,"I’m making an apples to oranges comparison a bit here, but I loved TPB. It was comically much more nuanced than its title insinuates, had lots of heartfelt moments too over the years. Yeah it could be dumb and the later seasons (Netflix era) weren’t as good….but it was overall great. 

I’ve TRIED hard with Letterkenny, and it’s funny but just not the same. I understand it’s not meant to be the same show, at all. But as far as an American watching shows based in and about Canada…TPB is tops. I don’t count Schitt’s Creek bc while made in and using mostly Canadian actors it could have taken place in any small town, USA. Few is any Canadian references. And I’ve spent a decent amount of time in Canada, so I’m not foreign to the references…"
Bob the Builder,Where the fuck is Roley
Bob the Builder,"As much I enjoy CGI, I wish they didn't go that route with Bob the builder, the claymation was a major part of the show's charm imo"
Bob the Builder,[deleted]
Bob the Builder,"Boob the Builder?


Titty the Tailor?


Breast the Bouncer?"
Bob the Builder,"Those endings don't really sound very similar to me...?

On a random vaguely related note, I do think part of [The Gummy Bear Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=astISOttCQ0&t=31s) and [Bad Guy by Billie Eilish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI&t=74s) sound similar and I've never seen anyone else mention that."
Bob the Builder,"Really, not at all? Drew Carey and Bob the Builder are identical to me (the riff, not the Ohio bit obvs).

That 70s show sounded right in my head but I'll admit that one is off. Still a slight resemblance in the last four notes of the riff imo."
Bob the Builder,How'd you forget static shock? 
Bob the Builder,"Since the majority of reddit are probably the ages that grew up with these shows (like me) People are going say yes because of nostalgia.

I'm sure when the current kids are grown up, they will be posting reddit posts ""The thundermans and Stuck in the middle"" were the best kids sitcoms.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
Bob the Builder,"The lack of Superman: TAS, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, KaBlam!, and The Angry Beavers is very upsetting."
Bob the Builder,"These are just things we grew up with and enjoyed. There have been plenty of fantastic shows for kids over the last 15 years. There's also been garbage, and there was also plenty of garbage back then. "
Bob the Builder,Bobby's World? Ran for seven seasons on Fox Kids. 
Bob the Builder,"As a child of the 80’s I’m biased. Transformers, GI JOE, MASK, Ghostbusters, He-Man, TMNT, Ducktales, Thundercats, Voltron, and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research. "
Bob the Builder,Indeed. Was lucky enough to have access in Australia to some of these shows.
Bob the Builder,"I might extend it a few years to include Avatar: The Last Air Bender, the original Ben 10, and Naruto. 

Outside of that, kid cartoons haven't been entertaining me or popular for kids. I know I'm not a kid, but I'd want shows that I could sit back and at least be entertained by if I am with some younger cousins that they actually know. "
Bob the Builder,"Yeah, you guys certainly lucked out. When I was growing up Disney cartoons were basically ""you like ducks? Here's some ducks. Did you like those ducks? Here's some other ducks."" Non-Disney stuff was just long toy commercials or mind-fucks like Heathcliff."
Bob the Builder,"X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman TAS, all at the same time?

Kids will never have it that good again. What song today could ever reach the quality of the X-men intro?"
Bob the Builder,"Yes it was. Well, in actuality the Golden Age is 1991 - 2003.

There are always going to be outliers that make people assume the real dates are some amalgamation of a 20-something year period but I argue those 12 years were the true golden age because it was a constant influx of quality that was bookended by important events. The forming of Cartoon Network to air the cartoons from the original golden age and Nickelodeon airing their first NickToon; all the way until the corporate crash and burn of the early-to-mid 2000s.

---
Nickelodeon under Warner had been an exclusively kids television channel since 1979; [let's just say it hadn't quite figured things out just yet.] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Nicklogoiozzi79.jpg) They were operating at loss with shows they now pretend don't exist anymore. They hired the guys who made MTV iconic to spruce up the Network, [which they accomplished exceptionally well] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAIX96v1mI) and in 1986 they were sold to Viacom. Under Viacom, Nickelodeon began their rise, first with the original Kid's Choice Awards and then by airing Nick Jr. during school hours. In 1990 they opened the Nickelodeon Studios where they filmed their early sitcoms and game shows and in 1991 Nicktoons began.

Meanwhile, in 1991, Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and created Cartoon Network. The purpose being to air the tape library he had acquired over the years. Along with Hanna-Barbera, he also owned the MGM cartoon library, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts, as well as Popeye.

There was now true competition in the world of kids-exclusive television. Money was being pumped into it and most importantly creators were given the freedom to experiment and tell good/great stories and be silly within of course the guidelines of Standards and Practices. John Kricfalusi would discover this the hard way when his popular masterpiece 'Ren and Stimpy' was cancelled for going too far.

Eight years of near perfection. 

Then within a two year period two cataclysmic events happened. Firstly, in 1999 Spongebob Squarepants happened and it was the most popular cartoon ever made and its merchandise alone became omnipresent. Nickelodeon became oddly complacent and out of touch after this. In 2005 Viacom split into two companies marking a definitive end and you can see it in their release line-up.

The second big cataclysmic event was that in 2001, Turner merged with AOL to become AOL TimeWarner which many consider to be the greatest financial blunder in history. Jamie Kellner headed the company and while it seemed reasonable at the time given he was the guy that made Fox a legitimate fourth network and made WB the who's who of cult classic television. However in 2001, Kellner cancelled everything from WCW to Animaniacs to Batman: TAS in favor of shows he wanted to see. Again, this is the guy who is responsible for The Simpsons, Beverly Hills 90210, Married... with Children, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Charmed and the NFL being on Fox, maybe he knew what he was doing.

In 2003, the AOL TimeWarner experiment had officially crashed and burned. TimeWarner dropped AOL from their name and everything was swept under the carpet. They say that without Turner and his stubbornness (and his finance department working the books) many of his crazy, money losing ideas would have been done away with quickly. Once he was out of the company, that ended up being true. WCW was cancelled immediately. CNN was always sensational but with him gone, [well... yeah] (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Cartoon Network meanwhile... it was never the same and eventually even started airing non-cartoons.

---
In June 2018, AT&T bought out TimeWarner. As of ~~three~~ two days ago, Turner doesn't even exist.

> On March 4, 2019, AT&T began restructuring WarnerMedia. HBO, TNT, TBS and TruTV were combined into a new entity, WarnerMedia Entertainment.

> WarnerMedia's Otter Media and Turner's Turner Classic Movies, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and Boomerang became part of Warner Bros. 

> CNN, HLN, Turner Sports, Bleacher Report and AT&T Regional Sports Networks were consolidated under newly-formed WarnerMedia News & Sports.

There will never be another golden age."
Bob the Builder,"I dunno. I guess I'm kind of biased being born near the end of that era, but the 2010s had some really good stuff as well, if not, even better. Of course, this is opinion, and you're free to disagree, but we've had:

Adventure Time

Steven Universe

Star Vs the Forces of Evil

Gravity Falls

Over the Garden Wall

Star Wars: The Clone Wars

The Amazing World of Gumball

Not even to mention the adult cartoons Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman.

Sure, there is probably less quantity overall, so you could definitely argue against this era, but quite a lot of these shows are just as good, if not even better than a lot of the shows that you listed.

Again, just my opinion."
Bob the Builder,"You're wrong, it was (insert decade when I was a kid)."
Bob the Builder,I downloaded them and my kids love whatever I show em
Bob the Builder,"Naw-1970's man!

HR Pufnstuf-witchipoo, Sigmund the Sea Monster, Electra Woman & Dyna girl, Dr Shrinker, & my personal favorite Land of the Lost"
Bob the Builder,"Good times, good times."
Bob the Builder,"All those were important shows, but in a way Ren & Stimpy seems to be to be slightly more important - because it specifically brought back the Golden Age style of animation from the 1940s and 1950s. 

Among the current generation of animators, John Kricfalusi is a major influence. "
Bob the Builder,"No because then you're missing out on Dragon Ball, Inspector Gadget, Trap Door, M.A.S.K., The Raccoons and many more that were around in the 80s.

I'd say 1984-2002, personally."
Bob the Builder,"I think there's been a recent renaissance in serialized children's programming. I honestly would put recent shows like Steven Universe, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, and others well over the likes of shows that have come before it, and I have watched pretty much every show on this list (though some moreso than others)."
Bob the Builder,Every generation thinks what they grew up with were the best.
Bob the Builder,Nope totally wrong.  The 80's was the best time to be a kid and we had the best shows
Bob the Builder,Cow and Chicken and Dexter's Lab are to me  the Citizen Kane of cartoons.
Bob the Builder,"Yes, yes it was"
Bob the Builder,Go Speed Racer! Go Speed Racer GO!!!! 
Bob the Builder,"Don't forget CN used to show a lot of classic scifi action cartoons from the 70s and 80s in it's early days. Centurions, Plastic Man, Dyno Mutt, Space ghost, Godzilla&son, Thundarr,  Jonny Quest,  Birdman, HongKong Phoeey, Inch High Private Eye... "
Bob the Builder,"Pete and Pete, so yes!

By the way, it's not just kids shows.  I don't know if it was 9/11 or what, something just isn't the same anymore."
Bob the Builder,"Every generation has great cartoons. But the 1990-2005 generation had both quantity and quality. For example, Nick, not counting Nick Jr., these days only has Spongebob and Loud house on their schedule most of the time."
Bob the Builder,How could you forget Clarissa Explains It All and Alex Mac?
Bob the Builder,No Darkwing Duck in OP or comments. Fail.
Bob the Builder,Anything that had Looney Tunes was the best. However I was very partial to the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons when I was a kid (in the 80s & 90s).
Bob the Builder,Where the fuck is Ren and Stimpy?!
Bob the Builder,That's a pretty big swath of time though.  
Bob the Builder,You forgot Freakazoid!
Bob the Builder,what about TMNT 2003?
Bob the Builder,"I’d stop it at 2001, but yeah. That era of Cartoon Network is my absolute favourite and it’s really sad to see what it’s turned into."
Bob the Builder,"Nah, it was the 80s

Quality over quantity 

Transformers, TMNT, Ducktales, Chip'n Dale Rescue Rangers, Super Mario Bros, Garfield and Friends"
Bob the Builder,Obviously 
Bob the Builder,"Being in the UK we were lucky and had access to a lot of them through cable TV, and more popular ones shown on regular TV here.

But adding to that list we had Superted, Rupert the Bear, Tintin, Count Duckula and Im sure others would add more greats."
Bob the Builder,I loved live and kicking!
Bob the Builder,"I mean I'll agree especially since I was born on 1995 so 2000-2005 was really my golden era. 

But it also feels like cheating to include such a large range the world and tv was a much different place in 2005 than it was in 1990. It feels like when people want to say the '90's rocked but keep naming things from the '00's because by the ""'90's"" they really mean ""My childhood"" which I suspect is what is happening here. Give me the perimeters why 1990 is the beginning of this ""Era"" and why 2005 is the end. It would be way more interesting you had this list and had to make a case of the 1990's vs the 2000's"
Bob the Builder,Because people were actually creative.
Bob the Builder,"No

Most of them didnt last more than 2 seasons.


Try looking at the era between 1976-1989,the era before cable TV dominance."
Bob the Builder,"Most likely. There was more passion and creativity in those days IMHO. Not sure what the content looks like now, but there is the occasional sleeper every now and then. For me it was 1990-2002 for smart entertainment aimed at young people with some added subversive jokes for adults. Spongebob, Pete and Pete, Hey Arnold, Rockos Modern Life, and Gravity Falls come to mind. Most likely there are clever shows that exist now, but that period of time for me and you will always remain very special."
Bob the Builder,You can stop at 2000 and throw in 1989
Bob the Builder,I would say the 90s. Nothing past 2000 was any good.
Bob the Builder,"I would say yes. 06 and 07 had some pretty good ones too though, like :-

Shuriken School


Emperor's New School


George of the Jungle


Team Galaxy
"
Bob the Builder,Best black super hero
Bob the Builder,Dope af.
Bob the Builder,"The question is essentially ""is my nostalgia the best nostalgia?""

Also, intentionally casting a wide net by the range of years and *also* throwing in the reruns is guaranteed to net some strong agreement/karma.

And it's literally just a list of shows to get people to reminisce. There is nothing in the OP that is trying to spark a discussion about *what* may have made those shows great, or how they might be different from shows today.

It's a nostalgia/agreement/karma fishing expedition.

I think I'll unsub..."
Bob the Builder,Wrong. I see many of todays kids say that the original Teen Titans is better than Teen Titans Go.
Bob the Builder,"I forgot to put KaBlam! It was a good show, super funny.  Superman on the other hand was okay, it was one of the weakest DCAU shows"
Bob the Builder,And The Adventures of Gummi Bears
Bob the Builder,"The '80s were great. I loved watching USA Cartoon Express as a young child. I caught the tail end of that generation of Saturday morning cartoons in the late '80s/early '90s. 

I grew out of cartoons by the early 2000s so I can't really speak for anything after 2002-2003."
Bob the Builder,[deleted]
Bob the Builder,"No the 80s was absolutely terrible except for a few late 80s/early 90s shows like DuckTales

Cartoons like GI Joe  and Transformers were basically toy ads and not the good type of toy ads like The Lego Movie"
Bob the Builder,"Personally I wouldn't. Most of what came out after 2005 was a notable moon jump in quality away from what came out in the 15 years prior.

Now, I enjoyed Ben10 for what it was and it was fine. Avatar: The Last Airbender debuted in 2005 but I'm willing to not count it as it was right on the border. However Avatar is transcendent and the exception. Hell, it might have been the only great kids show to debut in that post-boom era. Not even Legend of Korra was in the same league (thanks Nickelodeon!)

While I have no love for Naruto, it technically debuted in 2002 and is also Japanese. If we want to talk about Japan, you'll looking at 1980 - 1995 for their Golden Age with a few outliers before and after. Personally I'm not a fan of OP using Toonami as an example given that shows like Dragon Ball were in the realms of 20 years old before we got them.

Point stands that yes, 1990 - 2005 is the golden age of kids shows (in the West)."
Bob the Builder,This is an incredibly informative and interesting reply. Calling it now- it'll be bestof'd within 24 hours.
Bob the Builder,"I mean I’d argue there was a short “light in the dark” period between 2009-13. Adventure Time was the first in a new generation of innovative cartoons, everything from Gravity Falls to Steven Universe to Regular Show to The Amazing World of Gumball... like these shows are all widely enjoyed and critically acclaimed, so we can’t deny their impact. Though there haven’t been any true heavy-hitters for a while I’d say, apart from a handful since the networks aren’t putting their faith in new cartoons as much, unlike how they were with Adventure Time fever. But you are right, it’s not an overwhelmingly solid period of time like the first “golden age” (which had its real stinkers, but like I said, overwhelmingly solid) and more like a group of intelligent, innovative people got given a chance and a platform for once, and that small number of shows was the product"
Bob the Builder,"I'm probably op age and I agree with this. I think shows today have more depth and I enjoy them a lot. I would add Hilda, Avatar, Korra, Chowder and Flapjack too. Right now they seem to go for quality over quantity."
Bob the Builder,from where? I want to download old toons
Bob the Builder,"Issue is that the three shows you mentioned pretty much capture the entire true renaissance though... and that’s literally 4 years. There’s definitely been an uptake in quality over the last decade and with regards to animation the 10s aren’t exactly something to sneeze at for sure. But the very best came out within the first three years, like a dozen exceptions all at once: which, I know, sounds like an oxymoron but over the rest of the decade I can count maybe five more shows that carry any sort of weight, and those five have either been subject to major scheduling abuse and thus have very few episodes or just haven’t been out for a while and thus have very few episodes, so I just can’t call it a trend. "
Bob the Builder,Bucky O'Hare. Philleas Fogg. Bananaman. Henry's Cat.
Bob the Builder,We also got to watch The Raccoons and The Moomins too and The Animals of Farthing Wood on CBBC too.
Bob the Builder,"1990 is the beggining of this era because this is when cartoons such as The Simpsons, Batman TAS (which are regarded as two of the best cartoons ever made) X-men, etc came out. These shows pushed the boundaries of what a cartoon could be. The animation, writing, direction, and quality improved drastically upon cartoons of previous years.

And i put down 2005 as the end of this era because the cartoon landscape changed drastically in the mid- 2000s. Nickelodeon shows such Rocket Power, CatDog, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Wild Thornberrys all ended in 04-05. The Spongebob Movie also came out in November 2004 and everyone agrees that the best era of Spongebob was everything before the movie. On Cartoon Network shows such as Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo, Samurai Jack, Teen Titans, Justice League all ended in the mid 2000s. Toonami was also moved to one day a week during this time.

Also, by the mid 2000s Fox Kids was defunct and Kids WB was a shell of its former self and on its way out. 

I'm pretty sure this answered your question."
Bob the Builder,"Okay say what you will about recent cartoons but let’s not pretend that creativity has been the issue for this decade. Gravity Falls, Over the Garden Wall, The Amazing World of Gumball, Regular Show, The Legend of Korra, Hilda, Star vs the Forces of Evil, The Dragon Prince, Steven Universe, OK KO, Wander Over Yonder, Milo Murphy’s Law, Uncle Grandpa, and ***Adventure Time*** for Christ’s sake. The list could go on. Say what you will, but creativity is *not* an issue for those shows. "
Bob the Builder,And a mix of 1984 & 85
Bob the Builder,"Ahh yes, the 2000s, known for such unwatchable trash as SpongeBob SquarePants and Avatar the last Airbender."
Bob the Builder,"While this is true, we're also getting many great kid cartoons too. The Amazing World of Gumball, Gravity Falls, The Legend of Korra, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, and probably more are recent examples of great kid shows. The 90's-early 2000's had their share of stickers too, including awful reboots."
Bob the Builder,"Well that disproves their whole argument.

Move along, people."
Bob the Builder,It gave us one of the best video games ever produced - Superman on Nintendo 64.
Bob the Builder,"i'm guessing: ""and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research"""
Bob the Builder,Well it worked because those toys were freaking awesome!
Bob the Builder,Your being brain washed
Bob the Builder,How'd you find this thread from 3 years ago?
Bob the Builder,Oh yeah. Raccoons on a Sat morning before Superman then Live amd Kicking.
Bob the Builder,It's not creavity the artstyle is the same and gets boring after 2000s anyone could realise this happening
Bob the Builder,Is that when M.A.S.K came out?
Bob the Builder,Space Adventure Cobra. Best cartoon ever.
Bob the Builder,Get out. 
Bob the Builder,Exactly. Not an end all be all list. Loved Inspector Gadget.   
Bob the Builder,"I was getting nostalgic and wanted to compile a list of 2000s shows that I used to watch and download it later, searched something like ""popular 90s/2000s tv shows"" and here I am"
Bob the Builder,...and Transformers and GI Joe
Bob the Builder,"ah that makes sense, IDK where I got them all from I pirated them like 10 years ago. probably all on D+ now"
Bob the Builder,"AMC comeback?  His last show ended 7 months ago.  Jesus christ, some of these writers I swear.  You'd think the guy hasn't been on TV the past decade."
Bob the Builder,Has this dude been in anything bad
Bob the Builder,It isn’t a roll of the dice for me. I’d watch Odenkirk kiss an elephants ass.
Bob the Builder,"An, another comeback story for someone who’s had nothing but success for the last 10-15 years."
Bob the Builder,I have watch the premiere now and absolutely love it. So glad Bob Odenkirk is playing something different from BCS and doing it so well.
Bob the Builder,“AMC comeback” it’s been only seven months since Better Call Saul ended lol.
Bob the Builder,Lmao “comeback” for a guy thats been in two of the most critically-acclaimed shows of the past two decades and whose latest show just ended less than a year ago. I love Bob Odenkirk but this title is ridiculous
Bob the Builder,The first episode of this show is already available on AMC+.  I have a free subscription that I never used so I plan on watching tonight.
Bob the Builder,Just give the man a sketch show again.
Bob the Builder,"The book this is based on, Richard Russo's Straight Man, is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Looking forward to this."
Bob the Builder,Let’s hope this isn’t another “Your Honor” situation.
BoJack Horseman,"Weird post. I love this scene, but I can't imagine it carries much weight unless you've actually seen the show and know the characters.  

So who's this for? Just all us fans, to go ""oh yeah, nice, good scene"" over? Hmm."
BoJack Horseman,This finale has a special place in my heart. One of the best I must say.
BoJack Horseman,Any context?
BoJack Horseman,"Oh yeah, nice, good scene"
BoJack Horseman,"Yeah, it’s hard to understand the depth of Diane and Bojack’s conversation here without having the context of all the shit they’ve been through over the entire series. Definitely an amazing finale of an amazing TV show though. I like how the finale checks in on how each of the main characters is doing, but doesn’t really have a definite end to any of their stories. It’s very much like shit happens and then life goes on."
BoJack Horseman,It carries a ton of weight if you actually listen to it. What Diane's talking about doesn't just apply specifically to her.
BoJack Horseman,"Ummm I think you can actually get the gist from this clip. Maybe it carries over more if you've seen the whole show but still.


And even if it were meant just for the fans? So what? Many posts here are meant or attract fans of only specific shows. So I don't get your problem."
BoJack Horseman,[Back in the 90s he was in a very famous tv show.](https://youtu.be/FBw-Z8ULwcc)
BoJack Horseman,"Bojack is a a troubled character who generally makes things harder for everyone. Diane and him became close friends, but she reaches a point where she can't continue to be his support figure at the expense of her own wellbeing. After months of her leaving LA and ignoring his calls, they are at the same event and we get this scene."
BoJack Horseman,"They've been friends for years, he was her childhood hero/star of her favourite show growing up, she dated his friend/frenemy which is how she ended up meeting him, later got hired to ghostwrite his autobiography for him, they became best friends and also worked together on and off for years, she married and divorced his friend in that time, her own career took off. They're both talented but troubled in different ways and ultimately Diane has bailed BoJack out time and time again, always making excuses for him and encouraging him to seek redemption even when he does the most vile shit. Because he also understands her better than anyone and has accepted her at her lowest too. They've both essentially said that the other person is the only thing that makes sense to them in the world.

So this is their friendship essentially ending after like seven years of being wrapped up in each other's toxic drama and trauma and relapses. It's showing the end of a life-defining relationship and friendship that while ultimately for the better is still bittersweet, the idea that this was just a phase and now it's over, how people move in and out of your life, etc.

This is the final scene of the show but it's honestly a masterpiece well worth watching."
BoJack Horseman,They're on a roof... I guess.
BoJack Horseman,"I can’t stop watching Bojack.  I finished watching it again last week, flipped around for a few minutes and put it right back on, not because I wanted to take it in again, but for some reason I feel seen when I watch this show.  I’m already back on season 3."
BoJack Horseman,This episode is so good. This show had an amazing run. I will definitely miss it. I need to check out Tuca & Bertie.
BoJack Horseman,The best bojack horseman episode.
BoJack Horseman,bojack horseman is a show that conveys feelings you didn’t even know you had
BoJack Horseman,This scene gives me so much anxiety.
BoJack Horseman,"He’s been here multiple times before, this is the first time he’s gone to the show, it’s completely cheapened when you go “haha just kidding he’s not dead”.  The final episode should have been us seeing the fallout of his death and how it affected those close to him, but they wanted him around for continuation potential. It’s an absolutely phenomenal episode that is followed by a wet fart."
BoJack Horseman,"> I feel seen

I See You"
BoJack Horseman,"Tuca is (usually) not as heartbreaking but it goes as deep as BoJack, although in an arguably healthier way.

Also, keep in mind Tuca is an artist driven show, while BoJack is a writer driven show.

That being said, Tuca is a show I deeply love as a BoJack fan. It has a special place in my heart. I highly recommend it, but don’t go expecting a BoJack 2. It’s its own thing, and it’s very beautiful."
BoJack Horseman,T&B is definitely worth watching. Definitely wackier than BoJack; it has solid dramatic moments but it is mainly an absurdist slapstick comedy.
BoJack Horseman,"While I think him dying would've been a solid way to end it, I do think the finale we got was truer to the show's message of ""constantly trying to improve despite often going 1 step forward, 3 steps back.""  He's destroyed almost all the relationships in his life but has to keep carrying on and trying."
BoJack Horseman,"Fakeout deaths can definitely feel cheap, but I think ""redemptive character arc ends with death"" is also a pretty cheap and overused trope. It's a better end for him to live with the weight of what he has done to the people around him."
BoJack Horseman,They definitely didn’t keep him for continuation potential.
BoJack Horseman,"What a terrible message to send to people who are going through the same struggles as BoJack.

If you kill him, you are telling those people “death is the only way you will get redeemed”. Which is the worst thing to say to someone in that situation.

Also, killing the main character as an ending is cheap as heck."
BoJack Horseman,"Leaving room for him to redeem himself is a much, much more satisfying ending than “oh look that main character you followed for all those seasons is dead now, bye!”

Satisfying endings should never be sacrificed for edgy or surprising endings."
BoJack Horseman,"The final two episodes are alternate endings ""Sometimes lifes a bitch and then you die, but sometimes lifes a bitch and then you keep living."""
BoJack Horseman,"They didn't want him around for continuation potential - the show literally ended for good 20 minutes later. They kept him around because the  message they wanted to send was summed up in the last conversation ""Sometimes life's a bitch and you keep going"" killing him basically undermines that message completely just to wallow in darkness. The show was never about the darkness, but trying, often unsuccessfully or unhealthily, to heal and improve and move forward through it. It's a much more common and adult message about depression than the current disney push of death = redemption. It doesn't, it's cheap way to bypass years of atonement that truly would actually help you and the people you've hurt."
BoJack Horseman,"agreed. I can understand why they didn't want to end it with this episode, but yeah

they should've"
BoJack Horseman,"There are many characters in the show that represent that message, I dont see bojack as one of them. He was on a self destructive path the entire show, culminating in the penultimate episode. Still love the show, and especially this episode."
BoJack Horseman,I missed the redemptive part of his journey.
BoJack Horseman,"The story is done and RBW has already moved on to another projects. And he has expressed several times he has no interest in bringing the series back. He told the story he wanted to tell, even if he would have preferred to get an extra season in order to tell it with a better pace."
BoJack Horseman,"Yeah, we’ll see."
BoJack Horseman,People in the same struggles as bojack? How many abusive pedophiles do we have to worry about?
BoJack Horseman,"The entire episode is about accepting his death, and it’s “surprising“?

The ending isn’t satisfying, it’s clear he’s just going to continue fucking up, whilst everyone around him moves on."
BoJack Horseman,"I admit I haven't seen much Disney recently, but this sounds fascinating. Can you give some examples of Disney pushing death as a redemption? And I surmise we aren't just talking of the classic noble self-sacrifice that has plagued fiction forever, even in non-western media like anime."
BoJack Horseman,"There is no real redemption for the things we do, kind of the final lesson of the show."
BoJack Horseman,"Good job twisting my words. A lot of people relate to these characters even if they are not going through *exactly the same things*. People also relate to other characters who are shitty persons, such as Gregory House, or Rick Sanchez. But I would bet good money none of them is a medical genius or the most intelligent being in the universe.

People relate to these characters and their struggles. BoJack took the responsible approach of not turning him into a God (like Rick and Morty did), but also of not telling the audience he deserved death as a punishment for his actions."
BoJack Horseman,Star Wars does it constantly
BoJack Horseman,"Okay I haven't seen this show so not trying to pick either side on this debate, but did you dislike the ending of Boardwalk? I think fiction should be free to dole whatever ending characters get, even if they are relatable and even if it ""sends a terrible message"". Well, not that you judging it is a a bad thing, we can all have our opinions on what fiction is allowed to do or what is cheap.

Based on what I see here, Bojack does not believe in an afterlife. I know fictional suicide is sometimes accused of glorifying it or endorsing it, but as long as a suicidal character isn't shown even getting to any kind of afterlife, I always fail to agree with putting such responsibility on fiction."
BoJack Horseman,"Great to hear it! Season 4 was terrific, sometimes heartbreaking television. ""Time's Arrow"" (the dementia episode) was one of the most emotional and well-done episodes of television I've seen this year."
BoJack Horseman,"The newest season is brilliant. I watched the ""you're a piece of shit"" episode this morning before work. "
BoJack Horseman,"""Frack me Mr. Peanutbutter!""
So uncomfortable "
BoJack Horseman,"Is that the horse from ""Horsin' Around""?"
BoJack Horseman,The thing that makes this show so brilliant is its ability to balance ridiculousness with the darker themes so well. It's saturated with animal puns and random wacky shit but it's also one of the most accurate depictions of depression on TV right now.
BoJack Horseman,"I do wonder if this will be the final season and if it ends in the way the show has hinted towards...

Regardless, I trust the show to keep up it's ridiculous high standard of storytelling. Can't wait!"
BoJack Horseman,"It is simultaneously true that I want more, but considered season 4 to be a great ending if that was 'it'. 

I'm actually shocked that 4 seasons in the show is this good, as is the general consensus. Let's see how long they can keep it up. "
BoJack Horseman,"This is so awesome. Why, I have half a mind....."
BoJack Horseman,"I just binge-watched the whole show over 3 days. The episode ""Fish out of water"" was easily one of the best episodes of tv I've seen all year."
BoJack Horseman,"Easily my favorite Netflix original. I wonder what the story holds once they finish 
"
BoJack Horseman,Well duh. Suck a dick dumb shits
BoJack Horseman,Hoooray! Question mark?
BoJack Horseman,"Of course it was going to be renewed.  Who wants to watch shows about people who love each other when we have BoJack?

Suck a dick, dumbshits. *blows raspberry*"
BoJack Horseman,Hooray! Was there ever any doubt? 
BoJack Horseman,"Well deserved, Bojack is one of the best shows out now.

This was a really quick announcement too, which makes me a bit more nervous about MST3K getting a season 12."
BoJack Horseman,What time is it right now?
BoJack Horseman,DOGGY DOGGY what now?
BoJack Horseman,This show is too real for me sometimes :(
BoJack Horseman,Gonna be hard to top season 4
BoJack Horseman,Why did it take this long lmao. I'm shocked the show hasn't been confirmed until its finale.
BoJack Horseman,"I'm one of those thick-headed cynics that feel like a lot of the hype around Netflix is entirely based on the binge-format of their shows, and there are many better outlets for comedy than Netflix itself, but I have to say, BoJack Horseman might actually be one the best comedy series of all time. 

Constant laughs, intelligent jokes, subtle artistry, and very-real tear jerking episodes that make you sit on the edge of your seat every time it takes a stab at you. 

I kind of hope it goes for 20+ seasons, like Simpsons, South Park, and Family Guy did before it. I don't think i've ever seen such an elaborate show before, and I'm actually content with the fact that Aaron Paul and Will Arnett may never need to be in a ""live-action"" show again. "
BoJack Horseman,Still have not seen this show. I guess its time to binge watch.
BoJack Horseman,"God damn. A fucking cartoon horse is a more accurate description of how I feel about myself than any other role I've seen.

I'd drink about this, but my husband is having his third surgery tomorrow for the same damn injury he sustained after falling in an elevator shift in July and I need to not be hung over.

He's probably going to lose his job and I am unemployed, not anywhere near able to earn even half of what he earned- even if I could find a job.

But the fact that I am going to binge watch season 4 again tonight because this BoJack post reminds me of just how much I fucking love this God damn show brings me enough joy to actually get out of bed and take a shower.

Thank you."
BoJack Horseman,Your post made me think like [this](https://media.giphy.com/media/3osxYlhbYjOIDEZhkI/giphy.gif)
BoJack Horseman,Bojack>Rick and Morty... fight me
BoJack Horseman,This show just continues to get better. I have never been so happy to be depressed! 
BoJack Horseman,"Even though I disagree with [this review](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/09/i-do-not-like-the-sad-horse-show.html) of the latest season, it's a super entertaining read."
BoJack Horseman,"Back in the 90's, I was in a very famous teeeeveeee show!"
BoJack Horseman,"Can I ask: I saw the first three seasons, but I'm really on the fence about seeing season 4.  I loved the series, but part of me feels like I've had my fill.  It just seems like there comes a point where the fact that Bojack can never find happiness and never seem to figure things out makes the entire journey feel futile and maybe that's the point, but I'm just not sure if that's worth watching another season of.  So I guess I'm wondering: Is the fourth season worth it from that perspective?

Edit: Thank you all for your help.  It sounds like season 4 is definitely worth watching."
BoJack Horseman,Second to last episode of season 4 is some of the best tv I have seen. Ever.
BoJack Horseman,Bojack is depressed just like me so I feel not so depressed about being depressed!
BoJack Horseman,Doggie doggie what now
BoJack Horseman,Bo for Gojack
BoJack Horseman,"Hi! As someone who hasn't seen the show and has no idea what's it about, how would you describe it? Do you guys recommend it?

Thanks "
BoJack Horseman,As it should be.  It's brilliant for what it is.  Holy hell was this last season dark.  Very dark. Amazingly realized but good god it really accentuated dementia (or Alzheimer's but since they are so similar trait-wise it can be interchangeable) and it's affects on not just the person involved (extremely well done by the way) but everyone else.  Dementia is terrible slow and horrifying over a very long period of time.  I watched my grandfather suffer for at least a year with it. Every day he asked about his wife (who had died years back) and some days he was horrified at learning she died. Other days he was angry. Just angry.  I can't even explain how frustrating it was for us but also how maddening it must be for the person suffering.  
BoJack Horseman,Best news of the day!!! Is this not the best show ever? 
BoJack Horseman,"People talk about how sad it is but the show deserves more credit for being so fucking beautiful. So many moments where the animation, music and voice-acting line up so perfectly it gives me chills. The final scenes of the last two seasons come to mind. "
BoJack Horseman,Back in the 90s 
BoJack Horseman,I just finished season 4 and the end of it left me with such a good feeling.
BoJack Horseman,"Bojack is so unique in that it perfectly captures the human condition: struggles with mental health, depression, drug abuse, all whilst using non-human characters. The show is hilarious yet tugs right at your heart. The only show I can compare it to is futurama, although futurama takes a *much* more light hearted tone. "
BoJack Horseman,This show is so underrated. I never see anyone talk about it. Too busy circlejerking over Rick and Morty.
BoJack Horseman,I saw Three episodes including The pilot and i didnt find it entartaining at all. When does it get good?
BoJack Horseman,no brainer
BoJack Horseman,"I love the show, but I can't watch it any more, it's just too much."
BoJack Horseman,"I remember I started watching this show thinking, 'everyone will hate the first season then it'll blow up'. Glad I've enjoyed every season thus far and probably those yet to come."
BoJack Horseman,I'm so glad Lenny Turteltaub agreed to renew this show.
BoJack Horseman,"""He said we have a mob mentality! LET'S KILL HIM!""
"
BoJack Horseman,That moment when a cartoon gets you in your feelings. I now realize I'm a piece of shit. 
BoJack Horseman,This show is incredible. I want 10 seasons.
BoJack Horseman,[deleted]
BoJack Horseman,"This show is one of Netflix's best. Really looking forward to season 5, and the accompanied depression I'll sure gain from watching."
BoJack Horseman,"Absolutely my most favorite tv show ever. I'm in love with bojack horseman and wish more than anything it would just go on and on forever, but sadly, I see its end coming soon :( "
BoJack Horseman,Hooray! Question mark? 
BoJack Horseman,"Diane, I am a famous, everyone gives me everything I want all the time. It is an existential curse, but a huge day-to-day convenience."
BoJack Horseman,Has Netflix announced whether or not they got the rights to JDSP: HSCWDTKDTKTLFO yet? I'd like to see a Netflix reboot of that.
BoJack Horseman,I like that smooth jazz in the beginning 
BoJack Horseman,Is it funny? Debating starting it
BoJack Horseman,One of and some of the best writing and written shows on air waves 
BoJack Horseman,This season was a work of art.
BoJack Horseman,[deleted]
BoJack Horseman,"The Dementia episode was frightfully well done, i was just sitting motionless mouth agape for 5 minutes at the end of that. Actually called to warn friends. It was just, too well done.
"
Orphan Black,">It follows a group of women — one of them played by Ritter

Seems like they're not going to have Krysten Ritter play multiple roles; definitely the way to go - let the incredible performances of Tatiana Maslany stand on their own."
Orphan Black,Still wondering how and why they are making this an Orphan Black show because OB is Tatiana Maslany and clone club.  I like Ritter and thought she was perfect as Jessica Jones but if you dont have the clones why even set it in the Orphan Black universe?   Unless Ritter is a new clone but that would require some serious retcons.
Orphan Black,"So, Tatiana Maslany is playing the Marvel hero while Krysten Ritter is in Orphan Black? It's funny. Imagine going back in time to 2016 and sharing THAT information about the future."
Orphan Black,"Tatiana Maslany was fantastic. Every clone felt so different. 

No slight on her acting ability but probably the safe route to go having her not trying to repeat what Tatiana did. Still want her back as Jessica Jones though."
Orphan Black,She's cool but those are some massive shoes to fill.
Orphan Black,"Ritter is a strong enough and different enough actress to take Orphan Black in to a different direction, which is probably the smartest course of action. We don't want a clone (could not resist) of the original.

But this reminds me how one of the most satisfying Emmy wins ever was that for Maslany on Orphan Black. There was just this amazing groundswell of support, as year after year she did not even get nominated (OB was not on a major network of HBO, so was under-seen), but the sheer virtuosity of her performance broke through to Emmy voters finally."
Orphan Black,Shitagi Nashi!!!!
Orphan Black,"Orphan black: Generations.

It was a good show for a few seasons that went off some major rails by the end. I'm not excited for more, especially without Tatiana. She was basically my only reason for even watching the last season."
Orphan Black,"Some people over at some Marvel subreddits are gushing over Moon Knight and how Oscar Isaac plays multiple personalities. 
I have to disagree. Every character just seemed like Isaac with a different accent or a slightly wider eyes. 
Tatiana Maslany's character had a totally different way of moving and being in the space."
Orphan Black,"Absolutely loved Orphan Black.  Love Krysten Ritter.

Not sure about this though."
Orphan Black,"She's no Tatiana that's for sure. This sounds like a cheap cash-in, like those ""Searching for Jack Reacher"" books that just pay to license the name Jack Reacher but guess what.. they never find Jack Reacher."
Orphan Black,"Orphan Black was one of my favorite shows - and Ritter is one of my favorite actors.  Yeah, I will be watching it."
Orphan Black,Krysten Ritter is so underrated.  I will check out anything she appears in.  I really hope to see her in She Hulk or Daredevil as Jessica Jones.
Orphan Black,"TBH, I dropped Orphan Black in its third season when it got too convoluted for its own good. So, I would rather have Krysten in another series. (Still hoping for that Apartment 23 reunion.)"
Orphan Black,she's pretty hot
Orphan Black,I guess Disney+ can't make a PG-13 version of Jessica Jones like they're doing with Daredevil.
Orphan Black,She is too old
Orphan Black,Loved her on Eric Andre
Orphan Black,"I'm not a big fan of Krysten Ritter. I am a huge fan of Orphan Black. I don't know if anyone can fill Tatiana's shoes. I'm kind of bummed they didn't include tatiana and did a series of the podcast spin off. I loved all of the characters. Felix, Helena was my fav, Donny, and Ms S... I am annoyed. I want more of them. 
I honestly am kind of pissed of the new casting"
Orphan Black,"Remember Helena's bar scene? Or when she got a ""refund"" for Allison and Donny? Lol she was so funny. I loved how the characters came together towards the end. Brought Helena into the group. And she still said funny shit. Total badass"
Orphan Black,Hell yeah!!!
Orphan Black,I thought she died in breaking bad
Orphan Black,and for some reason orphan black has been taken off all streaming services just when i was about to rewatch it
Orphan Black,"Yeah that was next fucking level.  

Watching the finale, I quickly thought how lovely the wrap party must've been - such strong chemistry among the cast members.   
Then remembered *oof*, right, facepalm...  Like it surely WAS lovely, just ~6 people smaller than I'd first pictured.   
And yes I'm a dumdum, but also she was **that good**."
Orphan Black,So you're telling me I won't get to watch eight or so Krysten Ritters? That's a bummer.
Orphan Black,">let the incredible performances of Tatiana Maslany stand on their own.

Yep. Can't replicate that magic. I still have her OB performance as one of the best TV acting performances of the decade. Shame she only won one Emmy for it."
Orphan Black,"I'm curious what the plot will be. The main draw/selling point of OB was Maslany's performance. It *made* OB a talking point.

Without something bombastic, I don't see how the sequel series is going to last."
Orphan Black,"Yeah, honestly Orphan Black was pretty often a complete mess rescued solely by Tatiana Maslany carrying the entire thing on her back, in a cave, with a box of scraps. It's not really clear to me what's compelling enough about the universe to justify a spin-off.

None of which is meant to denigrate Krysten Ritter, who's been good in other stuff I've seen her in."
Orphan Black,Yea the final season was a little messy but they did wrap up the story.
Orphan Black,"> that would require some serious retcons.

Writers: hold my Jim Beam."
Orphan Black,"funnily enough, the current comic book run of Jessica jones is about her having to deal with her variants(so almost like clones)"
Orphan Black,Some people have speculated it will focus on an adult Kira
Orphan Black,We dont know enough to suss out the story. I think maybe set in past or future where clones that could have children find out about mother past or present medical complications
Orphan Black,According to rumours she’ll be back as Jessica soon.
Orphan Black,I’m watching alias and Jennifer garnet plays a bunch of characters to. Highly recommend if you like Tatiana’s chops
Orphan Black,I think they recognized that Maslany and her performance are inimitable so they're not going to have her playing multiple roles like Maslany did
Orphan Black,"Shut up, goblin! I don't know you."
Orphan Black,Tatiana deserved more Emmys for carrying the show on her back lol
Orphan Black,"> It was a good show for a few seasons that went off some major rails by the end.

That's good to know as I was on the fence about starting it."
Orphan Black,Recent Jack Reacher show was good.
Orphan Black,"With rated R movies on D+, with MA shows on D+, and with upcoming R and MA projects coming to D+, why couldn’t Daredevil be MA as well?"
Orphan Black,I did the same thing. I saw a cast picture once (from Comic Con I think?) and it was only Tatiana with 2 or 3 other people and it took me a minute to realize... 😂
Orphan Black,"yeah in that final scene I was like ""these actors are so good... wait shit she's all of them"""
Orphan Black,That dance sequence between the clones is what I'm picture.
Orphan Black,"I remember when a new clone was introduced, I went to IMDB to find out who the actress was. I searched for like 2 minutes before I realised of course it’s Tatiana. Because there are like 5 other character names I couldn’t find it."
Orphan Black,She good and beautiful but she don't have the acting skills to play 8 different versions
Orphan Black,Agree.  It started off great but was a complete mess story wise the last two seasons but still eminently watchable because of how amazing Maslany was in making each clone so distinct.   I still laugh at myself over the episode where Cosima has to pretend to be Alison and I caught myself thinking how great the actress who plays Cosima was in imitating the actress who plays Alison.
Orphan Black,"It was great in S1 but as usual with a lot of these shows where the creators don't think much past S1 when creating their story and have to come up with something very fast as they only get a limited amount of time to write a S2 after S1, S2 and onwards were just all over the place. The worst part of it all was that (imo) they actually managed to come up with some decent ideas and plot beats for S2, it's just the actual writing and how it all unfolded was poorly executed."
Orphan Black,"""I'm sorry,  I'm not Tatiana Maslany""."
Orphan Black,"damn, I barely remember how that show ends...actually I don't even remember how it ends."
Orphan Black,Please the writers have enough class to drink Buffalo Trace at least.
Orphan Black,"I cant see that working without Tatiana because even if they said Sarah was dead what about aunts Alison, Cosima, Helena, etc.  They would be involved in Kiras life, especially if Sarah died."
Orphan Black,I really hope so.
Orphan Black,"If you mean Jennifer Garner, she plays one character with a wig collection that rivals Moira Rose's."
Orphan Black,I'll give it a look. Only on Disney+ from what I can tell?
Orphan Black,"It's defnitely worth watching. While sstory itself might not be the best, the characters are amazing and their interactions and acting is top notch."
Orphan Black,"honestly it is worth watching it - the story is a bit bonkers, but the acting is pretty good"
Orphan Black,"""This actress isn't doing a great job at pretending to be the Ukrainian one... Wait a minute"""
Orphan Black,One could argue that any actress/actor who played at least 8 different characters in various movies/films has  the skills to play... 8 different characters.
Orphan Black,Krysten Ritter is a great actress.
Orphan Black,"Whenever random clones would come back, I’d always be so happy that they got the actress to come back, before reminding myself it was still just Tatianna. She just did such a great job at making the characters seem so seperate."
Orphan Black,"Heh I just posted on some unrelated thread how when I hit that scene and paused the show and googled “Did Tatiana Maslany win best actress” and then resumed watching, glad to see I wasn’t the only one who saw it."
Orphan Black,YUP
Orphan Black,"They went to the island, cleaned up, came home and had a happy bbq."
Orphan Black,Writer here. We only drink top-shelf grain alcohol.
Orphan Black,Hahaha fair fair but there’s more to the disguises than just Hair
Orphan Black,Yes and Hulu I think
Orphan Black,Ukrainian FWIW.
Orphan Black,nah I think it is probably very different playing against yourself
Orphan Black,that's why I said she can't do it ;)
Orphan Black,"Yes, there's also the sometimes dubious accents and the frequently revealing outfits."
Orphan Black,"Thank you, edited."
Orphan Black,"Why? It's not as though she's really playing against herself. All good actors know how to act against a green screen or a body double.

Maybe it would be difficult for method actors who like to immerse in their characters for the entire duration of the shooting, because how would they immerse in 10 different characters at once? But other than that, I don't see a difference."
Orphan Black,So did Tatiana Maslany and Krysten Ritter get traded in some kind of draft or something?
Orphan Black,Orphan Black was so good at the beginning. But it went way off the rails.
Orphan Black,Hmmm I can already tell I’m going to watch this
Orphan Black,"I like Ritter but she's like a pouty chihuahua compared to Maslany, two entirely different leagues"
Orphan Black,"It did kind of go off the rails but it was enjoyable until the end for me, I really loved that show."
Orphan Black,Reminds me that I never finished it. Made it so close to but I just couldn’t keep track of what was going on anymore
Orphan Black,I loved season 1 and was less enthusiastic about S2 and then never bothered after that.
Orphan Black,I check out when they start bringing in the brothers on my rewatches
Orphan Black,"Stopped watching when they introduced >!the male clones!< , does it have a good ending?"
Orphan Black,"I felt kind of bad for Ari Millen, he was criticised for not being as good as Maslany but she was given clearly distinct characters to act out. Millen on the other hand was given ""soldier with a scar"", ""soldier undercover"", ""soldier that's slightly more timid than the others but is still a soldier"", I know it makes sense from a story perspective that they're all very similar characters but he didn't get much to work with, at least they gave him a different character to play in the final season."
Orphan Black,No. But I enjoyed Maslany's acting until the end. It carries the show.
Orphan Black,"Honestly the ending was pretty satisfying and fun to watch, there are some questions you don't get a good answer for but they did a good job of tying up loose ends. I'm pretty difficult to please for final episodes but I thought it was good."
Orphan Black,This is exactly where I stopped but I was enjoying it.  I just kind of didn’t finish…
Orphan Black,"When it originally aired, I also cut out after season 2, because I didn't think the Castor plot was going to engage me. I rewatched and continued through the full series in the last month, and I was right--season 3 is probably the weakest of the bunch. The back half of season 4 and all of season 5 successfully course-corrected though, and I think it sticks the landing."
Orphan Black,"> Stopped watching when they introduced

I hated when that happened as well nevertheless I continued to watch because of TM. I honestly could not believe that several seasons in I still could forget sometimes for a few seconds that I was watching the same actress. #HelenaBestCloneEver."
Orphan Black,"> he was criticised for not being as good as Maslany

an extremely high bar.

I wouldn't be watching She Hulk if she wasnt so god damned charming."
Orphan Black,I thought it had a decent enough ending especially after season 3 I thought there was no hope left
Orphan Black,Fr She Hulk is such an okay show but Maslany’s back must be hurting for carrying the show with her charismatic and solid ass acting.
Orphan Black,yup ... because most of the other people kinda suck.. Titania isn't funny as a villain.
Orphan Black,Titania’s character is not even good at all even tho I like the actress. Definitely one of the weakest Marvel shows.
Orphan Black,"it's held up by Tatiana's awesomeness and there are occasional jokes I found hysterical, but i didn't have much to laugh to last two episodes and hopefully this week's isn't another dud."
Orphan Black,"I just need to point out how a show called Echoes came out last year, then we are getting this show, and an AppleTV+ plus series called Echo 3 and the Marvel show, Echo. That’s a lot of Echo shows."
Orphan Black,"She's been a continuing presence on British TV since something called *Tipping The Velvet* in 2002. Never fails to put in a good performance - *Ashes to Ashes* is a good example of her work. She also voiced Lara Croft in the second trilogy of games.

Her husband is Matthew Macfayden from *Succession* - they met on the set of *Spooks* (American title *MI-5*) back in 2002."
Orphan Black,"she continues to be in everything and it's great, even though I don't end up watching all her shows."
Orphan Black,"Orphan black was great until it wasn’t. In the times it wasn’t, it was completely carried by Tatiana Maslany’s acting. 

Considering it’s a mini series and the cast seems good, I will check it out."
Orphan Black,"*Orphan Black* was amazing, yet a disturbingly macabre portrait of the biotechnology industry.
Some of the original showrunners are on the set,
I'd give this a watch."
Orphan Black,"I just need to point out how a show called Echoes came out last year, then we are getting this show, and an AppleTV+ plus series called Echo 3 and the Marvel show, Echo. That’s a lot of Echo shows."
Beyblade,TIL Beyblade vs Yu-Gi-Oh! discussions have raged since ancient times.
Beyblade,"""Children's toy is actually a relic of the ancient world that changed the course of history"" is undoubtedly the best anime trope."
Beyblade,"Bin Laden was actually killed by an elite team of ""bladers,"" Seal Team Six was a simple cover up to hide the true power of the Beyblades from the public "
Beyblade,slaves... LETS BEYYYYBLADE!!!
Beyblade,Jesus died for our spins.
Beyblade,Yu-Gi-Oh GX has an episode where they say the universe is made out of Duel Monsters cards
Beyblade,"Personally, I preferred the first Beyblade generation--Tyson, Kai, Ray, Max and Kenny."
Beyblade,"And Moses said unto the Pharaoh, ""Pharaoh! Let my beyblade rip!"""
Beyblade,"According to historians, the word ""Bible"" is a mistranslation from the Hebrew word בייבלייד, [baeh-bl-eid], which actually means Beyblade."
Beyblade,The things one does to save his people from ancient Egyptian card games... [on motorcycles.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKDMTwpLFTI)
Beyblade,"Why do shows always end up like this? First season: literally just kids playing with toys. Later seasons: toys are actually weapons of mass destruction that were used in the past to change or oppress the world.

Yu-Gi-Oh was exactly the same."
Beyblade,We can make a religion out of this
Beyblade,[deleted]
Beyblade,So the conflict between the Israelites and the Egyptians was actually about beyblade and duel monsters
Beyblade,[deleted]
Beyblade,And thus the first dreidle was born. 
Beyblade,"Omfg, they actually took a real painting of Moses and put a beyblade on top of it lmao"
Beyblade,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel, I made you out of Bey...   "
Beyblade,"""The power to change rivers and oceans"" then shows the red sea, which is neither a river nor an ocean. "
Beyblade,Im sorry but... wut
Beyblade,I had a beyblade party when i was 8 i invited everyone in my class and im pretty sure only 3 of us actually normally played with them 
Beyblade,Since ancient times the existence of baes can be found throughout moments in history!

Beyblade,Remins me how in Prince of Tennis it turns out the dinosaurs were wiped out because one guy hit a tennis ball really [hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNoX5ozDtU).
Beyblade,"And god said to Moses...
LET IT RIP !"
Beyblade,So Egyptian played Children card game while Jews played with Children toys? No wonder they hated each other so much
Beyblade,Bae blades
Beyblade,"And then God said, ""LET IT RIP!"""
Beyblade,Dammit Barry. He stuck his dick into this timeline too
Beyblade,"i love the first comment on the video LMAO

""First weapon to surpass Metal Gear""

HAHAHAHAH"
Beyblade,I went back and watched the first season of BeyBlades and the last quarter of the show was almost all anti Russia propaganda.
Beyblade,A lot of people don't know this but jesus lost a beyblade championship and was banished from Earth forever.  That's where we get B.C. (Beyblade Championship.)
Beyblade,Jesus Christ that's ridiculous
Beyblade,"It *really* looks like that scene where it was explicitly Moses was added in the dub. That just baffles me because I would think that's the kind of thing they would actually cut out, not add in!"
Beyblade,Can we get rid of fidget spinners and just have bayblades make a comeback?
Beyblade,As much / more believable as the original story Id say
Beyblade,"I'm now imagining the the pyrmamids as giant beyblades of the Ancient Eqyptian Gods.

The Sphinx is a statue of an ancient Bit Beast.

"
Beyblade,"I'm in my mid-30s so I never saw beyblades until just now.  As funny as the Moses thing is, I find the delivery by the guy in the suit to be the funniest because I keep hearing ""bey"" as ""bae."""
Beyblade,Explain THIS Atheists...
Beyblade,"I'm a Red Sea pedestrian!!! 

Best line ever! "
Beyblade,Thanks for making Youtube suggest everything Beyblade for me now.
Beyblade,Let thy people go or Let it Rip! 
Beyblade,moses first unlocked the true power of the beyblade by believing in his friends
Beyblade,When was this not the case? I'm pretty sure this was the general consensus. 
Beyblade,"Don't underestimate Beyblades they are actually really powerful. For example, I once used one to pleasure my girlfriend. You wouldn't believe the way she screamed ""stop that"""
Beyblade,If only the pharaoh had used his ancient egyptian laser beams from his millennium items.
Beyblade,I mean its not any more ridiculous than the actual story  
Beyblade,"In the name of The Galactic Bladers of the Republic, you're under arrest Chancelor 

""Are you threatening me master blader?""

The Senate will decide your fate 

""I am the Senate""

Not. Yet.

*pulls up sleve to reveal hidden bey blade* 

""It's treason then."""
Beyblade,Goddamn is am interesting choice in the title OP.
Beyblade,That's amazing. Whoever signed off on it to go through to production is a genius.
Beyblade,"""LET IT RIP!!!!"" -Moses"
Beyblade,This show was the best thing to ever exist.
Beyblade,A weapon to surpass metal gear
Beyblade,"I gotta give it to them, it makes more sense than Yu-Gi-Oh. I mean it's ridiculous, but at least I can imagine that something spinning really fast can do something. I mean it has SOME (very little, like 10^(-12)) logic. In Yu-Gi-Oh, these are fucking paper cards... Like 'oh shit it started raining, guess I can't take over the world now.'"
Beyblade,Beyblades were used in wars? Why isnt this a live action blockbuster?
Beyblade,Wouldn't it be a God-blessed Beyblade?
Beyblade,God blessed* Bleyblade
Beyblade,"I'm dead

Beyblade,I heard Beyblades were made of NANITES COURTESY OF RAY PALMER
Beyblade,R/history ?
Beyblade,Beyblades on front page. Today is a good day.
Beyblade,"""Since ancient times the existence of baes can be found in moments throughout history."""
Beyblade,That's so brazenly dumb that it actually stops being dumb.
Beyblade,"and God said..... ""LET IT RIP!"""
Beyblade,Japan merrily use Christian mythology for bombastic schlock entertainment in the same way Christians use Norse and Egyptian mythology.  Turnabout is fair play.
Beyblade,The original fidget spinner 
Beyblade,I was always a YuGiOh guy but I love this trend of children's games being rooted deep in Egyptian History. 
Beyblade,"And the Lord sayeth unto man ""Let it rip!"""
Beyblade,Wow this guy has two posts on the front page. 
Beyblade,Fidget spinners ain't got shit
Beyblade,"Idk why, but this made me laugh out loud.... in the middle of class"
Beyblade,"""Since the ancient times the existence of Beys""  

Seriously? Serious-fucking-ly?"
Beyblade,Global warming is from the newfound popularity of Beyblades amongst children and the concurrent ambient blade spinning activity worldwide.
Beyblade,I never expected to see a beyblade post in 2017
Beyblade,Still more believable than the original story.
Beyblade,Later in the New Testament we can see Jesus actually using beyblades to walk on water.
Beyblade,I wonder when fidget spinners are going to get their own anime
Beyblade,I know people like fun and games making jokes and stuff but let's get serious here. How else would you do it?
Beyblade,"And then the Lord said ""Let it rip"""
Beyblade,Of my god the fucking existance of BAES dates back thousands of years!!!! I'm dying.
Beyblade,Second blader at the Grassy Knoll: http://imgur.com/a/lwDjU
Beyblade,It's kinda odd to see Christian references made in a Japanese TV show.
Beyblade,"Who are these people? Where the hell is Tyson, Kai, Rey and Max? And that kid with the Glasses Kenny?"
Beyblade,This was my show!
Beyblade,">There is a tremendous power hidden within Bae's...

If only we knew where to look on our Bae to find this hidden power.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Beyblade,I like how the addition of a child's toy is a game changer for believability for some peiple. A god magically parting the seas to drown my enemies... sounds pretty reasonable to me. A magical children's toy is responsible? Stop being ridiculous /s
Beyblade,"Fuck yes, Beyblades. It was the only childhood cartoon-inspired purchase I ever felt gave me my money's worth in entertainment."
Beyblade,"I can't take Beyblade seriously as long as their tagline/catchphrase is ""Let it rip!!"" But I'm also not sure if I'm supposed to."
Beyblade,"Dammit I forgot that they called them ""beys"" and I remember tolerating it a lot more as a child. "
Beyblade,Wow they treat a children's toy with such seriousness.
Beyblade,Jesus christ! That's one hell of a beyblade!
Beyblade,"Take the Beyblade in your hand, Moses. With it, you shall do my wonders."
Beyblade,I love that Japan treats Judeo-Christian mythos as US / UK treat Greek / Roman / Egyptian mythology.
Beyblade,Kids now adays dont know shit about the real fidget spinner
Beyblade,"Actually, it would be a God blessed bayblade."
Beyblade,What was with the two fully animated scenes and then one scene just being a picture from the bible with another picture of a beyblade just wiggling across it
Beyblade,"One of the few instances where God is ""bey"""
Beyblade,Let It Rip
Beyblade,Lets make an anime where fidgit spinners are actuall ancient alien drones that changed history where Da vinci helicopter design came from fidgit spinners. 
Beyblade,I use to love this show for the pure absurdity of it all. 
Bitten,FWIW AMC has like ~~3~~ 2 vampire shows right now and a witches show.
Bitten,"They're out there, a lot of them have been replaced with superhero/comic book shows.

Vampire Academy
Lockwood and Co
Stranger Things
All of Us are Dead
Lucifer
Extraordinary


And everything Marvel. . ."
Bitten,"My girlfriend recently started the Nancy Drew that's been airing on The CW, and it's pure supernatural. I was honestly surprised when I saw it."
Bitten,"Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) has a new series right now about werewolves.  

Everything has just moved to streaming so it's not always as obvious that it exists."
Bitten,There were also a lot in the 90’s. I figure these things come and go in cycles. There will probably be another boom once Gen Alpha become teenagers.
Bitten,"There are so many vampire shows going on right now

-  Interview with the Vampire
-  Let the Right One In
-  Reginald The Vampire
-  Vampire Academy
-  What We Do in the Shadows
-  First Kill
-  Vampire in the Garden
-  Mystery Incorporated
-  Kissable Lips
-  Call of the Night
-  Vampire The Masquerade New York BY Night
   
There are werewolf shows, there are ferry shows, there are witch shows, there are undead shows.

There is so much supernatural shit on TV now"
Bitten,"Inevitably when these types of “what happened to X” threads, the answer is always, “OP isn’t paying attention to the numerous amount of shows in that genre that exist right now”."
Bitten,"It’s alive and well in some anime, some is good some not so much.

Mushishi is old, but it’s masterclass supernatural drama with some slice of life. It’s episodic as well, so you only have a tiny handful of returning characters and some backstory for the MC. Other than that, episodes are completely self-contained. IMO one of the best anime to show a non-anime person. 

It can be very happy or very sad. Invisible creatures of incomprehensible shape made of the pure life-essence in everything passively affect life either positively and negatively, but they’re neither malicious nor are they benevolent, they just exist. Mushishi are doctors who can see them and are trained to purge them, but the MC has more of a catch and release mentality. The MC travels the country constantly looking for those who are inflicted."
Bitten,"It's a niche category, and the market became saturated, and people got tired of it.  Then came zombies, which also flooded the market, but ""The Last of Us"" seems to have revived."
Bitten,Could be that other fantasy shows are stealing the audience. Especially stuff like Sandman. Or Twilight made it harder to take vampires seriously
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,Last year was actually a phenomenal year for vampire content. Interview With A Vampire on AMC and Let the      Right One In on Showtime (now removed and canceled) are among the best vampire shows ever made. IMO they’ve elevated the genre to a new height.
Bitten,"Ah, figured that maybe I just missed the ones that are currently airing."
Bitten,All of us are dead is a soft sci-fi zombie show.
Bitten,It’s way better than it had any business being.
Bitten,The last of us is not supernatural
Bitten,"http://www.mrscienceshow.com/2009/05/correlation-of-week-zombies-vampires.html?m=1

With Biden in power now we should hopefully see more vampire shows now"
Bitten,"even if the Arrowverse weren't either-dead-or-dying I'd hardly put The Flash and The Vampire Diaries in the same metaphorical conversation other than them both being ""genre"" (sci-fi or fantasy) CW shows no matter how much weird magical shit gets attributed to the Speed Force"
Bitten,What kind of fucking malware-laden spam are you trying to link to?
Bitten,Pretty elaborate headline.
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,Sounds like they came up with the name and worked backwards from there. 
Bitten,"I feel like calling something a ""procedural miniseries"" is playing a little loose with at least one of those words..."
Bitten,This sounds like shit
Bitten,Not this premise again.
Bitten,Sounds pretty stupid.
Bitten,"Wait, what?"
Bitten,"Sounds like someone was throwing darts at an idea board.

""We've got shark attack survivors.  Ex's that have to work together and finally crime fighters.  Get to writing!"""
Bitten,This sounds terrible
Bitten,Mad Libs: The Show
Bitten,This is such a dumb concept that it might punch straight through the stupid barrier and become brilliant.
Bitten,This has to be an interdimensional cable concept from Rick and Morty right?
Bitten,da fuq?
Bitten,Chained to a dog?
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,When you get high and turn a lame pun into a TV show concept...
Bitten,r/titlegore
Bitten,is that title the whole article?
Bitten,Wat
Bitten,Wat
Bitten,This sounds terrible. 
Bitten,What
Bitten,This sounds so fucking bad. Literally middle school fanfic-tier.
Bitten,"Wow, did the Always Sunny gang come up with this one?"
Bitten,Whoever made that title was on some serious drugs
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,Not Penny's Bite
Bitten,"You could have just said ""Dominic Monaghan Lands Lead in *Australian* Police Procedural Miniseries 'Bite Club'"", and we could have figured out the rest"
Bitten,What about a nose...that smells crime?
Bitten,It sounds like someone riffing about terrible CSI clones
Bitten,"I reserve this comment for only the most appropriate posts. 

*ahem*

Wat."
Bitten,"""Police procedural""

SHOCKING!"
Bitten,"In Shark Attack 3, which is a variation on Jaws made in Korea, the sharks had a baby, and in the fourth Shark Attack, the boat attacks back."
Bitten,so it's like Dexter but with a more elaborate back story
Bitten,See you in anotha life brotha.
Bitten,I'd give it a chance.
Bitten,This sounds like a fake show from Bojack
Bitten,"I know they've been running out of ideas, but wtf is this shite?"
Bitten,I don't like any of that.
Bitten,"Man, I was hoping for another season of Wild Things. Dom is a Crocodile Hunter level nature show host. "
Bitten,Congratulations?
Bitten,What an absolutely atrocious premise for anything.
Bitten,"That old premise, *again*?"
Bitten,"This is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard.


Also, was Monaghan's character attacked by both a shark AND a dog? And somehow he's hunting down murderers instead of animals?"
Bitten,"I love Dom and I even kind of like the premise, as ridiculous as it is, but is the title just a play on ""Fight Club""?"
Bitten,But why the shark attack?
Bitten,thought this was /r/subredditsimulator for a second 
Bitten,sounds like a joke plot from family guy
Bitten,"If they did, they certainly took the most complicated route."
Bitten,Ridiculously overdone
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,Like the dog could still walk around?
Bitten,"Dog handling is bestiality, isn't it?"
Bitten,/r/premisegore
Bitten,"I know, I want to watchi it"
Bitten,Where's your Charlie now?
Bitten,What if his entire head is just one big nose?
Bitten,They could learn a thing or two from 'snakes on a plane'
Bitten,"Yeah, if someone tasked me to come up with a show called ""Bite Club"", two ideas spring to mind:

* After losing his daughter to an escaped dogfighter, a pro football player forms a group of vigilantes to hunt down dogfighting rings and other animal abusers.

* When a lovesick Egyptian vampire opens the hottest club in town, everyone is just begging to get in... and to get bit!"
Bitten,"I disagree, I think they took one reasonable route, then a second one, then kind of mashed them together."
Bitten,"Szechuce.

Bitten,That kid grew up to be Turner & Hooch
Bitten,Not (on) Penny's Boat
Bitten,"Because it basically just recycled one joke for each character and ran with it for 12 years. 

Jake is dumb
Charlie sleeps with people
Alan is cheap and masturbates a lot.

Same reason I hate 2 Broke Girls. Every character in that show is a huge (slightly racist) stereotype and every line they say is a bad joke that tries to reinforce that "
Bitten,"1) why so angry?

2) No one was a Mary Sue?  Bullshit.  Charlie was 100% Mary Sue, just from the other side.  He was Lorre's wish fulfillment self insertion after his wife divorced him and fucked his whole life up.  He never learned, never grew, and never suffered any real damage from his completely awful and reckless behavior.  Even the vehicle for writing him off got walked back.

3) ridiculously misogynistic and homophobic humor.

4) the characters on this show are the worst examples of Flanderization ever.
Even worse than Big Bang.  Even worse than Ned Flanders.

5) the show was so ponderous, lame and lazy, the ""star"" of the show was replaced by a younger, stupider version and it *didn't lose any ratings.* Then the kid gets replaced by a stereotyped gay character and it *still* doesn't lose ratings, because it was dumb, lowest common denominator pee-pee, poo-poo, monkeys flinging shit humor. 

 Even the people ***on*** the show admitted that it was a shitty, lazy show."
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,I didn't watch 2 1/2 men until years into its run. but I liked the show. I liked it when Ashton Kutcher was in it.  and I even watched every episode of Anger management
Bitten,"Emilio, is that you?"
Bitten,"Is 2 + 1/2 men trendy? I had no idea it was a huge show in the states until we were a few seasons into big bang in the UK. I saw an episode and thought it was absolutely awful. I tried a couple more times, when there was nothing on, but it just seemed so bad. I just assumed it was big in the way that certain daytime TV is huge. Like a terrible soap that just has a huge viewership. I nearly laughed once at how bad a joke was, but I honestly didn't have a single laugh in any of the episodes I saw.

Edit to add: I knew very little about the show before watching. Just Charlie Sheen, huge in America and made by the Big Bang guys. And it was when I liked Big Bang."
Bitten,"It's similar to why Big Bang Theory gets hated on. It was much higher rated than the most critically acclaimed comedies so people associated it with dumb people. It came out at an innovative time with shows like The Office, Arrested Development, 30 Rock setting the stage for non laugh track comedies, so 2.5 Men being the highest rated of them of all but the least creative and as mentioned one of the all time most flanderized shows pissed people off"
Bitten,So... brave...
Bitten,"I've only seen a few episodes. But it was about two middle-aged men banging all the women in Malibu. 

I hate Ashton Kutcher."
Bitten,The IT Crowd had one
Bitten,"When the laugh track is going full force at something I found entirely unfunny, I cringe harder than Michael and Jan's Dinner Party episode.  "
Bitten,[deleted]
Bitten,It was filmed in front of an audience
Bitten,I bet his meat was bloody tough.
Bitten,It definitely fits with Big John Umber's character. I don't think they need to cover it up or explain it away.

Boys Over Flowers,"But at what cost? We've already lost a lobster and a dolphin, I don't know how much more I can take"
Boys Over Flowers,So glad Kripke finally found success beyond supernatural
Boys Over Flowers,"Great show, great end, can’t wait for s2"
Boys Over Flowers,"> *The largest share of viewing to “The Boys” was performed by viewers 35-49. This demo made up 39% of the total audience to the show’s average viewership over its first 10 days.

I bet Amazon is happy about that part."
Boys Over Flowers,"The show was so good. My favorite character is the ""Batman"" guy who was always just sitting there and never talked but everyone was always like ""you need to get your shit together; except you Batman guy you're killing it out there keep up the good work."""
Boys Over Flowers,"It’ll probably have good long tail views as well when people’s friends FINALLY GET AROUND TO WATCHING IT, KEVIN!!!"
Boys Over Flowers,"Kind of random part of the show I really liked is Homelander's gratuitous use of lazer eyes.  I feel like those only get used in superbeing vs superbeing fights or to cut open doors or whatever, and in a very controlled and hokey way.  To see a psychopath flippantly and messily dice people (and the various things behind them) in half on a regular basis was a powerful visual that drove home how truly scary Homelander is."
Boys Over Flowers,"Took me a month or two to finally believe the hype. I’m not a big tv person as i have a hard time staying focused on serous shows that require a lot of viewer attention. When I finally gave it a shot, I couldn’t stop. Finished it in two days,  I was rewatching episodes to make sure I got every detail. Honestly one of the best first seasons I could ask for out of a show. The casting is damn near perfect.

Edit: forgot to mention I’m not a fan of superhero movies, so it was an extra push to get me to actually sit down and watch it. Glad i did."
Boys Over Flowers,"What I loved most about the show was how it handled dark humour. Idk if I’m correct or not but many people nowadays associate dark humour with edgy humour(especially the type we find on the Internet), but “The Boys” executes dark humour with class.

Can’t wait for season 2!"
Boys Over Flowers,"Cue the comments saying the show's popularity on Reddit was still just astroturfing.

Antony Starr's performance as Homelander justifies that viewership by itself. He perfectly captures not only the charming all-American boy facade, but also the emotionally unstable narcissist underneath who might snap at any moment. It's downright captivating."
Boys Over Flowers,*He really does give the worst pep talks*
Boys Over Flowers,"The thing that took this show from good to great for me was showing that even the villains were not all evil.

A-Train genuinely loved his girlfriend but was forced to kill her out of fear for Homelander.

The Deep cared about aquatic animals and wanted to save them whenever possible, and *seemed* to be legitimately sorry for his actions by the end of the season.

Translucent appearantly spent most of his time with his kids and was a generally nice guy, at least according to Starlight.

Mesmer wanted to be a part of his daughters life and just wanted another chance to be a hero.

Stillwell was driven almost entirely by being absolutely terrified of Homelander.

Even Homelander himself was shown to have little chance of turning out any other way due to being raised in mostly isolation with no parents.

They took characters that in most other series would have just been these awful people and turned them into ones that had legitimate motivations for their actions."
Boys Over Flowers,that soundtrack was FIRE...
Boys Over Flowers,The Homelander is my homie
Boys Over Flowers,"This is pretty crazy considering how absolute shit is is to browse amazon show catalogue, lol. To even find that they have a video platform is a pain in itself. They really just need to make primevideo.com or some shit that isn't on the amazon website."
Boys Over Flowers,"Historically, with the exception of S1 of The Walking Dead, I've always hated over-the-top gore. Needless to say, the first episode completely traumatized me at first, but I find Jack Quaid so darn likable I kept watching. And then once we get Karl Urban - I was sold. Love love love it and looking forward to S2."
Boys Over Flowers,It's funny how Watchmen now has to live up to 'The Boys' standards... you'd think shows like The Boys and The Umbrella Acedemy would be chasing HBO's different take on superheroes...and now its the other way around.
Boys Over Flowers,"[The Boys](#s ""It's a shame Elizabeth Shue won't be in S2. She crushed her role."")"
Boys Over Flowers,They put enough in advertising to get people to give it a shot.  The show was good enough to get people to keep on watching.
Boys Over Flowers,"I was so sick of the super hero genre and was certain I would dislike this show.

I was wrong."
Boys Over Flowers,"Well deserved. I liked the different take on the ""superhero"" ~~troop~~ trope. No wonder it was renewed"
Boys Over Flowers,i'm still sad they cancelled The Tick.
Boys Over Flowers,Fantastic series! Homelander is now my favourite TV “asshole”
Boys Over Flowers,"I watched the entire series on vacation with my wife in Hawaii. Thanks Amazon! Just so it sinks in though, I’ll rephrase this:

INSTEAD OF ENJOYING AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE BEAUTY OF MY FIRST TRIP TO HAWAII, I BINGE-WATCHED THIS SERIES ON MY PHONE IN MY HOGEL ROOM.

Boys Over Flowers,"I thought that Butcher’s accent was embarrassingly bad, until I realized that’s the actors real accent. I’m dumb"
Boys Over Flowers,was the best Amazon original.
Boys Over Flowers,First 10 minutes scarred me for life but yeah great show lmao
Boys Over Flowers,Look I know the Deep is a shit bag like the rest but please give my man a break or some kinda redemption. At the very least quit having the poor dude accidentally kill animals in admittedly hilarious fashion lmao.
Boys Over Flowers,That's fookin' diabolical!
Boys Over Flowers,The gillfucking was great
Boys Over Flowers,"Just watched Doom patrol... not bad, but the boys been better"
Boys Over Flowers,Still bummed about becca cheating on billy. What a cunt.
Boys Over Flowers,"Unless I'm misreading, it seems like the figure of 8M is for the season as a whole, not per episode.

>The average audience size of “The Boys” during the first 10 days was 4.1 million people with an average of a little over 6 million viewers tuning in to its premiere episode alone. Within the first 10 days of its premiere date (July 26-August 4), “The Boys” reached nearly 8 million viewers **over its eight episode season.**

At any rate, it would be nice to see this put in perspective against other streaming content. Comparing it to broadcast shows, an average of 4.1M total viewers per episode would put it around 38th place, about equal to Kids Say the Darndest Things on ABC."
Boys Over Flowers,This is easily one of the best shows Amazon has. I'm glad the reception is as good as the show!
Boys Over Flowers,This show deserves all the recognition and more. Cant wait for season 2.
Boys Over Flowers,"Is it good for someone who hates superheroes (especially the MCU) but will make exceptions for offbeat or heavy stuff like The Dark Knight, Joker, Watchmen etc?"
Boys Over Flowers,"Fun Fact: I initially refused to watch this show because of how much goddamn advertising.

After hearing for real people that it was good,  I gave it a chance. It's pretty good. Nothing insane, but the writing is good, character/relationship development isn't instant. 8/10"
Boys Over Flowers,It’s a damn good show. I can’t wait for season 2
Boys Over Flowers,One of my favorite shows right now. I can’t wait for season 2. Hope they don’t rush things and up the budget for better VFX.
Boys Over Flowers,"Here’s my question: why is Nielsen even involved in the process?  Shouldn’t Amazon be able to figure the numbers out without them?  I blame Nielsen for killing off tons of decent shows over the years and was hoping that with the rise of streaming, that they would be out of the picture. 

Also, I love this show in particular."
Boys Over Flowers,"One of the best reviews of the show I’ve seen is 

“This show made me want to take a shower after every episode. 

I love it.”"
Boys Over Flowers,"You cast Elisabeth Shue, you get results."
Boys Over Flowers,I really have to give it up to the actors. Home lander is so convincing & terrifying.
Boys Over Flowers,"Plus all the people that Downloaded it off torrent sites...

So double that."
Boys Over Flowers,"Shameless plug: my gf is an actor in this show, but it's hard to find. When watching episode 2 on your phone, go to ""extra content"". There's a scene with her and Homelander. Most people probably won't know about it, so I thought I'd share. 😀"
Boys Over Flowers,"I think this was my favorite series of the year... Can't think of anything I enjoyed more.

I was a big fan of the Marvel Netflix series. With them all being canned, The Boys will fill that void for me. We only need 2-3 more spinoff series."
Boys Over Flowers,Diabolical
Boys Over Flowers,Such an amazing season and show. I can't wait for next season.
Boys Over Flowers,"That’s great, now release the second season :)"
Boys Over Flowers,"We really loved the boys, can’t wait for more episodes."
Boys Over Flowers,This is the type of superhero medium I want.
Boys Over Flowers,"Amazing show, very well written can't wait for s2"
Boys Over Flowers,Because it was freakin’ awesome
Boys Over Flowers,[deleted]
Boys Over Flowers,I find that show much more  realistic if in fact the world actually had superheros .
Boys Over Flowers,No one ever talks about that random fly that kept appearing and gets its own sound fx. It's happened more than a few times to be a coincidence.
Boys Over Flowers,"Might have something to do with it being an amazing, and refreshing, show."
Boys Over Flowers,Show of the year for me. And we had GOT finale this year..
Boys Over Flowers,Not just a great show but the most brutal criticism of modern America I've seen in a mainstream show.
Boys Over Flowers,Homelander reminds me of some of the pastor's at those mega churches.
Boys Over Flowers,I don’t think people can even comprehend how much we needed a superhero show where the main premise is that they’re all evil fuckers and dolphin killers... but we did.
Boys Over Flowers,The most WTF just happened show I have ever seen..
Boys Over Flowers,[deleted]
Boys Over Flowers,"Because it was ***good*** 

Season 2 will be even better. Just don't game of thrones season 8 or Last Jedi SW Episode 8 it and everything will be fine."
Boys Over Flowers,"This was everything and more that I needed from a superhero tv show. It's the only reason I bothered to get a Amazon Prime membership, and to take in all of the other great shows on there too."
Boys Over Flowers,I can't wait till season 2 and I hope they have them a bigger budget.
Boys Over Flowers,"I'm saying if there is some geezer up there with a big white beard, he's a world heavyweight cunt.


I'm sorry, did you just call God the c-word?


Yeah. He's got a hard-on for mass murder and giving kids cancer, and his big old answer to the existential clusterfuck that is humanity is to nail his own bleeding son to a plank. That is a cunt move. Come on, even you got to agree with me there. We should lob a fucking nuke at him, get it over and done with. - Billy Butcher."
Boys Over Flowers,Fuck you bring back The Tick.
Boys Over Flowers,"I enjoyed the show, but I really do not feel like it was as good as the hype made it out to be. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's how I felt because there were a few areas that just did not make sense with the way the people thought and acted."
Boys Over Flowers,My favorite show of this year. Maybe of the past several years...
Boys Over Flowers,"If you'd told me years ago that the Boys TV show would be better than Preacher, I'd have said that's possible but highly unlikely."
Boys Over Flowers,fucking diabolical.
Boys Over Flowers,Almost half as many as I assumed based on the number of Reddit posts about it.
Boys Over Flowers,Am I the only one who thought that this show was just ok. It wasn’t stellar but it wasn’t trash either it just kind of was for me...
Boys Over Flowers,"Such a great show, even the most generic angry dude had great depth like you could see each one grow its very well written"
Boys Over Flowers,Excellent show✌🏼
Boys Over Flowers,"Well deserved! One of my favorite new shows this year, can't wait for season 2"
Boys Over Flowers,I was skeptical of this show because my friend described it poorly. I still tried it and it was absolutely amazing.
Boys Over Flowers,"Rightly so, that show kicked *a lot* of ass."
Boys Over Flowers,"Finished it last night.   
Damn thing is amazing."
Boys Over Flowers,Fucking Diabolical!
Boys Over Flowers,Love this show. still have 2 episodes left. its just such a cool and interesting new take on the good guys.
Boys Over Flowers,"After loathing homelander for most of the season, that finale instantly made him one of my favorites. Dude is fucking dark."
Boys Over Flowers,Such a good show.
Boys Over Flowers,I didn't even realize that it was Antony Starr from Banshee.
Boys Over Flowers,"I enjoyed the show, but 'that accent' kept creeping between a sort of cockney and a sort of rough aussie."
Boys Over Flowers,My only criticism of the show is the awful British accent
Boys Over Flowers,"Great characters, great acting, interesting premise, good timing because everyone loves superhero content right now. Overall solid execution of a show. Hopefully s2 continues to be great."
Boys Over Flowers,most impressive. they have a hit on their hands
Boys Over Flowers,"Such a good show, tv perfection"
Boys Over Flowers,Started it with no knowledge of expectations and I loved it. Homelander is played  very very Well.
Boys Over Flowers,The boys was sick as hell. Can not wait for the second season
Boys Over Flowers,Great show. Better than the comic imo
Boys Over Flowers,"It was great. I wish it had more of an ending, but that's not how TV shows work unfortunately"
Boys Over Flowers,"It was a hell of a show, probably the best I watched this year imo. Between this and Undone I'm excited for what Prime has in store for the future."
Boys Over Flowers,"I couldn't believe it was so good. I remember being very skeptical, especially as I was a little disappointed with preacher (still a good show but very clear budget issues forcing a slower pace) and frankly The Boys' source material just isn't as good. I wasn't even going to watch the show until my dad recommended it to me and sure enough it was awesome. Watched it all in one night!"
Boys Over Flowers,"Hell ya, this was a damn good show."
Boys Over Flowers,Lovely
Boys Over Flowers,"Not surprised, excellent show."
Boys Over Flowers,"Great show, it is probably the best super hero satire and it comes at the right time with Marvel movies hitting so big.
That scene in the plane..."
Goosebumps,ROB HEUBEL IS AN AMERICAN TREASURE.
Goosebumps,Heidi. We no longer want to hit that. GET OFF MILF ISLAND

Goosebumps,"Wow he's gotten old. Wait, I've gotten old!"
Goosebumps,[deleted]
Goosebumps,Huge fan of his from the Naked Gun film series!
Goosebumps,"So that's his name! He's one of those guys that shows up in everything but never has a staring role, so while you recognize his face, you never really learn his name."
Goosebumps,Just make it anthology style for fuck’s sake.
Goosebumps,"Your...kidding. They are doing the ""teens unleash the books on the town"" story AGAIN?"
Goosebumps,HUEBEL RULES
Goosebumps,I don't know they appear to be doing the movie's plot all over again when the reason people loved the Goosebumps show was the anthology format.
Goosebumps,CORN MAZE!
Goosebumps,HUEBS! HUEBS! HUEBS! HUEBS!
Goosebumps,"Kind of excited for this. I enjoy horror and so does my 8 year old daughter. 

But it's kind of hard to find horror that isn't filled to the brim with violence, sex or religion being the hero of the story."

Goosebumps,Man programming has really gone downhill
Goosebumps,Have they ever mentioned Aziz at all? Don't follow them too closely but I loved Human Giant when it was airing
Goosebumps,Gonna be pretty soon that *I'm* the dead body he wants to show a random celebrity.
Goosebumps,"I don’t know, I think this is just the worst picture of him imaginable for this post."
Goosebumps,"Think he’s been grey for a while, he’s decided to stop dying his hair."
Goosebumps,"During lockdowns, he stop dying his hair, which he'd been doing since he was quite young."
Goosebumps,Ya anything other than an anthology is doing a disservice to the source material
Goosebumps,"Let's be real, having a cliffhanger every 5 minutes of a tv show wouldn't be the greatest watch lol"
Goosebumps,"I mean, that show exists. They made it. They adapted the books.

I don't really see the need to re-adapt them."
Goosebumps,Practical effects and bad 90s CGI too please.
Goosebumps,Yeah I don't know why Sony is adamant on that even though there are so many books in the series that could be adapted.

Goosebumps,"You can say it's extremely outdated and cheesy because well, it is,

but something about those disembodied heads floating around in the background as Carly Beth tries to unlock the door fast enough always gets me to this day."
Goosebumps,"Love goosebumps the best memories reading them and watching the show, I still throw them on in the background now for noise while tinkering.
 
I didn't realize this as a kid but there's a ton of times that the actors' Canadian accents drop because the show was filmed in Canada. Also Ryan gosling was in the say cheese and die episode"
Goosebumps,"They used to play this every year around Halloween at school, and it scared the shit out of me. The idea of a mask stuck on your face and increasingly bonding itself to your skin is scary even now"
Goosebumps,This and werewolf of fever swap. Watched those vhs on a loop.
Goosebumps,"Nothing will ever be as ICONIC as...

Carly Beth's duck walk."
Goosebumps,Disney is making a new series. I have low hopes of it being as good as the original. Especially with the details given.
Goosebumps,This is the exact one that has always stuck with me. Just absolutely terrifying as a kid.
Goosebumps,ERMAGHERD GERSBERMS!
Goosebumps,"I host a weekly podcast about growing up in the 90s, and we had a TON of fun talking about goosebumps, and this episode in particular:

https://generations.buzzsprout.com/2024899/11432565-goosebumps"
Goosebumps,"During the intro as a kid I would close my eyes and plug my ears when the dogs eyes would turn yellow and woof to the tune of the song.  

The show was no problem for me but that part of the intro fucked me all the way up"
Goosebumps,"I’m so glad you said that lol, I feel the same way. They scared the shit out of me as a kid, and they scare the shit out of me as a grown man."
Goosebumps,Werewolf of fever swamp was terrifying
Goosebumps,"Loved Goosebumps as a kid the books and the show, none of them really scared me but that episode had me scared for months lol"
Goosebumps,As a kid I noticed that they freeze framed the dog during that shot. You can see someone in the background walking who just freezes in place.
Goosebumps,"When I was a kid I would rent the vhs taped from blockbuster, they'd have 2 episodes on one VHS but the credits would still after the first but before the 2nd episode started.

It would scare me hearing the music come on and seeing the green ooze slide down the screen because my older siblings told me if you wait till the ooze reaches the bottom of the screen, slappy jump scares you so I always closed my eyes at the end credits.


Also I thought the model on the billboard that morphs was Michael Jackson for some reason"
Goosebumps,"I have a picture of the dog’s head photoshopped on a rapper’s body of him recording his verse in the studio.

It is my favorite pic and I would love to share it, but I have no link!!!"
Goosebumps,I love weird childhood memories.
Goosebumps,"> “The series follows a group of five high schoolers who unleash supernatural forces upon their town and must all work together — thanks to and in spite of their friendships, rivalries and pasts with each other — in order to save it, learning much about their own parents’ teenage secrets in the process.”

Awww come on! A huge part of why people love Goosebumps is the anthology storytelling!"
Goosebumps,"justin long is a modern horror icon to me, i love him in everything lmao. also i had no idea they were making another goosebumps show !! i’m interested"
Goosebumps,"I forgot about him, he was jn everything there like 02 to 08."
Goosebumps,So its the same plot as the Jack Black movie?  But now its highschoolers?
Goosebumps,"Based on the 5 most popular books?

My guesses:

Night of the Living Dummy

Monster Blood

The Haunted Mask

Say Cheese and Die!

One Day at Horrorland"
Goosebumps,Always really liked Justin Long. He's a frequent guest on the podcast Doug Loves Movies and seem like a very likeable and genuine guy. Happy for his success.
Goosebumps,*Why come you don't have a tattoo?*
Goosebumps,What a Scream King 👑
Goosebumps,Jeepers Creepers!
Goosebumps,Is this series gonna be like the old school scary version from back then or is it the Jack black version?
Goosebumps,He’s good in anything! I watched accepted like a 100 times lol
Goosebumps,I'm a simple man I see Justin Long I watch
Goosebumps,Yea Zerk poke that piggy!
Goosebumps,Hope this doesn't impact his availability for Tusk 2.
Goosebumps,Of course it does.
Goosebumps,I just wish this and the new Are You Afraid of the Dark were anthology series.
Goosebumps,‘Waiting’ is a good movie
Goosebumps,"Nice casting. I've run into him a lot over the years, him and his whole family are very nice people"
Goosebumps,From South Harmon Institute of Technology to Goosebumps
Goosebumps,"I’ve a strong dislike for him, ever since the Apple commercials."
Goosebumps,the fucking mac guy?
Goosebumps,Is Justin long the first scream king
Goosebumps,Art is dead
Goosebumps,Why won’t he just go away?
Goosebumps,Oh god NO!!! He was horrible in Barbarian
Goosebumps,He's just one actor I could never bring myself to give a shit about
Goosebumps,Looking for good walrus content I see
Goosebumps,He would've worked better as Slappy.
Goosebumps,He was great in dodgeball.
Goosebumps,Another Goosebumps show?
Goosebumps,Really happy he's acting regularly now.
Goosebumps,I remember him from back when he worked at the bowling alley in Stuckeyville. I hope he's doing well.
Goosebumps,Hope he gets to keep his Peepers in this one
Goosebumps,"I'd love an Animorphs show, but ideally with a CGI budget that's a bit better than CW's DC offerings. 

Still remember the attempted show with that one scene where they recognized the principal by the way he scratched the bag of his leg with his shoe"
Goosebumps,He was fantastic in Barbarian. If you're a horror fan I highly recommend. Easily my favorite spooky film of the year.
Goosebumps,"I guess this ends any hopes for a third movie. I know they weren’t great but my daughter absolutely loved them and has probably watched them 20 times each (and thus so  have I). 

If the series has a similar vibe, I’m sure she’ll be happy though."
Goosebumps,I hope Brandon and Bobby Long make an appearance
Goosebumps,He’s still alive?
Goosebumps,“Salutations”
Goosebumps,After barbarian? YES BITCH!!! YEA!
Bo on the Go!,"Baran bo Odar is an awesome name, sounds like it's from The Elder Scrolls"
Bo on the Go!,I watched Dark when it was all done last year in a week during a lockdown and it was the most fun watch of year. With these creators Netflix should have greenlit the first two seasons and have them shot back to back. The wait is gonna kill me lol.
Bo on the Go!,"I dig it. Kept feeling many parallels to A maze of death by Philip K Dick https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Maze_of_Death

Dunno if others picked that up too?"
Bo on the Go!,"*** SPOILER *** I would not be suprised, if this is a generation ship to another starsystem and the passengers are in a simulation for the duration of the travel, but someone took over the simulation in malicious intent."
Bo on the Go!,"Just finished it, good show, hope they get to make all seasons."
Bo on the Go!,"> “For us, it was important that in the first episode, really from the get-go, you feel unbalanced. It does feel a little bit like an 1899 historical drama piece, but something is off,” Friese said. “What we constantly do is play with expectations. You read a code and you expect something and you feel safe in that. You think you figured it out. We’re breaking that expectation, and then hopefully giving you a satisfactory answer. At least at the end of Season 3, but hopefully already during the very first season.


> Another massive leap happens in the season’s closing minutes, as members of the cast move to a different kind of ship in an entirely different century. If the show does continue for a Season 2, it’ll already be a third of the way to its ultimate destination, according to Friese and bo Adar. And there are already details in the show that they’ve dropped in to help them as they get later in the potential “1899” run.

> “We are giving a big answer in Episode 7 in Season 1. It’s not a constant, ‘Yeah, we fool you’ and then you see it in Season 3,” bo Odar said. “Season 1 is about establishing a big theme, a big thing. Let’s see if there’s a Season 2, and then we’ll start playing with that theme, and have a resolution ideally in third season. Again it’s, like ‘Dark,’ meant to be told in three seasons.”

> “We always know the endpoint, the ending of the journey, the biggest reveal of them all. Apart from that, during the process, you just find pieces that aren’t included in Season 1 yet, but you know that you want them to be incorporated at some point. It’s having some cornerstones to go to and knowing where you’re heading, but also being flexible to the things that happen around you to act as input,” Friese said.


Season one was great, and given their track record, I trust the showrunners to have a clear idea where to take the show next."
Bo on the Go!,"I really didn’t dig it at all, and thought it felt light years short of Dark. My problem is that there’s so obviously something twisty going on, and whereas Dark starts off with the definitive element of time travel and having the craziness unravel naturally, this feels almost reverse engineered to be a trippy mindfuck rather than it being the most interesting way to tell a story about what’s “really” going on, as far as we know from the finale.

I could see season 2 going in a direction that would be enjoyable to me, but season 1 felt like a lot of wheel spinning and unnecessary opacity."
Bo on the Go!,"I first thought the twist was that she was a patient, but wait that wouldn't have come in the first few minutes of the episodes. Maybe everyone would have been a patient and the father doing what he does it does make sense.

Then the true twist ""2099"" but why have a ship from 1899, what is the purpose? Was it a cryosleep for a longer journey? Are there more than those 10 or so survivors on the ship or were the rest from the ship (1899) part of the VR? Are the rest of the passengers still alive on the Prometheus (2099)? What is the point of the VR (if thats what it is?), is it to pass the time?"
Bo on the Go!,"I've heard this 'we already know how the show is going to end' line from Rings Of Power, Andor (implicitly) and now this. I'm not against the principle but feels like the people who make these shows are realising that people are getting a bit fed up of shows that go on endlessly without sticking a landing, and want the guarantee of a satisfying conclusion to consider starting a new show these days"
Bo on the Go!,I hope they have a good plan. I watched the first season and I felt like I wasted eight hours of my life.
Bo on the Go!,Three episodes in and I'm baffled with how bad the writing is. Yeah let's pick this random woman to be the doctor as if a crew for a ship this big wouldn't have a doctor.
Bo on the Go!,"""lots of incest"""
Bo on the Go!,"First episode was okay, 2nd episode was one of the most boring things I've ever watched on TV."
Bo on the Go!,"That’s cool at all to have a three-year plan but despite the fact Netflix went with them on dark, hopefully they still manage to make an interesting arc between the parts rather than spinning their wheels which it felt like a lot of the first season was, being superfluous￼. Also you can’t guarantee that they will retain the audience enough to get greenlit for two more seasons￼. They probably have a contract with Netflix but that doesn’t guarantee anything￼"
Bo on the Go!,Probably the mom.
Bo on the Go!,"lets hope they do seasons every year. it is so accepted to do seasons every other year, idea of it terrifies me."
Bo on the Go!,"Ha, binge watching Dark is cheating. Those of us who watched it as it came out had to use charts to remember who was connected to who between seasons!"
Bo on the Go!,"I'm just starting episode 7, and i don't know if i'm going to continue with 1899. I can best sum up this show with the meme:

""Momma, I want some Westworld Season 1""

""We got Westworld Season 1 at home (proceeds to serve up 1899)""

It really does start out not even trying to play it straight. A narrator saying ""something freaky deaky is going on with this ship"" wouldn't be any less subtle than the actual show.

And the writing. I won't spoil anything substantive, but i just got through an excrutiating ""Let me explain, don't you remember?"" scene - it dragged on for what felt like ages. The person trying to ""explain"" had EONS to just go ahead and blurt out what he was getting out, but we literally sat through a forever of ""Let me explain, please...   you must remember. Don't you remember? Please, let me explain. you must hear my explanation. My explanation, you should hear it. Hear my explanation, you should. Remember? Remember it? The thing i won't actually say because this scene would have been done in the 30 seconds it deserved and not he 15 minutes we gave it!""

It was painful. Really painful.

I'll probably still finish the show, just because i want to see where they're taking it, but I'm gonna be honest, it's feeling like sunk cost fallacy. if i  could go back in time, i'd probably council past me to skip this one."
Bo on the Go!,"I watched the first episode, and it was too much ""mystery wrapped in an engima"" to me. LOST flashbacks, and not in a good way."
Bo on the Go!,"At about 11:50 in ep 1, everyone takes a sip of tea at the same time. I'm pretty sure they're all (except the main cast) simulations... But who knows"
Bo on the Go!,"My guess the whole thing is like Vault 112 - Tranquility Lane simulation. Even the computer onboard reminds me of the Fallout PCs, a chunky CRT with an MS-DOS like interface.

Originally the simulation was to keep the passengers sane and active during such a long voyage in space, but Ciaran has gone mad and is creating all these weird background stories and scenarios to torture people for fun just like Stanislaus Braun in Vault 112."
Bo on the Go!,"I believe the simulation represents reality, although im
not exactly sure how. But it’s not a coincidence the spaceship that Maura is on in reality is called the Prometheus. I believe the reason Maura and Captain Eyk found their names on the Prometheus passenger list in the sim is because they are actually on the Prometheus in reality. Maybe the Prometheus in reality was lost in space like the sim Prometheus was lost at sea, and somehow the passengers in sim help the reality Kerberos locate the reality Prometheus? Or maybe the space ships are just the next level in the sim and there’s an even deeper meaning to it all.

Either way, I highly doubt Baran bo Odar and Janjte Friese would spend a whole season on the 1899 sim if it was just simply “to waste time” or “to distract/keep Maura trapped”"
Bo on the Go!,I mean if you've seen Dark they did exactly three seasons and it's almost perfectly wrapped up
Bo on the Go!,"Word of mouth for shows are so dependent on the ending. I have put off or ignored shows completely if I hear the ending isn't great (which does not mean the show isn't worth the ride).

I think producers and show-runners are more aware of how important the shows ending is. People are sick of shows that got too many seasons with no real roadmap."
Bo on the Go!,"....she's not the only doctor on the ship, they literally mention that in the first 10 minutes of episode one."
Bo on the Go!,If you finish the show there's explicitly a reason she knows so much about medicine.
Bo on the Go!,"It's possible for the showrunners to be able to release a new '1899' season next year.

While season 2 of 'Dark' came out 18 months after season 1 (December 2017 ), the 3rd & final season was released just a year (June 2020) after the second season (June 2019)."
Bo on the Go!,Tbf I had to do this while binging as well
Bo on the Go!,"Exactly my thoughts, too. I finished it due to the premise, but 70% of the show is people panting breathlessly in each others faces and having monologues with one another. ""I lost my wife and daughters.... I miss them. "" Cool, thats the next 10 minutes of my life gone. It could have easily been cut down to 3 or 4 episodes and nothing important or interesting would have been lost."
Bo on the Go!,It's so damn boring and I'm like at ep 4. I think I'm going to bail.
Bo on the Go!,That was a big hint that something was going on.
Bo on the Go!,"that was my thought as well that everyone who jumped was just a simulation. but in the final scenes of the season we can see the Chinese mom ""hibernating"" next to her daughter."
Bo on the Go!,Ling Ye's hand glitches in that scene as well.
Bo on the Go!,">“to waste time”

Could be as to pass the time in finding the Kerberos (different from the sim). There is more than one way to waste time and it could be beneficial. 

Great insight by the way."
Bo on the Go!,People are still scarred from game of thrones
Bo on the Go!,Yeah so why did the captain pick this random woman instead of an actual crew member doctor?
Bo on the Go!,"I honestly think that was due to an early renewal for season 3 (they announced it prior to season 2's release).  So the scripts were being written earlier than waiting for netflix to renew is some time after it debuts.   Though knowing there two showrunners, they're actively mapping out season 2 now."
Bo on the Go!,"Yeah, shit wasn't easy no matter how you watched it."
Bo on the Go!,Craster as well
Bo on the Go!,"Plot-wise the Game of thrones ending was fine, the showrunners just didn't earn it & get there the right way at the right pace. The neglect of Bran's character did a lot of damage, considering they were the only ones that knew how it would end."
Bo on the Go!,She's the main character??? Also the other doctor was involved. He did the autopsy on the young girl and everyone in the room dismissed Maura's complaints when she argued against the doctor's findings.
Bo on the Go!,"> Italy’s 2,500 dubbing industry workers are on a protracted strike demanding higher wages, less frenzied work conditions, and protection against digital dubbing devices, which they claim threaten their jobs.


> The country’s unions representing Italian voice actors and dubbing directors have been on the war path since Feb. 21. On Tuesday they announced the strike will continue for at least another week.


> The unions are demanding that standard contract wages that have remained unvaried for the past 15 years be raised. But they are also clamoring for the right to be able to work at a slower pace, claiming that “current production rhythms are not conducive to [good] quality of work and of life,” according to a statement issued by Italian dubbers’ union ANAD. 


For people who might be wondering about 'Andor' thumbnail..


> Bianchi, a voice actor, is the regular Italian voice of international stars including Stellan Skarsgård. He most recently featured in the “Star Wars” series “Andor.” Bianchi said the time crunch prompted by more Hollywood movies going out day-and-date along with the increase in product that needs to be dubbed for the Italian market have been causing “an insane work rhythm where it’s impossible to maintain our quality standards that have been steadily deteriorating for a long time.”


> Italy, where local audiences until recently rejected subtitles en masse, “once stood out around the world for the level of excellence of its dubbing quality,” said Bianchi who as a dubbing director recently oversaw the Italian version of Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans.” “We want to work better, with more time at our disposal,” he noted."
Bo on the Go!,"A few years and AI will be able to completely translate movies with the voice of original actors. Good luck fighting for higher salary against a cheaper and more reliable option.

One of the first casualilty, AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore."

This is terrifying"
Bo on the Go!,AI making music. AI making posters. AI doing translations. It does seem like AI could end up taking over everything. Does that really benefit humans though? Maybe the rich executives. But everyone else? It seems like there should be limits on this.
Bo on the Go!,"Saw some article the other day taking about AI screenwriting, but AI can't generate ideas. To me, this is the real threat to writers - all of the non glamorous, non creative work. The day jobs. And not just for writers either, there are going to be hundreds of people who get put out of work because the computer can do it now. What will a day job look like in the future? Will everyone even be able to get one?"
Bo on the Go!,"That's just the direction we are going though. Why would I want to pay someone for one job when I can buy a program and have it do all types of jobs for me forever? 

Imagine how much we could get done. 3D printing for construction, automated vehicles, ai for education and a wide range of other things. 

Honestly there's no turning back."
Bo on the Go!,"We need to start enacting some form of measures to protect jobs regardless of how good AI is at doing them. I’m in support of protests like these. So long as we’re going to live in a capitalist world and jobs are going to be necessary, we need to take steps to protect them. People think AI taking jobs will happen slowly and will be resolved by it miraculously creating new jobs. This is only somewhat true. It will create *some* new jobs, but overwhelmingly it will delete entire career paths and this threatens to *massively* destabilize global economy. Companies and governments need to start enacting policies to protect those jobs or OTHERWISE abandon a capitalist system and start developing an infrastructure that can support people who can not work because of their job being replaced"
Bo on the Go!,"Oh wow, it’s almost like AI has no place in creative fields and will only realistically be used to screw over actually talented *people* because it’s cheaper.

What a goddamn surprise."
Bo on the Go!,"Yeah idk if not working is the solution to stop something that’s taking their jobs. But I side with the dubbers. It’s inevitable that studios will choose the cheaper option, but the use of AI needs legislation and fast. Either through taxation or general devaluing if AI is involved, something like a limiting MSRP on AI involvement, the free market never corrects things for the betterment of the disenfranchised. If it’s cheaper to produce, it should be cheaper to consume."

In which universe is listening to a robotic soulless voice better than enjoying the emotions conveyed by a real human? Just because it's cheaper and faster? I don't care how good the AI gets, as a human I want to see and listen to other humans. I crave human connection, and I want humans to tell me their stories and feelings through media. I don't care what a machine spews out, no matter how good it is, because it is a fucking machine.

Bo on the Go!,Aye yes.  Convince your employers to not use machines by making your own labor more expensive to use.  What could possibly go wrong
Bo on the Go!,So It sounds like automation can help lighten the load so they don’t work as much?
Bo on the Go!,"Who cares. Italians, just use subtitles like normal people"
Bo on the Go!,"There are already demos out there of software that can not only output text in the original actors’s voice but also change lip movement to match.  In ten years, dubbing will likely be a dead occupation."
Bo on the Go!,"A lot of streaming services already use machine translations for subtitles, and the result is often absolute trash; sloppy, mistranslations and mixing up words, direct translation of idioms, etc.  
  
Just yesterday I saw one show on D+ translate ""headshot"" into the ""shot in the head"" meaning rather than the ""photography used in the entertainment business"" meaning, saying a guy had shot his cat in the head many times (""he has many headshots of his cat""), which changed the tone of the scene rather drastically."
Bo on the Go!,"Yep. I'm a writer for a fortune 50 and pump out press releases, been doing it for ten years now. If I'm already testing AI to make by own job easier, you can bet your ass that my days are numbered.

These guys are pretty foolish to believe they're going to win this cause."
Bo on the Go!,UBI
Bo on the Go!,"Needed? No.

Should still exist? Absolutely. 

AI has no place in the creative fields and only braindead techbros think otherwise."
Bo on the Go!,">AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore.

People have been learning that continuously for centuries now, only difference here is that this is the first time ever that creatives are being bitten on the ass and they are doing what they do best: making drama out of the whole thing"
Bo on the Go!,"Luddites are actually a surprisingly apt analogy. Like these workers, they weren't against the machines themselves, they targeted companies that used machines to skirt labor laws. We have a lot better worker's rights now though so fingers crossed for this union. AI is like other tools in that it can be used inhumanely or horrifically, that's up to us."
Bo on the Go!,It requires training data and many new contracts are including the stipulation to use the VA’s lines in that data set.
Bo on the Go!,"It can't match human quality, but it's decent enough in many cases that bottom-line companies will go with that since it's vastly faster and cheaper. 

If you read ""AI""-translated stuff, it's generally about ~~80%~~ 90% ~~indistinguishable~~ raises no eyebrows, 9% correct but reads a little weird, and 1% things that are just not accurate or that haven't translated properly. For an exec or someone who is more concerned with the bottom line than conveying the spirit of the text, that's usually good enough. The problem then becomes, are enough people willing to pay for that extra level of quality to sustain an industry? The programs are being trained on the work of translators, but those translators are not seeing economic benefit from it. They are, in a sense, competing with their past work in a system where the bottom line is all-too-frequently the final word.

Economic concerns aside, the real killer is that iterative learning will always (at least so far as I've seen) favor textual fidelity over the voice of the text, and doesn't have the ability to make executive decisions based on outside knowledge. One of the benefits of a really good translator is that they understand the stuff that isn't being said, the metatext of language that accompanies and accentuates our diction and syntax. For example, *Les Misérables* (which has been translated into English at least 4 times, and possibly as many as 8 depending on how derivative a work can be before being considered its own translation) was written in the vernacular French of the mid-19th century. Victor Hugo was intentionally writing for a universal audience, but by modern standards his prose would be considered significantly elevated (in no small part because the style of writing he used became seen as respectable thanks to his work). One issue that translators have grappled with is, where do you split that difference? (Notably, Hugo hated the first (Wilbur) translation of the novel, he is reported to have declared upon reading it that ""translation is censorship."")

Of the translations, the three I want to look at are Norman Denny (1976), Julie Rose (2007), and Christine Donougher (2013). These are generally agreed to be the best available (fun fact, an 1863 edition had the anti-slavery parts excised so it could be sold to Confederate soldiers during the Civil War!) and anyone looking to read Les Mis in English is generally steered towards one of them. (Maybe less so Denny these days, but of the 20th-century translations his is the best-regarded)

However, they have vastly different approaches to the language and structure of the story. Denny chose to make editorial alterations to language and remove parts he considered irrelevant to the overall story being told, an interesting choice considering Victor Hugo's insistence upon the importance of his digressions. He favored an ""old-feeling"" voice, to make the novel feel its age. [The opening page as per Denny, including a somewhat representative phrase:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-denny-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was said of him that his father, intending him to inherit his office, had arranged for him to marry at a very early age, about eighteen or twenty, following the custom that was fairly widespread in parliamentary families.""

Rose, by contrast, kept everything in but ""modernized"" the language, stating that she wanted it to feel to a reader like they were relating to the text in the same way that a 19th-century French reader would have. [Her first page, with the same line quoted below:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-rose-les-miserables-1.png)

>They reckoned his father had put him down to inherit his position and so had married him off very early in the piece when he was only eighteen or twenty, as they used to do quite a lot in parliamentary families.

Donougher seeks to find a middle ground, updating the cadence to be accessible to readers without using the same level of explicitly modern language. [Her introduction to the bishop, and that same line:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-donougher-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was reported that his father, intending that his son should inherit his position, had married him off very young, aged eighteen or twenty, a fairly common practice among parliamentary families.

The same information is being conveyed in all three of these, but the voice of the translator is evident.

Now, imagine you want to do an ""AI""-driven translation of Les Mis. How on earth do you begin to parse this? Do you train it exclusively on French from the 19th century? Exclusively on Hugo? Do you feed it every Les Mis translation we have, or the collected works of a single translator? Issues of ownership aside (and I would argue that any translator would have very solid grounds for legal action if their translations were used to create a new translation that did not include them in profit-sharing), the voices are not just divergent, but actively trying to do different things, and no program can even come close to matching that."

I do want to applaud the inclusion of ZeroZeroZero. It’s been overlooked and it’s an excellent show. Amazon did it dirty by releasing it the same time as their misfire about Nazi hunters and failing to promote it."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Hey random reddit reviewer,

I've been using your reviews for several months now (since quarantine began really). You write a lot of them, so they're a great litmus test for if a new tv show is worth the time investment. even if I enjoy watching some schlock a lot more than you.

Please don't let these naysayers down your spirits. Even if some might be struggling to understand why you would rate non-schlock 100%-attentive shows so highly. There's more scripted content these years then ever before, so when someone starts naming their favorite shows that aren't part of the broader talkoshere, they get worried that they haven't invested their time in the cream of the crop. 

My favorite new show this was probably We Are Who We Are. I have had Desenfranadas on my netflix queue for so long theyve changed the name of it to something else, so I'll need to catch up to that one.

One last point; I think a lot of people here think everyone derives enjoyment from run-of-the-mill comedy/fantasy/sci-fi big budget monstrosities/""guilty pleasures"". I can find things to like in these, like the soundtrack and the production values, but I truly look foward to tv shows that try something different. Your guides have been a great source of that.

Cheers,
Fellow avid tv show consumer


Edit: i didnt see at first you put My Brillian Friend s2 on the list. I love Richter's soundtrack for this one so much I've learned most of it."

Transformers: Rescue Bots,Interesting list and write-up. Haven't seen or heard about these shows much but I'll definitely check out those Netflix shows. Thank you.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Everyone's ganging up on you because you aren't a normie (welcome to contemporary US television audiences). I want to say keep on trucking. Every art field has a lot of xenophobia in US mainstream culture, but maybe none more so than television. I looked at several top critics' picks this year that had a top twenty with nary a pick outside the US/UK.

Surely someone outside the US/UK has made quality television. I mean, the critics that have looked at movies have done the bare minimum and found at least a few year in year out. And all television really is is a bunch of short movies that follow some sort of theme or idea.

All of that said, while you give luscious descriptions I don't know if many of these things interest me. I'm kind of done with the post-2010's melodrama and Rich People Problems stuff. Tower of God and ZeroZeroZero sound cool, though."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,the fact that attack on titan isn't on here is a crime
Transformers: Rescue Bots,is OP a feminist?
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Great list, keep up the great work"
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"I am so glad Dave made this list. I have been a Lil Dicky fan since he first started getting big on Reddit. I wasn't expecting a lot from the show, so when I saw it I was dumbfounded. I would recommend that to anyone."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Bad list is bad.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Am I the only one who feels like nothing good aired this year besides What We Do In The Shadows? I blame COVID.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,You should watch Normal People on Hulu. It'll end up on your list.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Pretentious, but not as pretentious as av club."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,You need to branch out A LOT.   You have some very odd tastes but I guess that’s just what you like.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"*Tower of God* but no *Re:Zero*? Damn. 

Even if I very much disagree with Re: Zero being left on any list. I’m glad to see one without *Lovecraft Country*. That show was such a dumpster fire I’m not sure how any competent person could watch it and says it’s good, let alone one of the best of the year."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Do you tell people that you own many leather bound books?
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Hey, have you watched: Alex Rider, Alice in Borderland, Someone Has to Die, The Flight Attendant, The Great, To the Lake?

I've been reading some of your reviews and you write pretty well, although I don't necessarily agree with all your opinions."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"I wasn't aware that Juno Temple was in another project titled Little Birds, so I thought you randomly threw a 2011 film on the list. I will have to check that out, as well as a few others."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Sounds like you would like Suburra on Netflix based on this list.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Part of why I love end of the year lists is that I often discover shows (or movies) I never knew existed and/or am given a reason to try a show I might have skipped.  Your list definitely inspires that.  Bonus points for articulating why the shows worked for you.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Tower of god (webtoon) is one of my favorite pieces of writing ever. The anime isnt that great imo
Transformers: Rescue Bots,What a great list. But please refrain from adding Japanese shows. No way that any is worthy of the top 25.

What show do you mean?"
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Haven’t heard of zerozerozero but it sounds right up my alley. I’ll check it out, thanks"
Transformers: Rescue Bots,yep OP is definitely suffering from Wokeism
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"I like that OP sticks to their guns, but some of their choices are not great to me.

Desenfrenadas in particular I found just laughably bad in how clumsily it tried to present real meaningful subjects but fell terribly short with its transparent privileged fantasy idea of what struggle in the ground looks like. It takes checklist, cliched characters that it thinks will benefit from a taste of ""real life"", but the test it makes them endure, beneath the thin layer of modern coating is terribly old fashioned and cliched too and it doesn't realize ever seem to realize its vision of reality is just testament that no one involved has ever gone on a crash course road trip in places like the ones it depicts. I found the all the leads (besides lucia bracho, who is the best, deserves better than this and I hope gets a vehicle soon) wooden, stiff, perpetually-instagram-posed and unlikable.

Also, it didn't help that it's just the exact kind of ""nuMexico vibe"" mexicans like me are extremely tired of.

And even after all of that, it just doesn't have a great structure. I had to hyper sweep the show for a sort of documentary job and it has a lot of cracks. 

But I also thought my brilliant friend s2 was great, even if it fell quite a bit shy of S1 for me, which I just adoooored. So we're a bit in tune maybe."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"OP is of course free to like whatever they like, but I think the reason people are giving them grief is more because they give off a really strong vibe of pretentiousness.  Personally I'd love to be introduced to new stuff outside the mainstream, unfortunately nothing in the OP's list that I haven't already seen really sounds all that interesting."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"not the first time seeing someone asking for this in the U.S. but unfortunately no i don't think it's available in the U.S. It's actually even available in Canada apparently but not the U.S.

Transformers: Rescue Bots,Honestly it was bait to see if OP would show themselves to be pompous and of course they were lol
Transformers: Rescue Bots,[removed]
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Literally their #2 and #23 on their list is season 2 of a show. So you’re wrong.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Did you write any reviews by any chance?
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"This is old as hell, and I just came across this looking for new shows, but having just finished hunters... I loved it? I thought it was fabulous, save for maybe the very last 20-30 minutes of the final episode."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"> So much drama, heart, personal journeys, marriages, adultery, etc. in OP's descriptions, felt like my mom was describing what she wants in a show to me.

wait i thought we all loved a heartfelt drama about characters taking self-discovering journey to free themselves from the chains of an adulterous marriage. 😂😂"
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Eh, bringing in a bunch of foreign TV to an overwhelmingly young, American demographic, and then dismissing something popular as not being ""avant-garde"" enough for you, is kinda gonna come off as pretentious to many people.

You like what you like, and honestly, more power to you.  This is obviously a list that is personal to you, even if it doesn't conform to the ""mainstream"" enough for most people.  As someone who grew up listening to music well outside the mainstream and being mocked for it, I can totally relate to that."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,If the trailer is anything to go by script needed editing by somebody from England. The way the English characters talk is very unnatural.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Ted Lasso seems to be the pinnacle for a lot of ppl on here this year. 😄 it was good, just not avant-garde enough for me i guess."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Dude what!? ... I didn't say I was... I'm just wondering why are you asking here? 😕
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"But that is ""quality"" for me, as quality is a subjective thing, and that does determine how entertaining a show is for me. It is a criteria of sorts, but not for the list, it's a criterior for me. 

Originality, creativity and uniqueness, I'm literally telling you what I look for or want from TV shows. I'm telling you what my opinions are mostly based off of. That's all."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Besides the obvious ones (Tiger King and Queen's Gambit) what shows did u watch?
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"How lol. At the end of the day, shits subjective. It's just his opinion"
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"> Yeah that show and Ted Lasso not being on your list shows us all we need to know.

2020 TV had more to offer than these 2 shows guys c'mon. 😅 have y'all even seen my top 2?!

> A drawback for Normal People is that straight couples on TV/film are pretty fucking boring now.

Yea as i said I'm hella biased against this show. It's something i didn't particularly enjoy... but can't necessarily say it's *bad*. I don't know, maybe it's because it kinda reminds me of my favorite film franchise 'The Before Trilogy', acting like a cheap imitation of that. Or maybe because of the sex scenes that reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey... or idk, I just wasn't feeling it. 

> Just skimming your posts shows how much of a insufferable snob you are

Why? 😕 Because of that one line? It ain't that serious man it's all for fun and it's all opinionated. Me saying that is just how I felt at the time, I went on to love a lot of show focusing on straight couples, some of which are even on this list."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,No sorry. Only a short one for [Someone has to die](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/je2kuw/in_true_spanishdrama_fashion_alguien_tiene_que/).
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"I'll be honest, there's a lot of places where your list would be better appreciated than r/television. The demographic here is not suited for a list with so much foreign, dramatic, introspective content. People here are more in the male 18-34 demo, there's more focus on escapist shows. There's not enough comedy, sci-fi/fantasy, and action here for your list to be accepted. If you had kept the thread title as ""my favourite shows of 2020"", you might have gotten a slightly more positive response."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"i still don't see why it should, as i said at the beginning of the post ""*100% opinionated and personalized*""... but whatever if it's pretentious so be it, im not trying to be though... just listing what for me were the most noteworthy shows of the year. 🤷"
Transformers: Rescue Bots,The trailer is absolutely not the thing to go by.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Yeah, I don't rate shows on their avant-gardiness.  

Different tastes."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,I don’t know how you’re being downvoted for just giving a personal opinion. Great write up even if I don’t agree with all your choices.
Transformers: Rescue Bots,^ yeah.......
Transformers: Rescue Bots,">I'm telling you what my opinions are mostly based off of. That's all.

You asked why your list is begin called bad. Most people look for a lot  more than just  ""originality, creativity and uniqueness"" and that's why people don't like your list.  That's all."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,Lol I didn’t watch tiger king. That show is for idiots
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"You might be right about the demographic being hostile to my current taste... but on the contrary, I feel like the very heartwarming Ted Lasso and slow-burn heartbreaking romance drama Normal People being popular here proves that shows like these can be accepted. It's not really a matter of taste or me favoring the avant-garde too much, it's a matter of what's mainstream or what's popular. I think a lot of people just want to see shows that they've watched and regard highly whenever they see a ""Top TV shows of the year"" list. 

> there's a lot of places where your list would be better appreciated than r/television

like where? I feel like this is the only place someone like me could come and post about tv shows and actually have people see and read it without having to worry about gaining followers or building an audience, because the audience is already here. But if you know of any other place please do suggest. 

> If you had kept the thread title as ""my favourite shows of 2020"", you might have gotten a slightly more positive response.

But.... that's exactly what it is. As I said in another comment here, art is subjective, and any end-of-year list you see, whether posted on AV Club, Deadline, Variety, YouTube etc. will always be the author's opinion and limited to what the author has seen this year. Go on Variety and look at one of their ""Top TV Shows of 2020"" list.. now look at name of the author in that little box below the title, that's their ""favorite TV shows of 2020"". This is a fact that just seems to fly over a lot of people's heads here for some reason."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"lol yea as i said at the start of the post, originality, creativity and uniqueness are my 3 main factors, whether in storytelling or execution (because I watch a lot of shows you see I latch on to anything even slightly avant-garde 😅). 

[Here's my sum up of Ted Lasso](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/j4hjmv/another_ted_lasso_apple_tv_post/).... which looking back now could've been longer (guess I couldn't be bothered at the time to write down my full thoughts). I gave it a 7/10."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Im no expert, but saying “it’s not avant-guard enough for me” is basically farming downvotes. We all have our tastes. Is when we’re subscribing to a taste for its own sake we’ll have a hard time bringing others along with our opinions."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"thanks a lot. i really hate how much it seems to fly over users heads on here that lists like these will always be the writer's opinion... any end-of-year list, whether it's on Variety, AV Club, YouTube etc. it'll always be the author's opinion, and art is subjective."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Uggh I feel like you're still not understanding what I'm saying here lol.

> Most people look for a lot more than just ""originality, creativity and uniqueness""

I do too... good writing, good acting, beautiful visuals and good production values all round, but a lot of shows have those elements, what I'm saying is for me to consider it noteworthy or outstanding, originality, creativity and uniqueness are the 3 main factors that must be there... along with the essentials. 

> that's why people don't like your list.

Nah, let's admit most people come into posts like these expecting to see shows they've watched and regard highly, obviously this isn't that for most, so no i didn't make it expecting people here to like it.... but honestly it's going better than i expected. A lot of the comments are just misunderstanding me, guess i should've elaborated more in the opening NB. 

oh and p.s. it wasn't a serious *ask*, i just wanted the user to tell me what he thought about the list lol."
Transformers: Rescue Bots,"Ted Lasso is a comedy, it leans heavily on the goofiness of its main character. The funniest show you have on your list is... Dave? That's what I mean when I say your list is humourless.

You have so many shows on your list of people facing trauma or going through a personal journey. Most people don't enjoy that. People like watching escapist tv where characters are solving problems and going on actual journeys and landing in humorous situations, your list has nearly none of that. Your list takes the joy out of watching tv and makes it a chore.

And when you say stuff like ""what matters to people is what's mainstream and popular"", you will get called pretentious. Makes it seem like you don't care about the quality of a show, you only want people to know how unique and special you are. I don't think r/television only follows what is popular, it follows the higher end of what the male 18-34 demo follows, and it doesn't seem like you are part or at least don't understand that demo at all.

Also, lists like AV and stuff are usually a collaborative effort, so it's usually not just one person's opinion and meant to be more all-encompassing than a random video on Youtube. And you really don't see many random ""top tv shows of 2020"" Youtube videos being posted here. You'll probably see more vitriolic criticism being spewed at those videos in the comments than what you are getting in this thread."
Orange Is the New Black,Makes sense. Pipers free and most of the original cast are no longer on the show. There's no more material to go off on and to drag it on would be awful.
Orange Is the New Black,[deleted]
Orange Is the New Black,"End of an era for Netflix, along with HOC."
Orange Is the New Black,FREE BLANCA
Orange Is the New Black,"I expect no closure to the Daya situation at all. 

Outside of she dies. Like what happened there ? Wtf. :("
Orange Is the New Black,"Better to be remembered for good content and a strong ending.  Go out Six Feet Under style, and not Dexter style.  


Please."
Orange Is the New Black,"Every season has been so tonally different than the previous one, but I'm glad it's coming to an end. It's time."
Orange Is the New Black,"It was one of the shows that made Netflix a power house. When people started ""cutting the cord""."
Orange Is the New Black,"I figured it would be the last season, with Piper talking about writing a book and all. I actually didn’t mind the most recent season, but it’s time for it to end."
Orange Is the New Black,"Even though it is one of my all-time favorite shows and I'm gonna miss it, I think this is good news, I would be worried if they announced there would be a season 8, I can't think of many dramas that have gone for more than 7 seasons and still maintain their quality."
Orange Is the New Black,Caputo spinoff plllleeeeeeaaaaase!!!!  I love that character so damn much. Let him decide to keep fighting for women in prison and maybe track down the guards daya fucked over (sorry I know I was supposed to be on her side but I just can’t...pornstache was awful but 2 wrongs don’t make a right). Through him the heart of the series could live in and could be even better branching further outside the prison walls. 
Orange Is the New Black,"Happy and sad to see this show go. Reddit really hates this show, but it's one of the most consistently-delivered shows in a while. Every season has been fresh and different from the other. I loved the last season."
Orange Is the New Black,Whatever makes that damn song stop.
Orange Is the New Black,The riot season ruined it for me. The series peaked on the “Vee” season. I’ll miss the actress who plays Boo the most. Piper became so boring as the show progressed.
Orange Is the New Black,"I know a lot of people really dislike what happened to the show, but it's consistently been my favorite show on television since I found it. Sad to see it go, but glad that they get to end it on their own terms! :D"
Orange Is the New Black,I fucking love this show. I didn't know so many people hated it until I clicked on this thread
Orange Is the New Black,"I absolutely love this show and have watched it since day one. The first series was superb but it went downhill - but with good reason. At one stage (I believe around S2) half the writing team were fired by the creator. That's why different seasons have entirely different vibes to them, the writing team changed more times than a chameleon changes color. It seemed after the huge success the creator seemed to run it into the ground changing the genre and narrative constantly throughout the show. It went from being drama to a comedy back to drama then a mix of both. It was constantly shifting its genre which displaced the audience because the creator simply couldn't make up her mind on which way to go with it, and with constantly changing writing teams and strict deadlines it's why each series kept falling short of expectations. 

They then also began to sell out. Ruby Rose for example. An utterly pointless character who was just there for young lesbians to gawp at whose storyline completely destroyed the main protagonist's romance (and by far the most successful part of the show was Alex and Piper's relationship). It was badly written, utterly needless and all it did was make a diva out of Ruby Rose (see her throwing food at waiters and other numerous incidents just by googling her antics).

But besides that - it got dull. All the episodes were molding into each other and became easily forgettable. Piper went from being semi-likeable to intensely hated. And they didn't get away with this move because she is the main character and they immediately switched her back the following season. She went from being scared and relatable to try hard gangbanger to normal again. They tried mixing it up in all the wrong ways. It wasn't believable. 

They ruined Red. Introduced as a powerhouse and fascinating badass character, to wimp and cry baby by season 2. They even changed how she appeared (different hair color, different body language) so it was like a brand new character in S2. They made a complete mess of such a fantastic character by watering her down. 

Soso was literally a walking talking stereotype for the 'annoying asian chick'. I fast forwarded through her scenes constantly, what a frustratingly annoying character. 

[SPOILERS]: 
What about that storyline with Tiffany (Pennsatucky) being raped and then her dating the guy and the show even trying to make the audience like him again? Pretty strange move from the writers. 

Also, Piper has left prison. She's the main character. Times up. 

I'm sad to see it go - Alex is by far the only reason I watched it any more. But I can see why it needs to end now. "
Orange Is the New Black,"Haven't seen any of this show, does it stay consistent throughout or are there clear seasons to skip or a drop off point like House of Cards?"
Orange Is the New Black,Holy shit. Things have not gone well for Leslie Knope in that thumbnail. 
Orange Is the New Black,"I really liked the first season. The last two seasons were pretty bad. Didn't even bother finishing the most recent season. 
"
Orange Is the New Black,"I think it was a great show until the riot and its aftermath.

The original setting was perfect to focus on characters, their backgrounds, and the complexities of the prison-industrial system.

There was no need to disrupt that with an event as game-changing as the riot, in my opinion "
Orange Is the New Black,Jesus finally.  Here I was thinking it was going to turn into Netflix's Greys Anatomy.  
Orange Is the New Black,"Good, they're really slipping with this latest season. Sometimes it feels like they're in some adult day care center then prison."
Orange Is the New Black,"The later seasons rebounded a bit, so they aren't ending on a whimper - but it is time to go."
Orange Is the New Black,"Seven seasons? What the....where did the show go after Donna Pinciotti got out of jail? Did that erotica novel the one lady wrote ever get published? The show really “walking dead-ed” for me after the third season. Maybe fourth, i don’t remember. "
Orange Is the New Black,"It’s had its ups and downs but the last season was good. The only weird part was that throughout the whole series, they acted like going to Max was the scariest thing on Earth, and yet it was mostly the same situation, just...half the cast is gone, and they’re caught up in other people’s beef. And it had the Florida area, which was the cushiest place in the prison. "
Orange Is the New Black,It’s still on?
Orange Is the New Black,Lost me after season 1
Orange Is the New Black,I missed Boo on this show.  This last season just wasn't the same without her.
Orange Is the New Black,"Wait, season 6 wasn’t the finale? Jesus fuck! That show is so much boring filler garbage."
Orange Is the New Black,[deleted]
Orange Is the New Black,If only The Walking Dead would take the hint
Orange Is the New Black,"I wish I could say I was sad, but I’m not.

Just happy Netflix gets to throw more cash at a new show that people actually want to watch."
Orange Is the New Black,I didn't even see anyone talk about last season and have no interest in it. 
Orange Is the New Black,"Now go watch Wentworth, which made me stop watching OITNB seasons ago

"
Orange Is the New Black,"Should have ended with season 1 honestly. 

Edit: can someone give me some spoilers? I stopped at season 2. Is she still in jail somehow? What are some major plot points? "
Orange Is the New Black,I'm going to miss my lovely Pensatucky :(
Orange Is the New Black,"Can't think of another show other than this, where I hated the lead character more than all the others."
Orange Is the New Black,I stopped watching this show like in season 3. 7 seasons is too long for a Netflix show.
Orange Is the New Black,"I understand we all have opinions and it seems a lot of people aren’t fans of the newer seasons, but I think there are endless stories to tell about people being in jail, how they got there, what events lead to them performing whatever act got them into jail, etc. It’s definitely an interesting subject matter. Not saying it shouldn’t have an ending but I thought every season was interesting in some way just because of the change in situation or setting (the strike and then being in Max) and for that I appreciate the show, it’s definitely not my favorite show, but it’s very solid. "
Orange Is the New Black,thank god
Orange Is the New Black,I find 7 seasons to be the magic number for shows. Anything after that and I feel the show starts to go down hill fast.  Just in my opinion ..
Orange Is the New Black,I quit during season 2.  I can't believe it's continued for so long.
Orange Is the New Black,So many shows ending next year!!! 
Orange Is the New Black,"I think it's time for the show to end, it's clear they have lost the rich plot development of the first 4 seasons.  Season 5 was one episode worth of material stretched into an entire season, 6 was only marginally better.  

At this point it's an almost shameful knockoff of HBO's OZ, right down to the character flashbacks and carbon copy characters."
Orange Is the New Black,I read a spoiler that poussey died so I didn't watch that season and the rest. 
Orange Is the New Black,Non-spoiler question: i know nothing about this show. Is it worth watching? Does it go down in quality in later seasons?
Orange Is the New Black,Yay
Orange Is the New Black,"Should have stopped with season 6, I think. "
Orange Is the New Black,"haven't watch it since season 1... wasn't the lead only meant to be in prison for 1 year ... is the pie fucker still in it, i liked him?"
Orange Is the New Black,So sad. 😟
Orange Is the New Black,Finally 
Orange Is the New Black,Yay
Orange Is the New Black,Finally. 
Orange Is the New Black,Ran out of stuff to steal fron Oz
Orange Is the New Black,Oh thank fuck
Orange Is the New Black,Only about 4 seasons too late.
Orange Is the New Black,"How did it even get to season 7?

The show isn't great."
Orange Is the New Black,Good. It’s not been good since season two. 
Orange Is the New Black,Kinda got bored halfway thru season 6 and quit. Worth finishing?
Orange Is the New Black,It managed to make a prison riot boring.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes!
Orange Is the New Black,"I see more comments about people whining about the hate this show gets than actual hate for it, wtf"
Orange Is the New Black,Good. The show has sucked for 2 seasons
Orange Is the New Black,I loved the first season. But it lost me during the second season.
Orange Is the New Black,"Wait, that's still a thing?"
Orange Is the New Black,"The show became complete shit once they started shoehorning in all the social justice shit and making it out like the female prisoners were the good guys and the guards were the bad guys.

Like making a prison riot out to be a good thing. And watching people cheer as these convicted criminals took a gun from a prison guard shot him.

What a fucking joke."
Orange Is the New Black,This show is trash 
Orange Is the New Black,four seasons too late
Orange Is the New Black,"ITT ""I stopped watching after Season _____""

Fukin hipsters... "
Orange Is the New Black,I don’t understand the hype behind this show
Orange Is the New Black,It’s still on? 
Orange Is the New Black,Good
Orange Is the New Black,Season 7?! Jesus. I watched the 1st and got bored with the second and stopped watching. I felt like this show was on like season 4 at most. 
Orange Is the New Black,"How it went on this long is beyond me. 

Horrible writing, terrible acting, and ridiculous situations. The first season I actually sort of enjoyed, it went downhill fast season 2, and then got absolutely stupid from then on. 

Glad it's ending."
Orange Is the New Black,"How has this dumb show lasted so long. 

"
Orange Is the New Black,Finally 
Orange Is the New Black,Should have ended season 3
Orange Is the New Black,if it has to be then it will. 
Orange Is the New Black,Season 7 Is the New Beginning 
Orange Is the New Black,Piper got out at the end of last season so it sort of makes sense. 
Orange Is the New Black,Very smart and good call.
Orange Is the New Black,Nooooooooooo!!! 
Orange Is the New Black,"I loved this last season, I will be sad and glad to see it end with direction and dignity. "
Orange Is the New Black,"Yeah season 6 was really weird seemed to be going down the ending road. It was a good show, gotta end sometime I suppose "
Orange Is the New Black,"I rather it end well in 7th season than drag it along through 5 more and get boring. 
Everybody's got an arc and an ending, so this feels like the best choice.

I'm still sad because I LOVE this show."
Orange Is the New Black,It jumped the shark about two seasons ago...
Orange Is the New Black,First two seasons were great then it went downhill so fast.
Orange Is the New Black,"Wish the show was actually about the main character that was established in Season 1. She basically didn't exist in the last season.

Literally the main character, but you know, who needs those?"
Orange Is the New Black,"It’s been a rough ride, but it’s time."
Orange Is the New Black,It should’ve ended after season 2. That show got to be too much insanity. Piper was the worst character too.
Orange Is the New Black,"Thank gosh, it’s been way too long and far fetched.  "
Orange Is the New Black,Huh. I thought this last season (6) was the last. The ending seemed like it kinda wrapped everything up neatly. 
Orange Is the New Black,Thank god
Orange Is the New Black,One word:  Wentworth.
Orange Is the New Black,Long overdue.
Orange Is the New Black,Watch Wenworth. It’s so much better. 
Orange Is the New Black,Good.
Orange Is the New Black,Jeeeeeesus. Has it really been 7 years?
Orange Is the New Black,What about House of Cards?
Orange Is the New Black,I stopped watching middle of season 5(?) when they had those prison personnel singing or something. It’s just cringy.

Bleach,"Been really enjoying the series so far, bit annoyed there's going to be this long break but hey, waited a decade for more Bleach content, I'll cope with a few months"
Bleach,"Everyone always talks about how stylish and cool Bleach is, and they’re not wrong, but I’ve always thought an under appreciated element of the series was it’s protagonist.

Of the “Big Three”, Ichigo was the only one who didn’t have a head full of rocks. He was angst-y, but not overly so. He was introspective in a way that you still don’t see often in protagonists of the genre. 

Granted there’s a lot of bias from me as I was introduced to the series as a brooding teenager, but I always related to Ichigo more than any other anime character of the time."
Bleach,I hope the anime ends better than the manga did. The ending was super rushed and didn’t even get to see certain bankais that were teased.
Bleach,Do I have to have finished the OG anime run to understand what’s goin on in this? I always get stuck on the Bount arc
Bleach,I hope the animators get the rest they need.
Bleach,Fuck that's so long away. Part 1 was so good.
Bleach,Bankai!
Bleach,It has all been so worth the wait.
Bleach,omg last 2 ep so good  story so good
Bleach,"Never really was into Bleach (and have no desire to start up another shonen from the beginning these days) but have absorbed some plot over the years via social osmosis... randomly put on the new series and had a great time. Animation is top notch and it's not difficult to follow until like ep 6 when I finally needed to Google a thing or two, but by then was already hooked."
Bleach,Let us see if they rewrite the story well going forward.
Bleach,"Just finished the last episode of the first season. Am I in my thirties now and I shouldn't be so emotionally invested in children's anime? Yes. Do I care about it when Number One hits? Not for a goddamn second!

The adaptation is genuinely fantastic, and the animation is incredible, and since the audience is much older than when the original show aired the adaptation has aged with them, the show is much more graphic (if the plots demands it) than the original. It almost works on its own and I wish I could recommend it to others but, to enjoy it properly you need to have seen the previous series to appreciate everything. And I have hard time recommending original series to anyone without knowing they are prepared to skip all the fillers and prepared to deal with constant skipping as the original series can sometimes have 6+ minutes of recap which is terrible for binge-watching.

I hope when things are done, they'll take a look at the original series. I genuinely think the show could be recut into a ~100-episode abridged series if you leave out all the filler, cut out some of the pointless gags inserted to fill time, the terrible mid-episode break, and some repeating shots that are inserted there purely to fill time. It's hilarious how ""filler"" episodes have better pacing than some of the canon episodes because they spread it over 3 episodes purely for more time. I think the material is there, they just need to let someone put it together."
Bleach,how many total episodes are there currently for Part 1? Stopped watching so i could wait for all of part 1 to be released so I can binge
Bleach,"Wait bleach is still running?

I thought the manga was finished?"
Bleach,Do you need to watch the original to understand this?
Bleach,"I hope they do a an AOT S3 and do an upgrade change to the writing of the show.

The last half of the blood war arc in the manga was horrifically bad and the ending was 
 so bad it was an all time pants shit."
Bleach,"I know this anima has been around for a while, but has it already been 1,000 years?"
Bleach,"Man I was excited for more bleach, but I’m kind of sad that this is the direction they went.   I don’t dislike it, but it doesn’t capture any of the magic that the early seasons did and it comes across as mostly fan service. 

I’ve never read the manga, but the soul society/aizen arv if bleach is amazing…I was hoping for something like that."
Bleach,Can I watch the new bleach if I never watched the original?
Bleach,"It’s not what it was In terms of looks but it’s definitely interesting to see where the production takes it.

Glad they didn’t just discontinue it permanently. 

And here’s to hoping they don’t screw it up. 

Ban..Kai!"
Bleach,Well I’m now glad I’m waiting to binge watch it all when it’s done
Bleach,I just want to know if they will bring back the 3 mod souls from the filler arc that they shoehorned into the vizard/arrancar arc. I always thought that was a strange decision.
Bleach,Part one has been soooooooo fire!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bleach,"If people are this hyped about Bleach again, I gotta re-read the manga. 
I remember just hoping if this week’s chapter was finally the end because it felt like the story went to shit and powers didnt make any sense anymore. It made me really sad because I loved Bleach and grew up reading and watching it. 
So I guess I’ll give it another read and possibly watch the new anime"
Bleach,always nice to see anime creep up here
Bleach,I'll take 7 months over 10 years between episodes.
Bleach,Thankfully I’ve decided to rewatch most of the series since I’ve forgotten the story line. Hoping the series isn’t dropped by Disney before I get to TYBW
Bleach,"I think he also benefits from his motives, at the end of the day ichigo just wants to protect what’s important to him and have a chill time with his friends and family. He’s not always shouting about becoming the head captain, or the shinigami king. He just wants the strength to protect what’s important to him. He has lapses in self confidence you don’t often see in the genre too."
Bleach,"It's underappreciated because he's a reactionary character.

It makes him relatable in that his goal to protect his friends is very personal, but it also makes him...well, less compelling to follow because he has no 'goal' to follow or something to strive for if his family isn't being threatened. His goals are like...have a nice life and find a good job, which is good for a slice of life, not for an action shonen lol

Love Ichigo."
Bleach,"However, all the ‘he’s half every race ever in the story’ destined chosen one schtick is more than a little tiring and definitely common in shounen."
Bleach,"If you're talking about the big three I'm assuming Bleach, Naruto, and One piece. Look at their childhood. Ichigo grew fairly normal compared to Naruto and Luffy. Also Luffy might be on the spectrum. It make sense for each one of these characters being certain way."
Bleach,"He's also always overly confident when he overpowers but when he doesn't he's such a whiny little git.

His combat abilities peaked when he took on 3 vice captions bare handed very early in the story and then even dropped to having just his speed and one special attack move for the remaining hundreds of episodes lol.

He's a good character but he's not as developed as he should be."
Bleach,"> Of the “Big Three”, Ichigo was the only one who didn’t have a head full of rocks.

Clearly you haven't seen naruto who is a pretty witty guy in combat."
Bleach,"Ichigo are most greedy shonen main char, he have 4 power from all arc in series.. Holy shit"
Bleach,"Its a shitty protag, Luffy is funny and Naruto, at least, makes some jokes. This Ichigo is always angry and hitting his male friends. Just a big stereotype."
Bleach,The tone for the era was set by Dragonball and Goku is literally brain damaged.
Bleach,based on the pacing of the chapters I definitely think we'll see some extended fights that weren't shown on page.
Bleach,"Bount arc is filler and can be skipped, same with some of the other ones later on but yeah you might be a bit confused if you haven’t watched everything that occurred before"
Bleach,Do not watch the filler arcs. Look up a guide and skip the filler episodes.
Bleach,"Not really, of course it’s always best, but I haven’t watched any of the original either and just watched this recap video  on YouTube and I’m doing fine understanding it. 

https://youtu.be/1d0CQSMW3PA"
Bleach,Why are you watching the bount arc? You realize it's filler right?
Bleach,"Just skip the bount arc it isn’t important, it’s filler."
Bleach,"Yes it's a straight continuation.

That said the old anime is painful to watch. It drags and there's alot of filler.

I suggest the manga or reading/watching a summary."
Bleach,It’s only seven months. Not even a year.
Bleach,"In the manga the first half of the arc was great but the second half was historically bad.

Hope they’re changing how it went during the break."

Bleach,"Let me know if you find a YouTuber or video that recaps the series well

These long-ass animes got out of hand but they’re great ! Just so time consuming as an adult with so much great media out there"
Bleach,"To be fair, Shonen anime is aimed at teenagers and young adults. I think you are unintentionally perpetuating a common misconception about anime when you say it’s for children. I think it’s one of the reasons why so many Americans automatically think cartoons and anime are the exact same when anime is far more nuanced than that."
Bleach,"Wait, I’m OOTL. Is there a new adaptation of Bleach? Tell me more"
Bleach,13.
Bleach,It finished today.
Bleach,this is adaptation of the last arc. it was never animated as the anime was dropped before it reached this arc.
Bleach,always curious when people ask this question: what makes you interested in starting in the middle/end of a story instead of at the beginning of it?
Bleach,For sure.
Bleach,How can you say it’s fan service if you’ve not read the manga? 😭 you have no idea if it’s accurate or not
Bleach,"No. I mean, you *could*, but I would not recommend it. It's not a reboot or new series but the final storyline of the original manga. Going into it blind with no attachment to any of the characters and history would lose a shitton of weight. You can cut out a lot of the original series though, it has a high amount of filler and the actual episode count isn't nearly so daunting (for a battle shonen, anyway)."
Bleach,"Read the comic first, that’s easier than watching the show."
Bleach,"Hey, the people who downvoted this guy: Why? Why are you downvoting someone for asking if something is watchable with little to no context? What's the point of downvoting someone for jut trying to find out if he can understand something that's been posted here?"
Bleach,I agree and will wait to see it on anything but Disney+
Bleach,At least it not  7 months of filler.
Bleach,"I want to do a rewatch, and haven’t watched in over a decade since I was a teenager. I know I’ve probably missed a lot since then, and I remember being a ton of fillers — is there a list of must watch episodes without the fillers anywhere?"
Bleach,Definitely!  His goals are more profound than a mere title.  It also keeps him relevant for a lot longer in stories because protecting loved ones is a lifelong desire.
Bleach,"> I think he also benefits from his motives, at the end of the day ichigo just wants to protect what’s important to him and have a chill time with his friends and family. 

Generic shounen bad guy: ""Do you even know what you are fighting for? Why do you do fight?!""

Generic shounen good guy: ""...to protect my friends!"""
Bleach,"I actually disagree with everything you just said. He doesn't just wanna protect his friends and family. Yes that is his characters writing explicitly but he enjoys fighting and kicking ass. He is petty and has a massive ego and it hurts when enemies stomp him. He wants to get back at his enemies, in fact in its most extreme case it gets in the way of protecting his friends( Ichigo telling Orihime to heal Ulquiorra so he could fight him himself).
. This side of his character is almost always implicit which is why Kubo is such a talented writer.
Remember how Ulquiorra stopped his Getsuga tenshou with his bare hands? He got back at Ulquiorra by stopping Ulquiorra's spear at point blank range in Vasto Lorde form. He did the same thing against Aizen. Remember how Ichigo stopped Aizen's sword wit his hand and what he told him?
It's also why he didn't instantly kill Byakuya back in soul society arc. He wanted to get back at him for making fun of his small bankai and also for absolutely destroying him back in human world. If he just wanted to save Rukia he could have just killed Byakuya right there and then.
Another instance I can think of right now is his fight against Grimmjow. I think he was actually enjoying that fight so much that he held himself back just to drag the fight. And when Orihime yelled his name he kind of came back to his senses. It reminded him of why he was there so he stops Grimmjows claw and says "" sorry Grimmjow, I have to end this""."
Bleach,"That’s every anime lead though? They always wanna be strong, but even more so, they wanna do the right thing.

If anything having a main character prioritize being strong over doing the right thing - now that would be an actually special character."
Bleach,"so what your saying is he has an ""ideal"" not an ""ambition""."
Bleach,I can't think of many shonen that does this. It's a very bleach thing.
Bleach,">destined chosen one

He isn't destined or chosen one though nor was ever stated to be."
Bleach,Ichigo’s not a chosen one tho >!he was manufactured to be that way.  He’s more Frankenstein’s monster !<
Bleach,"He was somewhat overconfident in this arc too, but the Big Bad kicked his arse hard."
Bleach,"His combat abilities never peak. Dude is essentially limitless. Ichigo is the most ""Mary sue"" Mc I have ever seen.

This is how literally every story arc of bleach goes.

- ichigo meets bad guy. 
- ichigo fights said bad guys 
- ichigo wins some but eventually loses to strong bad guy
- ichigo becomes/inherits power of said bad guys. Usually as a special attack
- ichigo stomps

Rinse and repeat.

Oh and those fights? ""Getsuga tenshou"" for days as you said over and over.

Main reason I can't rewatch lol."
Bleach,The trope of the MC having room temp IQ except for when they are in fights where they are some fighting genius gets tiring. Not saying they aren't entertaining to watch. If they weren't I wouldn't watch those shows. But sometimes you get tired of seeing the different variations of Goku clones.
Bleach,"Cause, like most people, if I’m sitting down to watch a show I’m going to watch all the seasons of a show. I’m not just gonna go “eh, I’ll skip this season”"
Bleach,"considering wit took 10+ years to get to this season, I can wait another 7 months"
Bleach,"Honestly, just read the comic. For other shows that’s not as feasible, but Bleach is a breeze to read, not that text-dense at all and full of striking art that you can consume quickly. It will take a week to read the whole thing, and it is a well-drawn, well-paced Manga to binge."
Bleach,"A bit late but these videos are official recaps. They're 150 seconds each. It's region locked to US only though, so you might need a VPN.

Bleach,"u/hazychestnutz posted this in reply to another comment

Not really, of course it’s always best, but I haven’t watched any of the original either and just watched this recap video  on YouTube and I’m doing fine understanding it. 

https://youtu.be/1d0CQSMW3PA"
Bleach,"I was being more facetious. I rewatched the entire series over the past month or so before the new one and I did not expect to enjoy it as much as back then, but I totally did! My only complaint was the poor pacing at times which wasn't due to the story but more the production demanding certain episodes to be stretched to meet the quota."
Bleach,"Not exactly. Thousand Year Blood War is the last arc of the manga that was never adapted in the original anime (because manga wasn’t finished and the TV station chose to end the series instead of making yet another filler). TYBW picks up right where original anime ended, but it is also in many ways is also a new take on Bleach. 

The animation style has changed a lot, instead of hand drawn they are I think using mix of digital and hand drawn (to great effect I might add, the show has some of the best animated scenes in the entire series). The story is much darker and grimmer because the manga was too, but animation embraces it, it’s noticeably more graphic than the original series. The characters are bit older and there is (slightly) less immature humor. Though production studio still shows lot of respect to the old series, one way is by use of the old iconic soundtracks in key moments of the show. Overall it’s a much better paced and produced show that will feel perfect for old fans of the show who have grown up since the original series."
Bleach,"Right so the manga is complete?

I might read it"
Bleach,"Because the series is old and has hundreds of episodes, not all of them worth watching"
Bleach,It’s fan service as far as the anime goes? It seems like a pretty reasonable statement to make since we’re discussing the anime
Bleach,bruh are you just trying to trigger people by calling it a comic ?
Bleach,"From waiting 10 years, I'll take that damn filler right about now"
Bleach,[https://www.animefillerguide.com/2019/06/bleach-filler-list.html](https://www.animefillerguide.com/2019/06/bleach-filler-list.html)
Bleach,"Yeah. I just constantly Google “Bleach Fillers”. Lol. The first two hits give a really good breakdown of the fillers and one of them even ranks the filler arcs. 

I’m debating on whether or not I want to watch the fillers or just come back to them as some have suggested."
Bleach,The direct threat against him and his family is so obvious at times it works though
Bleach,"Generic shounen antagonist defeat cry: ""But I'm perfect! I'm the absolute of the absolute! How can this be possible?!""

Generic shounen protagonist response: ""Because you didn't love your friends/give up being antagonistic. I hope you become a better version of yourself one day.""

Generic shounen antagonist: ""Friends? Have I been wrong this whole time?""

Lather. Rinse. Repeat."
Bleach,"Full Hollow, not Vasto Lorde."
Bleach,"> He is petty and has a massive ego and it hurts when enemies stomp him.

I think being upset about being stomped is pretty universal across everyone. Most of the examples you've listed are more a sort of dramatic irony than the character actually turning to camera and shouting ""You see what I just did?"""
Bleach,That's just Goku mate.
Bleach,"If you want anime protagonists who aren’t heroic, maybe look into Evangelion, Chainsaw Man, or Fate Zero. They all subvert or dissect the hero archetype."
Bleach,"Naruto and One Piece both have some of this, with Naruto having a demon fox spirit and being the son of the Hokage (which makes his dream of being Hokage a lot less inspiring and charming) and Luffy seemingly related to the Dragon, the guy who hid the One Piece (I did stop reading OP a while ago, but that seemed to be what was being heavily implied then). 

Full metal Alchemist has a bit of this with Ed and Al being the son of Hohenheim, but that’s much better handled. 

My problem with Bleach is that Ichigo just has alllllll of it. Son of a noble family, son of a special genius Quincy, merged with an experimental hollow created by Aizen, potentially a son of the Soul King as well, a Fullbringer, a Vizard, and probably part demon by the time the Hell arc is halfway through. 

That’s irritating and takes away his agency. At a certain point, every other character becomes more interesting than him because they’re not destined to be the Hero ™ ."
Bleach,"He very much is. By multiple things, even. He was selected by Squad Zero to replace the Soul King should anything happen to him (which is interesting, I’ll give it that, but also means Ichigo is OP as all get out). He was engineered by Aizen and then closely watched and manipulated for his purposes (robbing Ichigo of agency, another least favourite trope of mine). He’s the last scion of Shiba, a cursed Noble family, who are supposed to have a destiny in saving the universe, blah blah blah. 

There’s so much."
Bleach,"That’s a variation on the chosen one. Plenty of others are that way as well. See Dune, Harry Potter, Anakin Skywalker, etc."
Bleach,The last arc was some pretty shit writing to be honest.
Bleach,That's how every shounen goes.
Bleach,"I never said naruto was some high iq genius but ok.

Op praised ichigo for not ""having rocks for brains"" unlike the other big three. which frankly idk where he got that idea from considering Ichigo doesn't really do anything but spam his ""special moves"" and bleaches fights don't really have any choreography to speak of(until recently) that would highlight any form of intelligence unlike say naruto where there is actually some of that lol"
Bleach,"That's a trope for a reason - explanation for the otherwise clueless reader. 

There has to be at least one dumb character to explain universe magic mechanics to so the reader can understand them. And it's just most convenient for it to be the main character because well, they're pretty much always around so when you introduce new variants or mechanics, someone has to have it explained."

The Borgias,"RIP

Vibert was Lepidus in Rome. Lepidus was part of the Second Triumvirate with Octavian and Marc Antony. Also was in the Hatfields and McCoys mini series."
The Borgias,"Very likeable in Rome, loathsome in the Borgias.  I guess that's the mark of a great actor."
The Borgias,"He died last Thursday at a Florida hospital after a brief illness. The nature of the illness was not specified. He leaves a wife, Jess."
The Borgias,"Haven't seen any of those, but he was great as Lord Wellington in the TV adaptation of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell."
The Borgias,He was excellent as Giovanni Sforza in *The Borgias*.
The Borgias,I can’t remember him in penny dreadful. I know that series well it’s one of my favorite! Who did he play on the show?
The Borgias,Penny Dreadful was so good.
The Borgias,Rome was such a great show
The Borgias,time to rewatch Rome
The Borgias,"This guy was an actor who made his often minor roles each into something to remember.  

He was a truly repellent Robespierre in the 90s *Scarlet Pimpernel* series with Richard E. Grant, Martin Shaw and Elizabeth McGovern, and later a nasty piece of work that kills the wife of Inspector Lewis in a hit-and-run in a show I can't recall the name of right now.  He was just really, really good... and IMO much better than many actors who are more well known.

Great actor who made the most of even mediocre parts.  R.I.P."
The Borgias,"I can't remember him from Rome but I do remember him as Perry Cline in Hatfields and McCoys. I didn't realise he was British but it makes sense, there were a few random Brits that showed up it Hs&Ms including Beppe Di Marco from Eastenders. It was filmed in Romania.

RIP."
The Borgias,"Damn, I wasn’t familiar with most of his work but I enjoyed him as Lepidus in Rome.  Died too young for sure."
The Borgias,I remember him from Rome and Hatfield & McCoys.  Really good actor.  Very sad.
The Borgias,"Wow, RIP"
The Borgias,"If Rome wasn’t cancelled prematurely, his role as Lepidus would have been remembered more."
The Borgias,Is he related to Luke Vibert?
The Borgias,I'm confusing him with David Thewlis.
The Borgias,"RIP, this guy was great in his roles."
The Borgias,"Vibert is a name I haven’t seen since my family started talking about genealogy and it was my grandmothers maiden name

The Borgias,He was such a good actor. R.I.P.
The Borgias,Thanks I was wondering who he was in *Rome*.
The Borgias,">	Vibert was Lepidus in Rome. 

Thank you."
The Borgias,That Hatfields and McCoys mini series was underrated
The Borgias,So loathsome in Borgias. I didn’t even remember him in Rome. Also Alienist and Carnival Row. I feel like Borgias was how I was exposed to him. What a shame.
The Borgias,"> after a brief illness. The nature of the illness was not specified.

Been way to many of these the last couple of years"
The Borgias,[removed]
The Borgias,fuck.  what a great adaptation of a great book.
The Borgias,"""I'm Strange."" ""Indeed."""
The Borgias,"I just finished his final episode on that series yesterday. He was a great character, because I hated him. Played the part perfectly."
The Borgias,"He was Sir Geoffrey, the lord out in the country who kills the cut wife"
The Borgias,I LOVED it. Such a shame it didn't have a high viewership and had to have that ending.
The Borgias,Agreed. Right up until they shit the bed with the ending.
The Borgias,"Season 1 is an absolute 10/10 for me

Season 2 is a good 7, but it drops the utterly beautiful yet mournful vibe the first season did so well. The Alienst had the same problem, the second season keeps the style, characters, and aesthetic, but softens the tone and the story just enough that it loses the vibe that made it something special

Both series even have share neuro divergent-coded protagonists that are genuinely shitty people in the first season, like next level toxic traits they struggle with but barely make some progress with, but the second season softens them out far beyond what makes sense for their prior characterization."
The Borgias,"It really was. Then they just kept repeating the same boring ""just out of reach"" storylines for a few more years. Overall, it was still an ""ok"" show on par with Santa Clara Diet and other very shallow shows."
The Borgias,"""How's your cousin, Lepidus?"""
The Borgias,"That show would have been called *Inspector Lewis*. Or just *Lewis*, depending on if you're in the UK or the US."
The Borgias,Ughhhh get a job
The Borgias,Yeah sure let’s use someone death and have some fun with it! So hilarious.
The Borgias,"Sorry, who is asking again?"
The Borgias,"The real Lepidus was just as forgettable, lol."
The Borgias,I thought he looked familiar but then I forgot Lepidus existed.
The Borgias,I used to watch it like once a year I enjoyed it so much. What a great miniseries
The Borgias,"In Rome, he was the General that Antony basically conscripted in to serving on his side (or face the sword)"
The Borgias,"He wasn't in a lot of episodes in Rome, I think 3 episodes in season 2, but all memorable scenes. He was really great as Lepidus. RIP."
The Borgias,"Hey, why don't we go back to 2016?
David Bowie, George Michael, Alan Thicke, Carrie Fisher, Alan Rickman, Chyna to name but a few..... a much more famous list of people who died too soon, many from heart complications.
I guess it must have been the vaxx. 
Administered by a time travelling assassin."
The Borgias,Somebody doesn’t like vaccines
The Borgias,The best some might say
The Borgias,So good! I have some quibbles about the ending and how they used Stephen Black but otherwise- so fantastic.
The Borgias,"Yes! Loved the novel and wondered if the adaptation would be up to it. It very much was. His Lord Wellington was great, equal parts brilliant and insufferably arrogant. But he got the straight roads he wanted :D"
The Borgias,Ohhhh ok!  Totally remember now! Thanks 🥰
The Borgias,I’m still not over it. I was so excited when they did another show but it fizzled fast.
The Borgias,"Yes, there should have been more seasons. I remember the ending was abrupt."
The Borgias,"Agree, plus I couldn’t stand Rory Kinnear with the sad monster act. So tiring"
The Borgias,What an amazing coincidence!
The Borgias,"He could've been struck by lightning, ""It was probably caused by the vaccine!"""
The Borgias,I take it you’ve never laughed at a 9/11 joke then huh.
The Borgias,Who is this person again?
The Borgias,The real Lepidus got to peacefully retire in a time when defeated political rivals typically ended up dead. He got off luckier than most.
The Borgias,"The real Lepidus wasn’t that pathetic and in the end lived a long life. Before Octavian he was Caesars most capable Legate and took over after Antony messed up in Italy, proving to be a great administrator. It’s just his role in the civil war had a flaccid start and his own men betrayed him. Similar thing with Antony in the grand scheme of things but he had been in power for longer."
The Borgias,Ouch classics burn
The Borgias,I love how often he shows up in Historia Civilis youtube channel and how things always go wrong for him.
The Borgias,"I mean, he made it all the way up to today, technically."
The Borgias,[removed]
The Borgias,"Vaccinated people can still die from covid. They are far less likely to die compared to the un-vaccinated, but the fact that he died (if it was from covid) doesn't necessarily mean he was anti-vax."
The Borgias,He never said vaccine
The Borgias,"Abrupt, but also pretty unfulfilling. The entire arc of the whole show up to that point was just tossed out, and everything just ""ended"" with a big ""F U"" to the viewers. It was the first TV show that ended in such a way that I had been a fan of. It was rough."
The Borgias,The 9/11 joke werent a thing when the event just happened.
The Borgias,[removed]
The Borgias,"Not Ronan, the guy I responded to."
The Borgias,This isn't true
The Borgias,Subreddits he's posted in confirms he's an antivax loon.
The Borgias,"He didn't have to.

The anti-vax morons (and indeed most conservatives) love to start shit by ""just asking questions"" that have already been answered but with answers which their audience doesn't know or by asking questions which cannot be reliably answered. They do this to give dumbasses the opportunity to try and answer themselves, usually with wrong answers, or they provide their own equally wrong answer in the next round of responses, all with the goal of diverting people away from the truth because they're trying to garner support for their (again, dumb as shit) ideas."
The Borgias,"He's a conservative, so it's an easy bet."
The Borgias,That’s how afraid of them he is
The Borgias,"I remember watching it live and that title card at the end came up. I was like ""What??"""
The Borgias,"Such a shame, first 2 seasons were incredible"
The Borgias,I didn't catch the last few episodes but was the entire plotline with Dorian and the FrankenBride just dropped?
The Borgias,[removed]
The Borgias,Imagine having that username and still not understanding or liking science. Shameful.
The Borgias,Aren’t there clean walls somewhere for you to go smear shit on?
The Borgias,Also it’s obvious to anyone with a brain what he was saying. You barely have to read between the lines lol
The Borgias,"It doesn't help that I've been seeing an increasing number of headlines like ""Woman dies suddenly at 32"" and then when you read the article it turns out she had a birth defect or cancer or something.

And the people who write those articles know the anti-vax loons won't read past the headline.

Like, the media is baiting these people and whipping them up into a frenzy by confirming their nutcase biases."

The Borgias,"First some context. The story of the Borgias still fascinates because it was the last great story from medieval Europe. Because so much was destroyed following the death of Rodrigo and the publishing of ""The Prince"" their story became the stuff of legends. 

Lucretia Borgia was likely to have been the most desirable noble-woman of the entire 15th century. Her hold over the imaginations of nearly every man she met led to much of the discord not only between men but entire families. Rodrigo was the culmination of 2 centuries of social climbing within Italy by the Borgia family. While the Italy of the late medieval period was tearing itself apart the Borgias consolidated their family power. 

The series ""The Borgias"" is an historical adaption much the way ""Rome"" was. They played very loose with history and made no attempt to find actors who resembled their real-life counterparts. The only characters that resembled real life were Giulia Farnese and King Charles.

The series ""Borgia"" is faithful to history in the sequence of events and the events themselves. Much is of course recreated owing to the destruction of records and images. However, what details survive is portrayed vividly while what was re-created is plausible. Most of the actors resemble their real-life counterparts with the exceptions of Rodrigo and Giulia. 

All in all I would say that ""Borgia"" is what you'd like if you prefer history while ""The Borgias"" would satisfy those who prefer story-telling."
The Borgias,"The Borgias is superior imo, the main cast has much more Charisma, to the point you can actually believe people would follow them. 

I feel the Borgia had a lot of gratuitous sexual violence too."
The Borgias,Borgia got annoying quickly in how Cesare busts in at the 11th hour of every crisis with a genius solution that solves every problem.
The Borgias,"Spoiler alert. 

I'm watching The Borgias right now and have a few episodes of Season 3 left to watch. I love the spiderwebbed politics aspect of the show but I don't like the incestuous angle that felt like a premonition from the first episode. They could have done without it since there were so many other aspects to explore - Juan's pregnant wife, Guilia's brother, the arc of Alfonso's character etc.  

Might watch Borgia after for comparison purposes!"
The Borgias,Really perfered borgia. Really didnt like The Borgias juan
The Borgias,"I don't remember which is which since they both basically came out at the same time, but the Jeremy Irons one was pretty bad. He was the only good thing about it, the Cesare actor had all the charisma of a piece of lint.

The other one was actually pretty good, but Doman's American accent was pretty jarring amongst all the other more similar sounding Euro accents. Cesare in this one was much more believable."
The Borgias,Borgia is so much better. The Borgias should not have been made
The Borgias,"I saw the one with Jeremy Irons, and was supremely disappointed they went with the incest angle which is near universally accepted as propagandist bullshit. I also didn't think Irons really fit the role as a pope very well but I don't know why exactly.  

I'm going to watch the other one eventually and hope it doesn't fall into the same trap."

Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Netflix documentaries tend to always be edited in heavily manipulated way, but in this case seems like he ruined his own life for other reasons."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Not being smart enough to realize that willingly highlighting his crimes on a Netflix documentary ruined his life.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Joe Exotic is pretty shitty but that other cult leader guy in one of the Carolinas actually seems a lot worse.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,I dare say that he is never going to financially recover from this
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"One day you are living the dream. Drugging young straight men and having gay sex with them, killing tigers whenever. Then it all gets messy."

Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Any business that relies on petting tiger cubs is going to result in abuse. It takes a lot of cubs per year to maintain that business, and they live for 20 years in captivity. 

Think about that, you probably get just a 8-10 weeks out of each Cub for people to pet them, but they live for 20 years. Having 10-15 adult tigers are needed in the zoo, but what happens to all of the other tigers? They would either need to all be sold off, but if that doesn’t happen you end up killing them or having so many they can’t be properly cared for.

That’s why any business that is about petting Tiger cubs is going to end up abusing the tigers in the end."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Fucking good, he's a piece of shit who murdered tigers and put others through insanely bad conditions. 

The amount of outright misogyny that came out of that show and people for some reason harping on Carol when she literally was just trying to help the tigers and thinking the Joe was cool even though he was literally shooting tigers... I can't."

Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Pretty sure being a giant piece of shit ruined your life bud.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Nah I think being a general piece of shit ruined your life dude…
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,I would argue that it was he who ruined his life
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,He ruined his life. Don’t hire someone to kill someone else. That’s pretty easy not to do.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Pretty sure running what was essentially a tiger mill and planning an actual murder is what ruined his life.

Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Man tries to become famous.  Finds out being famous is not all its cracked up to be.  Whines about it.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Because his life was peachy prior to the show?
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,I'm shocked ..... SHOCKED ..... to learn that Joe Exotic does not take personal responsibility for his failings.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"He ruined his life before, during and after filming Tiger King.

He chose to put his shit out there now he’s famous like he’s always wanted along with those other hot mess of a cast."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,No I think it was all the fuckin terrible shit you did Joe.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Pretty sure that being an enormous shitbird ruined his life, but sure, blame the internet."

Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Joe ruined joes life.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Last Podcast on the Left talked about his crimes well before Tiger King was probably even pitched to Netflix
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"I've watched that damn documentary about 10 times now, and it's just as entertaining as the first. Joe, you may hate it, but I fucking love it, you ole' gay ass cowboy."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Animal abuse, illegal activities, meth, murder plot for hire, employee/lover accidently shoots himself in the head, employee's arm ripped off etc etc etc."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Says the guy who was in jail since before the show… but go off sis

Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Dude doesn’t realize without the very thing he’s being interviewed for, he’s just be a nameless gay man dying of cancer sitting in prison. He ruined his own life, Netflix made a documentary about it."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"That kid accidentally shooting himself and the face and the reaction of that intern (or whatever his role was) who was in the room was one of the craziest things I've seen in media, and that's saying something seeing as how I watched all of Tiger King."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"If you ever feel low in life, just watch an episode of Tiger King. You'll feel better about your situation in about 30 seconds lmao"
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Almost like youre a criminal that brought too much attention to yourself. Go to Hell groomer
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"his “music career” was the most preposterous shit of all time lmao

that’s what I think about most from that show for whatever reason"
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Similar to that Chrisly knows best guy. 

If you’re doing illegal shit, don’t agree to publicly air everything while recording. Duh."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Gosh that doc was a masterpiece. Came out at the perfect time for it. During a time when everyone was in lockdown and no one knew what the fuck was gonna happen in the world and this came out and gave everyone a laugh.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Really? It’s the show that ruined his life?
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,It was going REALLY well before that ...
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,He ruined his own life
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Lol he fucked around and found out
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Oh no...

Anyway.

🙄🎻"
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"I watched the series and I still don’t get why the internet was so gaga for Tiger King. What I saw was a bunch of animal abusers just abusing animals. Shocking, interesting in a way, but it got old pretty quick."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Maybe the meth and planning a murder had a bigger role to play.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Blames the documentary (about everything he did to himself) for ruining his life lol. This is literally the most Joe Exotic thing ever lol.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Seems like he did it all by himself
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Bruh, you been high af on God knows what and rockin that r/justfuckmyshitup look for *how* long?? You’re right though, I’m sure it was the Netflix thing that ruined it all"

Use meth? Jail. 

Hire a hit man to kill your competitor? Believe it or not… straight to jail."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"He ruined his life, they just filmed it"
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"The show didn’t cause your problems Joe, it exposed them."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,You mean it exposed all the illegal shit you were doing?
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Hiring an assassin might have that result
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Maybe don’t court attention when you are involved in illegal and disreputable activities
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,That and all the crimes.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Tiger king filmed him ruining his life.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,I mean wasn't that the purpose? To expose this whole debacle?
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Joe Exotic taking responsibility for his actions challenge (Impossible)
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"His life was ruined already, Tiger king exposed it"
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"Ladies and gentleman, if you like pizza, pasta, or chicken Alfredo, I can promise you - Zooters is the place you want to stop."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,It's like that meme of the guy on the bike putting the stick in his own spokes and then blaming a TV Show but he's in jail because he's a giant piece of shit.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Now that people know all the things I've done my life is ruined.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"What is, “things I do not care about?” Alex"
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,But not the attempted murder.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Idiot. Obviously
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,He'll never financially recover.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Pretty sure being a piece of shit ruined his life long before Tiger King premiered
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Michael Keaton should 100% play him  in a biopic.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,R/tigersatemyface?
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,His actions ruined his life.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,False: he ruined his own life; Tiger King just showed the rest of us how much he fucked it up
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Joe ruined his own life but refuses to face reality.
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,"If someone wants to make a documentary about you, you're either doing great or terrible things. The good thing is most doc subjects are narcissistic enough to believe they're always the former and let the cameras in."
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,Joe ruined his own life long before the show came out
Barbie Life in the Dreamhouse,I think Joe Exotic ruined Joe Exotic's life.

"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea",True blood is over? Huh. TIL.
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","In my opinion, this is unlikely to be the last season. They've done stuff like this before. Bare with me, for this is all just from memory, but let me tell you a few things they've done. 


It the very beginning of the show, they were going to be detectives. Dr weird, the insane doctor from the beginnings of the early episodes, was their arch nemisis. They ended up doing jack shit about their first case, actually making things worse. By the second episode, they ignored the fact they were supposed to be detectives at all.


Quite a few seasons later, after living in the same house and nothing changing the whole show, there was a big deal about them moving from there house. They weren't gonna live there, and Carl was finally gonna get rid of them. They moved two houses down on the other side of Carl. By the end of the episode they'd blown up the house and moved back home.

There was also a big deal about the hundredth episode (I'm not even sure it was the hundredth episode) wherin they thought they were gonna get cancelled and get chased around by a manifestation of 100. And shake is the only one who knows they've been on a show this whole time and was making money off it. In the end, he flys out to California with a tape of the show, taking off his shake costume to reveal the voice actor, to plead with the execs not to cancel the show. They're not impressed, and cancel it. The show continues as normal next episode. 

And finally, the big one. Aqua teen hunger force will no longer be aqua teen hunger force. They will now be Aqua Unit Patrol Squad, they're gonna be detectives again, and are moving to Seattle. They even change the famous intro and theme music. Adult swim makes a huge deal out of it. And of course, in the first (2 part?) episode everything is different, they're house in Seattle is the same house only its raining, and if I remember correctly they end up destroying the world. The show goes back to normal. (Mostly. The show does end up taking a slightly different flavor, although is hard to put your finger on.) 


Since then, with every new season of the show they've changed the name, as well as the intro and theme music. First with Aqua TV Show Show (which has an amazing theme by flying lotus) and then, finally, Aqua You Know, Whatever. 


So forgive me for not believing them. But when its not really the end, I'll find it fucking hilarious. 

Edit: and that doesn't even go into the movie. They made a big deal about going into their origins, and then had some ridiculous over serious origin story which ended up keep having twists and then I believe all being fake anyway. My favorite thing they did was they made a game promoting the movie, which was nominally and platformed, but ended up being nothing but moving left in a empty level. They teased that if you beat it there was a sneak peak of the movie, so I played the whole thing. You couldn't just put something on the key and leave it either, because the was like one pit which makes you start over and who knew if there was more. Sat there for like a half hour, finally got to the end. The clip? A clip of the credits rolling."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","A lot of the shows you mentioned weren't canceled, like Breaking Bad."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea",What if the show can get picked up by another company?
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","Youse guys ran out of peyote and weed to inhabit the state in which you write the show.

Don't lie. It's ugly."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","Holy shit, this show is still on?! "
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","I still remember seeing the ATHF movie in theaters.

There where 3 people in that theater that held 150. Me, my brother, and our friend. I can't say I've ever laughed as hard as I did at the mastodon intro. Mostly because we all ignored it, until I heard them mention not pulling your penis out.

Shit was gold."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","Holy fucking shit, ATHF is still on the air ? I was positive that show was done for years ago.

 I've been missing out all this time, and now it's too late. Hope it comes to Netflix soon."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","Why the hell should we care about some shitty two-bit show that shouldn't even exist, because of how low-class it is?"

"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea",You are truly a Moon Master.
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","I don't think it looks easy at all, ATHF can be extremely clever sometimes. Not so much through narrative because it's only an eleven minute show with stories that never really go anywhere, but some of the dialogue is just genius. So many of Shake's comments have left me struggling to breathe."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea",That's a very good analysis.

Simpsons, family guy, you name it they all got worse. But this show was special. They didn't have to pander for viewers, try too hard, or write anything that made any sense at all. And it worked for 15 years. They're goddamn american heroes."
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea","I would say it's a little less simple and the plots are a little more contrived, but basically, yes"
"Yo Soy Betty, La Fea",I only watched the first 2 seasons because they were on Netflix and they were gold. I really hope the other seasons are just as good.

I will give it a shot because why not, but that being said how good this show is will be directly proportional to how many people get thrown into a [volcano] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0le_cjUwO8)."
Bloodline,"I just want to see Jin and Heiheichi wave dashing at each other, that's really all I ask."
Bloodline,3D looks cheaper than a five dollar hooker
Bloodline,God I wanted Tekken to cross over with Netflix's Bloodline IP so badly.  Imagine the Rayburn family helping Kazuya face off against Heihachi and Danny.
Bloodline,"I just don't understand the appeal of these CGI fighting animes Netflix puts out. Moving a computer animated model around is just so much less impressive than hand drawing a fight, especially when the IP being adapted already has a playable fighting game alternative. 

As a kid I used to watch the characters perform their katas on the Tekken 3 arcade machine's attract mode. Back then it was super impressive, but that was like two decades ago. I certainly wouldn't have the patience for a whole TV series of them, let alone all the talking between the fights. The Tekken story is goofy fun but it isn't why people come back to the series. So who is this for? 

Who's gonna come to Tekken because they liked the Netflix anime adaptation? Or vice versa? It's depressing that so many talented animators are wasting their energy on a show thats only goal seems to be raising brand awareness of an already pretty popular fighting game.

Edit: Apparently, it's for more people than I thought."
Bloodline,This looks much better than the previous trailer. Although it's best to keep expectations since this might be a hit or miss.
Bloodline,Always loved the bits (and I mean bits) of story they added to the Tekken games.  Going to see if I can get a character list.
Bloodline,But why in gods name would they do that??! That is so stupid.
Bloodline,Takes me back. It was always my favorite Tekken growing up.
Bloodline,I think that's intentional so that they could 3D animate the moves to like like they do in the games...also they probably don't have Arcane's budget.
Bloodline,"Well, the trailer shows King, but no VA has been announced for him in the Japanese dub. (I’ve not seen an English casting yet, but as I have seen the trailer with English audio we will have an English dub). There is still hope for Yoshimitzu to still appear. I doubt the King will go the whole time w/o speaking."
Bloodline,"No Martial or Forrest Law either.

Hard Pass.

Not to mention it looks like the whole movie takes place in this one location. That's like the most boring thing they could do..."
Bloodline,"No Mokujin, no Jack, no Roger, or Alex, not even a Kuma.

There's so much missing."
Bloodline,"I was expecting Heihachi to have a deep and intimidating voice like his game counterpart...in this he sounds too much like David Lo Pan from Big Trouble or the Shang Tsung that appears in the MK animated movies and older games. Almost a stereotypical ""evil Asian sorcerer"" type of role, which really doesn't fit Heihachi at all."
Bloodline,"I agree with you on the CGI anime thing. Always looks bad imo. Disagree on the other stuff. I’d definitely watch a Tekken anime, but not this one."
Bloodline,Appears to be an art style choice. Someone thought that having a massive shadow made up of straight lines constantly on your characters made the show look better than without I guess.
Bloodline,Tekken Tag Tournament wants to know your location
Bloodline,">also they probably don't have Arcane's budget.

This is the more plausible reason for the meh animation I'm seeing right now from the trailer. It's not like all the moves from the game can't be done in even 2D animation if it was handled by good anime studio, it's just Netflix picking whichever cheapest studio they could find so it's less of a risk investment since the anime has Tekken brand on it to get the fans to watch.

The animation is adequate, not awful like Berserk 2016, but I wouldn't call it good, either. The movement reminds me of early PS2 anime game cutscene with some stilted character models and robotic movement."
Bloodline,"> also they probably don't have Arcane's budget.

They definitely don't. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure Riot bankrolls Arcane entirely, Netflix is just who they partnered with as a release platform. This seems to be more of a Netflix original."
Bloodline,"> also they probably don't have Arcane's budget.

Time* not budget. Arcane has a relatively small budget actually. Fortiche was given years to finish it though."
Bloodline,How do y’all make do with being so pessimistic? Sounds exhausting
Bloodline,*Marshall and Forest
Bloodline,"It's quite clear that the show will be about the Mishima family and more specifically, Jin's story in Tekken 3. Marshal Law wasn't in Tekken 3, and Forest Law's story doesn't intersect with Jin's."
Bloodline,"I mean, aren't there something like 60 characters in the games?  If every character made an appearance, they'd each get like 1 minute of screen time.  LOL!"
Bloodline,"Yeah he is an old man who has spent his life kicking and getting kicked in the throat, yelling at board members and inhaling large amounts of ash from an volcano. 

The voice does not fit *at all*."
Bloodline,[deleted]
Bloodline,"Jack, Kuma and Mokujin were all in the first game, Jin wasn't even in that."
Bloodline,"If you look up on the Tekken Bloodline wiki, in the trivia section it said a Japanese company named Barnstorm Design Labo appears to be working on the project. So it’s still very likely a Japanese Anime production."
Bloodline,Bloodline was one of those shows that had a one season premise and worked excellently but couldn't figure out how to prolong it after success. there are so many shows like that.
Bloodline,First season is one of my all time favorites. Didn't like second season and third as you said is awful.
Bloodline,"S1 was fantastic, S2 was good but suffered without Danny being around most of the time. They learned S3 was their last season and had to cram so much in it became a jumbled mess."
Bloodline,"They lost their Florida tax credit and had to end it fast.  Ben Mendelsohn signed to do Star Wars and wasn't available for most of Season 2 or 3.  Kyle Chandler had to carry the load without anyone on his level to work off of.    He was literally acting with himself in scenes.

In another note, where they filmed it on the Keys got flooded in a hurricane and it would have  ended anyway."
Bloodline,[deleted]
Bloodline,"And if the first and second seasons weren't boring as shit. I swear to god that show was twice as long as it needed to be. 

I swear how many times did we hear Kyle Chandler cryptically say, we are not bad people but we did a bad thing."
Bloodline,I watched season 1 and it was completely awful. I feel like a lot of people who post new threads in this sub hyping up random ass shows need to watch better TV shows and get a more accurate frame of reference to what makes a show great.
Bloodline,"I loved this show.Yeah,the wheels started to come off in S2 but I still enjoyed it.But, Holy Sh*t. S3 second to last episode is the worse episode of tv I’ve seen, what a waste of an hour.Thats what you do for your second to last episode ever,it was all a dream crap.

Edit: I did like how the brother was arrested,because he left his cellphone on and they tracked it was very on character for him."
Bloodline,"I recall the writers saying they had a 5 season plan for the show.  Apparently, that's part of the reason the final season was a jumbled mess.  Rather than doing much adjusting when Netflix gave them a final season, they seemingly just tried to cram as much as they could into the final 10 episodes."
Bloodline,"Absolutely agree. Ben Mendelsohn is one of my favorite actors working. So was definitely a bummer. Same issue I had with Boardwalk Empire. If anyone has seen it, they know what I mean lol. 


I still enjoyed season 2 though. But looks like I'm in the minority judging from these comments. Didn't realize season 2 was frowned upon as well. Season 3 stunk though."
Bloodline,"Okay what do you consider to be great television?

Bc whatever shows you mention, I bet I've seen them. I've seen a bunch of great TV shows. But my favorite shows are The Sopranos, Deadwood, Mad Men, Rome, Six Feet Under and The Leftovers. I'd probably put Justified and and Mr Inbetween up there as well. 

I've seen a lot of great shows. So your ""frame of reference"" statement doesn't make sense. Unless you don't consider any of those shows I mentioned to be great. 

And I thought Bloodline season 1 was some of the best television you can watch. So my point is.. it's all subjective. Don't need a pencil and paper to compare TV shows so I can figure out if one is good or not."
Bloodline,"> I watched season 1 and it was completely awful.

It absolutely was."
Bloodline,"To anyone who hasn’t played TLoU2, just leave any TLoU thread. Too many people hint at stuff that’ll happen in the future in these threads."
Bloodline,"So in the game I totally understood Joel’s POV. 

I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Not the killing part but the moral quandary was not one for me.

The lying though was a mistake.

In the show it was more disturbing because they really portrayed him as a mass shooter."
Bloodline,"I like this statement:

>Good stories are not built on themes like “brotherhood” or “anger”; those are just words. Good stories are built on arguments: It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that."
Bloodline,Well Neil Druckmann did first when he wrote the game. Craig is just echoing that here.
Bloodline,This guy was such a moron in the after the episode specials. Can’t listen to him at all.
Bloodline,These guys think they are way smarter than they are.
Bloodline,[removed]
Bloodline,This is why I love the characters so much...they are layered. No one is the good guy or bad guy; everyone has reasons for doing what they're doing. Nuance makes for a great show!
Bloodline,Omg it’s a tv show not a moral compass. My god can we not have anything?!
Bloodline,Gonna be so thankful i got a teenage girl brain slurry vaccine when cannibal rapists chop off my legs or a bloater rips out my spine
Bloodline,"Empathy is a double edged sword too. 

You can just as much empathize with a hobo as you can with a Nazi. 

We need to understand we are not infallible.  That our emotions are not truths. That our instincts are tools, not laws. That dogs trusting these same feelings can see children as threats and attack them. We are no different. 

But what we do after acknowledging...how we ACT on these principles is something neither Neil nor Mazen has yet to interrogate 

I'd like to see less critique and more attempts at solutions that promote dialogue."
Bloodline,"That's a cool concept and all, but I'm not sure this is the right scenario to explore it because I don't think it feels nearly as grey as that would require. Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here, or consider them ""negative"" expressions of love in any meaningful way."
Bloodline,Joel entering the Avatar State to save Ellie.
Bloodline,Thanks for the heads up
Bloodline,"As someone who hasn't played the game, all of these discussion threads are so frustrating. Everyone constantly talking about what happened in the game. I don't care about the game, I'm just trying to enjoy the TV show."
Bloodline,"I have played neither game and am watching this series and loving it so far. Thank you for the heads up, even though so much time has passed. Appreciate it"
Bloodline,Bless you
Bloodline,I basically told all of my family and friends to *not* read any article or community regarding it because people are so toxic about it in general if they wanted to keep fresh eyes and not be spoilt.
Bloodline,"Or you know, don’t frequent threads that might spoil things for you in the first place?

The games vs the show have very different fan bases. The show moves faster than the game. You don’t want spoilers?

Don’t watch the show until you’ve played the game. It’s that simple. 

Spoiler avoidance from game to show? Two completely different ball games. Do not make demands that can not be met."
Bloodline,"The HBO specific sub really needs to enforce a ""No Game Talk"" rule or have ""Show Only"" threads"
Bloodline,It wouldn't be a problem if they'd fucking release it for PC
Bloodline,"I still understand his PoV. They were going to kill his daughter again. I also understand that it's not the morally ""right"" thing to do, and it's also very selfish. But a lot of parents would go for the selfish option without even thinking of the impact it'd leave on their child.

Ellie now has the corpses of the potential saviors of humanity on her name. All while believing her immunity can't be for nothing. That's rough."
Bloodline,"Ironic given that you kill A LOT more people in the game (because it's a fame, I understand thebseparation of media, just funny that it felt that way)"
Bloodline,"> So I’m the game I totally understood Joel’s POV.
> 
> I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Yeah, first time I played the game... there wasn't a thought of sneak through the hospital. Like Joel, I killed everyone that was in the way."
Bloodline,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
Bloodline,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you’re controlling him you empathize. When he’s autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."
Bloodline,My friend said that it gave off school shooter vibes
Bloodline,"I mean, I don't know – I'm not sure Tolkien would agree.

Heck, larger themes like ""loyalty"" and ""brotherhood"", etc. were a huge part of the driving forces in LoTR."
Bloodline,"> It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that.

I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad"""
Bloodline,"This is what bothers me about tlou2 talk. It's fucking shallow as shit. People talk about it like it's exploring some deep theme. It's not. It's the basic premise of anylove story really. What would you do for love? What's interesting is not that ""from a different perspective, things are different!"" That's fucking basic. What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."
Bloodline,I think this is just putting to bed the cope a lot of fans are feeling over certain scenes potentially being changed.
Bloodline,Co-wrote*
Bloodline,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
Bloodline,[removed]
Bloodline,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
Bloodline,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
Bloodline,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."
Bloodline,[Big ol' spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-nQUiD6_g&t=333s&ab_channel=Wisecrack)
Bloodline,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
Bloodline,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
Bloodline,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
Bloodline,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
Bloodline,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
Bloodline,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
Bloodline,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
Bloodline,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
Bloodline,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."
Bloodline,What?
Bloodline,They do though? There’s not many show only threads but they are there.
Bloodline,...they do have show only threads
Bloodline,Rekt
Bloodline,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
Bloodline,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
Bloodline,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
Bloodline,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I'd never really thought about this before but I genuinely love this kind of well thought out deep dive into something I'd never even thought to consider.

That's a really interesting point about the unique effect of using actual music in early seasons."
SpongeBob SquarePants,Just another reason why seasons 1-3 are the GOAT
SpongeBob SquarePants,Early Spongebob has that nice MTV feel. Before MTV collapsed into reality.
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Nice analysis and I never really thought about it like that. I wonder if the pivot away was due to royalties payments to the songwriters. After the movie, SpongeBob was huge and I’m sure people wanted their cut of the money."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"One of the reasons I stopped watching SpongeBob was sound-related, albeit it was more the fact that Tom Kenny changed the main character's voice slightly. It just sounded off compared to what he sounded like in the first three seasons and movie."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"If anyone ever remakes American Psycho, I nominate this to replace the Huey Lewis monologue."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Please, OP / someone, make a video about this! I’ve seen a few Sponge Bob episodes, but years ago, and never really connected which was from which season. But this take is fascinating and I would love to hear it narrated over examples / clips from the show. I would gladly sit through commercials on YouTube for this!"
SpongeBob SquarePants,I think we found one of the members of the surf dusters
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Speak for yourself, it was the reason I was asked to leave the table at thanksgiving."
SpongeBob SquarePants,Never watched the show but kinda fascinated at this detail. Now I want to check out the first few seasons for the music.
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Nice write up! I wish there were channels like defunctland that did a deep dive into these nick shows, the histories, and some of the technical stuff that make them work."
SpongeBob SquarePants,Yea I think Rugrats and blue's clues also suffered from less focus on sound design as they went on. Perhaps we can petition some universities to do some studies on why this occured. Perplexing to say the least
SpongeBob SquarePants,"The Art of SpongeBob twitter account mentioned this a few months ago. Licensing issues caused Nickelodeon to no longer have the rights to most of the sound library they were using in the first three seasons. So they must have decided to put more emphasis on original music so they can ensure that they don't lose the rights to them.

[https://twitter.com/artofspongebob/status/1537251452615282688](https://twitter.com/artofspongebob/status/1537251452615282688)

That being said, it is easy to fall into the trap of making the music coincide to what's happening in the episode when making original music. Rather than looking through a library of pre-recorded material and choosing which fits best. No style is better than the other, but it's a different feel and I agree, I do prefer how they did it in the earlier seasons."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"A very good analysis and I think you’re. As time goes on it got bigger and their budget grew so they used it.

You see it with a lot of shows but it moves past the charm of what made it iconic in the first place"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"A wise man once said ""The importance of details is you don't really notice it unless it's not there"""
SpongeBob SquarePants,"
I can see how the early season music may have had a kind of “scuffed” charm. Great post."
SpongeBob SquarePants,So that's why I can't sit through it anymore.
SpongeBob SquarePants,wait... why did you watch this amount of SpongeBob?
SpongeBob SquarePants,"TL 

DR"
SpongeBob SquarePants,This is interesting. Do you have any video comparisons? It's hard for me to fully understand without actually seeing it
SpongeBob SquarePants,That moment when you realize your musical taste was subcounsciously shaped by Sponge Bob.
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I know what you mean, it has that ""show that snuck on to kids television that maybe shouldn't be there"" feel."
SpongeBob SquarePants,I don't think that's how stock music works. They use stock music because it is cheaper than hiring composers and the like.
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Gene Roddenberry infamously wrote lyrics to Star Trek's opening theme song so that he would get a cut of the royalties every time the song was played, despite the song being used only as an instrumental, there were never any plans for lyrics other then the narration.  

It wouldn't surprise me if someone realized they'd get more money if it was their own music instead of stock music.  Not Nickelodeon, but a producer or something."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"A lot of the voices changed after the movie, pretty much everyone except maybe squidward just sound really off by the time you get to season 7 but now you can physically hear the voice actors aging. Simpsons is having a similar problem right now"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I have that issue too. I know that he has talked about it, and I think it’s because as he gets older it’s harder for him to do the original voice? Something like that. So it makes sense! But I still don’t like it as much"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I actually do make videos, so I’ll look into this! I feel like I’d need to do a little more research on it for accuracy, but I think it’d be fun and clearly a few people want something like this haha (myself included, I wish there was more analyzed information on this out there)"
SpongeBob SquarePants,You’re laughing. He comes out here and makes a heartfelt plea about SpongeBob and you’re laughing at him.
SpongeBob SquarePants,More popular the show is the more they have to pay in royalties so the less they’d want to play music where they would need to
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I didn’t don’t worry lol, the wiki has a list of production music used for every episode and I’ve just been researching it. I did recently watch the first 3 seasons and movie, and concurrently watched season 4 with a friend for his video on how that season killed the show, but I haven’t been able to stomach anything past that since childhood."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I don’t on hand, but if you go to the SpongeBob wiki every episode has a list of the production music used, most with links to their own page that have a video example and information on what episodes used it. If you just check out a random old episode and a random new one you’ll pick up on the difference pretty quickly. I did make a playlist recently for YouTube containing 20 songs that were mostly or completely abandoned after the movie if you want a place to start https://youtu.be/DxdBaVTULjk"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"*Happy Tree Friends* is that show for me. MTV used to air it here at 8:00 a.m., acting like it's a children's show. I was shocked to see one of the characters melting someone's face off using a pan, poking their eye socket and putting their eyes in a blender. Jesus. I never watched it again."
SpongeBob SquarePants,Stock music isn’t the same as royalty free music. Stock music or library music still receives royalties from the companies that use them.
SpongeBob SquarePants,It's hard to hear Marge in the latest Simpsons season.
SpongeBob SquarePants,One thing to note that the term “sound design” does not refer to music. It refers to the sound effects.
SpongeBob SquarePants,A video or even some links to song clips would be so interesting
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I know.  How about another joke, Sandy?"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"damn, I just guess I watched the first seasons in my youth and stopped around the premier of the movie."
SpongeBob SquarePants,Thanks! I'll check it out
SpongeBob SquarePants,It depends on the licensing agreement for each specific piece of music.
SpongeBob SquarePants,Yeah it’s bad. I hadn’t watched any new Simpsons in a few years but decided to watch this current season and was immediately put off by how bad she sounds
SpongeBob SquarePants,"If it’s part of a library like UPM or Warner Chapel, the license is covered by the library license the company signs with those libraries."
SpongeBob SquarePants,[deleted]
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I think the show will find different voices for minor characters up until they have to deal with the loss of a proper Simpson. Like they replaced Hibbert recently, and that's going fine enough."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"It's not a rip off. There's some inspiration in the art style, but they are very different shows."
SpongeBob SquarePants,I mean is it a rip off if they’re both from the same network
SpongeBob SquarePants,Pretty sure after the Stephen Hillenburg and co. exodus after the 2004 movie a bunch of Ren and Stimpy veterans were brought on to fill the void. Probably the reason you're looking for.
SpongeBob SquarePants,No because Ren&Stimpy was funny
SpongeBob SquarePants,and had some of the same people working on it like [Vincent Waller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Waller)
SpongeBob SquarePants,I’m not really looking for a specific answer…more just wondering if this is accepted fact or not. I embarrassingly just saw S&S for the first time and was kinda shocked at the similarities. R&S was on when I was a kid and I loved it.

SpongeBob SquarePants,"The thing that makes Spongebob so special to me is that I can say a line of dialogue from any of the old episodes and almost everyone I know can say the line that came next, even though we haven't watched the episode in over 10 years. That's how memorable and impactful it was on our lives. "
SpongeBob SquarePants,We should take ALS and put it somewhere else.
SpongeBob SquarePants,"This is terrible, he is responsible for creating a show that I consider a huge formative part of my childhood and I know so many other people in my generation feel the same way

I know there isn't much you can do in a situation like this, but I wish him the best "
SpongeBob SquarePants,"One of my personal favorite moments in the show. 

https://youtu.be/1Ck0su859Ps"
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Damn. That is a kick in my ""ripped""'pants. 

Squidward's ""future"" freak out is perhaps the best 5 seconds of TV. 

Such a funny, well written show. "
SpongeBob SquarePants,Oh that's really sad. I knew a woman with ALS. She died within two years of her diagnosis. She went from full functionality to being pushed in a wheelchair unable to speak. Very devastating. 
SpongeBob SquarePants,"lets bring back the ALS ice bucket challenge, maybe change it to the frozen Sponge challenge or something."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Christ... That guy makes Spongebob what it is...

I'm so sorry, Stephen... I really hope there's something to this that will make it tolerable. Please."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Say what you will about it in its later years, Spongebob did give us some pretty great children's TV in its heyday.  I consider Spongebob to be one of the most important TV shows of my childhood, good or bad, and to get this news is leagues beyond depressing.  It's never fair to see someone who brought so much joy to so many people fall ill to such a terrible disease, but I guess life's never fair, is it?  If watching the people you look up to start to fall ill and die is part of growing up, I don't want it.

Here's hoping for the best.  He deserves much better than this."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Just Googled it, and average life expectancy after diagnosis is 2-5 years... I hope he pulls through, SpongeBob was one of the best cartoons of the 2000s."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Honestly whatever you think of the shows he's been in during any time even what most people consider to be the dark ages of SpongeBob, you're flat out lying if you say this man has had no influence over the animation industry, clearly shown by the quick humor, connections with others who've worked on multiple projects with him, and an overall understanding of what kids like to watch, all of that and more has been shown through the passion of him and everyone else with SpongeBob and beyond, I'd say that's pretty good for a guy who originally studied and made a comic about marine biology. From the shows, books, comics, DVD's, merchandise, and the overall feeling that was given off, everything was thanks to Stephen, and very few people can say they've had that much of a positive impact on over millions of people, shown through strong fanbases, always with memorable quotes to say. Whether it helped them get a laugh to alleviate boredom, or to get their minds off of any troubles and simply relax, whether it be those young enough to be easily impressionable and take a great influence from you, to those actually in the industry, or those burning off a nostalgia rush, his creations are still good for that to this very day. SpongeBob as his crowning achievement has always been a favorite for at least a few generations, and that is absolutely incredible, not to mention others such as Rocko's Modern Life.

Rest well Stephen, wish I could say something more deep and meaningful but in the end the outcome will be the same. Best of luck to you (if he somehow sees this) and the rest of the crew, friends, family, and anyone else close to him going forward, and to anyone else who has had someone they know and care for be struck with any illness that could be as severe as this. Thank you for all the smiles, laughs, and information you've shared with us all. "
SpongeBob SquarePants,So he's done for? Shit. I wouldn't wish ALS on anyone.
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Sad, Hillenburg will be in a league with Disney, Miyazaki, Lasseter, Chuck Jones, Iwerks, Bluth, Fleischer, Hanna & Barbera, Tex Avery, Groening, Mike Judge, Bakshi, Oshii, and Kon. 

Legendary and important artist. "
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Was a primary caregiver to a loved one with ALS. Let me tell you that I would rather get cancer than suffer what they went through. ALS is a terminal illness. There is no cure. Most people die within 2 years of diagnosis. It is extremely rare (almost unheard of, bar Stephen Hawking) to live more than 5 years after diagnosis.

You lose your ability to talk. At first people think you're drunk because you're slurring your words. But as it progresses, the guesswork involved when other people try to decipher what you say increases. Eventually it turns into noises that resemble speech. You can no longer talk to your loved ones, despite the fact your mind is still sound. 

With your speech also goes your ability to swallow You will choke on your own saliva in your sleep. At a certain point, a port will have to be surgically installed on your stomach in order for your caregiver to pump your meals directly into your stomach with a large syringe. 

You begin to go weak in your arms in legs. Your leg will sometimes drop while you're walking, causing you to stumble. Walking up and down stairs becomes less frequent as it becomes more difficult. Eventually sitting upright becomes a chore. 

Your ability to breathe will go as well. After a certain point in the progression of the disease, you will have to begin manually breathing in order to get enough air. When the disease has progressed to the very end, your ability to breathe diminishes to the point that you will die as a result of lack of oxygen."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Freeze him like Walt Disney until ALS gets cured. I'm not joking, I'm tearing up actually since this news sucks shit."
SpongeBob SquarePants,Wtf no
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Having recently watched 'Gleason' l feel terrible for the guy, its a ghastly thing to contemplate, knowing that your quality-of-life  will assuredly keep deteriorating until the wretched end, its the stuff of nightmares."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"My mom was diagnosed last May with ALS. I would never wish ALS on my worst enemy. Seriously. At first you think ""oh he/she just won't be able to move. We'll invest in some Hawking tech and adjust.""  People leave out the constant pain and ridiculous speed it travels. Oh, and you start to learn why people hate insurance companies too. 

I wish Stephen the best. On top of being crazy funny, he seems like a nice guy.  "
SpongeBob SquarePants,"Was just talking about this earlier on Reddit. My mom has ALS, and my father and I have been taking care of her.

I would never ever wish this on my WORST of enemies. There's nothing brave, there's no fight, it's just tragic and it's destroyed our lives. So much time spent, so much pain....I can't even remember her voice. I've cleaned up every bodily function. I've held her to keep her calm as her diaphragm spasms. The crying from frustration, the crying from sadness. I'm in my mid/late twenties, and I'm watching all my peers have relationships and marriages and kids. Meanwhile I'm waking up every hour and a half to adjust her in bed because her muscle mass is so atrophied that her joints become unbearably painful (especially her hips). This wasn't how I'd thought I'd be spending my time at this stage in my life, and I feel like after it's over I'll be a hopeless shell. But that pales in comparison to how she feels. She did everything right in her life; didn't smoke, didn't drink, followed the rules. All her siblings did the opposite and indulged to extreme degrees. She is going to be outlived by all of them.

That's a wall of text, but I'm drinking and just pissed. She had a feeding tube inserted this past Friday and we got oxygen, but I was discussing with my dad how her services are going to go. You know what it's like to hear that your mom actually asked your dad to kill her? Fucking heartbreaking.

That said, still always looking ahead. She's in the late stages now, so it's pretty dire. We find happiness where we can.

EDIT: Thanks for all the kind words, fellow internet strangers. I couldn't even find the time to get proper drunk, I heard the comm system and had to check on her, and then go out to shovel all this godforsaken snow..."
SpongeBob SquarePants,"I just don't know what to say. Reading the title of this post and then the article felt like a stab in the heart. He's one of my inspirations and heroes, if not THE hero. This man is the reason I've worked my whole life to be an animator. From the moment I first laid eyes on SpongeBob I knew I wanted to animate cartoons for a living. SpongeBob literally shaped my life into what it is, just like so many others.

I hoped someday I could meet him... let's hope that stays a possibility for a long, long time.

My thoughts and prayers are with Steve and his family. "
SpongeBob SquarePants,This is absolutely terrible. I hope we're able to see a cure to this terrible disease in our lifetime. 
SpongeBob SquarePants,Does he need a sweater made out of tears?  Because I'm about to make one.  
SpongeBob SquarePants,NOOOOOOO!!! I hope he at least gets to see the SpongeBob musical  :(
SpongeBob SquarePants,I am very sorry to hear this. ALS is a terrible disease. This man has given millions of people a lot of joy.
SpongeBob SquarePants,I'm hoping for the announcement of an ALS cure soon...please. 
SpongeBob SquarePants,My father was diagnosed at 55 and gone by 58.  It's terrifyingly quick.  This man was just as important to my childhood as my father. Hope him the best.  Really do. 
SpongeBob SquarePants,Damn... i don't know what to say
SpongeBob SquarePants,I read there's fewer than 20k case a year. That's extremely rare. Is it genetic or... just get unlucky with it?
Better Call Saul,The two shows ended up being so intertwined that I really don’t think it matters so much to me anymore that I compare them. They are each excellent and they complement each other. I think of them much more as one large story now that Saul is wrapped.
Better Call Saul,The fact that we can go back and forth about this debate proves that we’re incredibly lucky as an audience.
Better Call Saul,It’s only a matter of time till someone cuts it all together chronologically
Better Call Saul,Godfather2 was the best prequel movie ..bcs is the best prequel show .
Better Call Saul,"Something about Breaking Bad is electrifying for me on every single rewatch, but the comparison is quite fascinating here:

“I don’t want to spend too much time comparing Better Call Saul to its predecessor when both are superb shows in their own right, but I do think we’re meant to notice the contrast between them.”

“From a distance, they have roughly similar arcs: Both are about seemingly unassuming, ordinary men turning increasingly toward the dark side.”

“Where they differ is in what each journey seems to say about each man, and how we, as the audience, are encouraged to respond to it.”

“If Breaking Bad was a hallmark of the aughts-era antihero craze, Better Call Saul, especially in the beginning, felt like a response to it.”

“Walt breaking bad was a dark fantasy; Jimmy becoming Saul was a tragedy.”

“Both got their own version of a happy ending, or at least as happy an ending as these writers could give them within the logic of these shows.”

“Walt got to go out in a blaze of glory — dead, but victorious in his way since he’d accomplished most everything he set out to.”

“Saul got to go back to being the best version of Jimmy (at least as far as we’re allowed to see).”

Walt will always be my hero, or should I say anti-hero: there’s something about Heisenberg that never fails to enrapture me."
Better Call Saul,They're both 10 out of 10s for me. They're like one big show.
Better Call Saul,BB maybe had more exciting events but the characters were so much better in BCS. More fleshed out and almost all had a good arc to follow.
Better Call Saul,">	I don’t think Better Call Saul, as breathlessly suspenseful as it often was, was ever on the same level as much of season four of Breaking Bad or certainly something like “Ozymandias,” but **I don’t think Breaking Bad ever had a relationship that I cared about on the same level as Jimmy and Kim’s.**

Right here.  This is it right here.  Since season 2, episode 1, I became hooked into Jimmy and Kim’s relationship.  Literally everything about the show revolves around their relationship, with Kim’s absence from the Breaking Bad era looming large overhead.  Would she be dead by then?  Was she in the background the whole time?  Every moment we spend with them watching an old movie or brushing their teeth builds their relationship but also makes it so their inevitable separation will be that much harder to handle.  And when it does, it hits you *hard.*"
Better Call Saul,"I liked it better.

I felt the characters across the entire cast were much better explained and interesting.
They even made the bad guys likeable."
Better Call Saul,"I think the crux is that Better Call Saul is imbued with Breaking Bad's gravitas from the start due to the connection and aided by it, and Breaking Bad is enrichened by Better Call Saul's fleshing out of key characters. 

I can't call either 'better' (except when then continuing to say 'Call Saul') but they are both exemplary television experiences that IMO will take an insane feat to match. 

The fact that Better Call Saul improves Breaking Bad, the best show I've ever seen, is a testament to both show's quality and shared status atop the pile."
Better Call Saul,"If I haven’t seen either series, which should I watch first? Does it matter?"
Better Call Saul,"For me it was, but that is because Breaking Bad set up the scene. Better Call Saul distilled a dark and dramatic essence from it, so for me it was a more minimalist but also more focused story, but that wouldn't have been possible without Breaking Bad."
Better Call Saul,Please enjoy both shows equally
Better Call Saul,"I feel like they are two sides of the same coin, and in many ways both deserve their praise. Better call Saul is a considerably slower burn than Breaking Bad. Better Call Saul really takes its time to show processes, so when the insanity that was the latter half of the sixth season occurred, it felt like a natural progression: a great feat. However Breaking Bad was arguably going at 100% the entire time, and the audience was able to believe the wild progression of events the entire ride: also and incredible feat. Since the shows are in the same universe, town, timeline they only serve to build off of each other. As great as better call Saul is, it is noticeably aided by the fact that we know where Jimmy is going to end up — he is going to become the shameless (amazing how that was played with in finale) Saul Goodman. We can see the character have small wins, start to “make it” as a lawyer, but we know all roads end on the run, they all lead to Walter White. Breaking Bad was retroactively enriched by Better Call Saul as well. Mike was on his way to an honest life and broke bad with jimmy, Sauls words during his kidnapping turn from funny to tragic, Gus really had to work to get to his position in the trade. It’s hard to compare things that are so co dependent. Every time I am inclined to think better call Saul is a better show I remember it’s entire groundwork was laid from breaking bad. Every time I think breaking bad is better, I think about how much care Better Call Saul put into adding to the universe"
Better Call Saul,I think the Saul plot line is better than Breaking bad but the mike plot line at times a fair bit worse. It was usually fantastic when they intersected though. My main gripe is sometimes the show seems to try way to hard to have breaking bad references. They are different shows though. Breaking bad is like a car crash but Better Call Saul is like someone being poisoned over time.
Better Call Saul,"Whether it was better or not, I don’t know how anyone can argue that BB isn’t the greater show. It has a far greater legacy and is the selling point for the entire universe. The way BB pierced the zeitgeist is akin to that of a “greatest show of all time”, whereas BCS did it in a “one of/the best shows on tv right now!” kinda way."
Better Call Saul,Equal or greater than
Better Call Saul,"I love em both but BCS just feels better to me, more planned out and grounded.

Things I don't like about both are some of the insanely intricate Rube Goldbergy plans and plots that require  almost omniscient levels of foresight. Yet I still think the schemes to take down Howard or Lalo are more believable than knowing where to park in a Nazi stronghold and being lucky enough that the whole gang is there and standing upright when your remote controlled machine gun starts to fire.

For me it's all in the characters and while I think for example Gus worked better in BB, characters like Jimmy, Chuck and Kim are insanely well written and will stick with me for a long time"
Better Call Saul,"No way. Breaking Bad is the better show. 

Breaking Bad wins on originality, audacity, inventiveness.  If we really had to match Cranston's performance against Odenkirk's, wouldn't Bryan Cranston win the palm? Plus the visuals in Breaking Bad are on just another level. 

Definitely, the characters are more lovable in Better Call Saul.  It has a lot more heart, whereas Breaking Bad can go to really uncomfortable, harrowing places with its subject matter.  So I get why people would prefer it. 

Like any multi-season TV shows, you could point to storyline flaws for both of them.  That said, and cultural relevance aside, I don't know how Breaking Bad isn't the one.  The two shows don't accentuate each other so much as one show is contained in the sweep of the greater one."
Better Call Saul,"next up we get to the bottom of ""is chocolate better than vanilla"""
Better Call Saul,Can we enjoy BCS finale without pitting it against BB finale? They both great in their own way and very fitting to the overall story.
Better Call Saul,[deleted]
Better Call Saul,"Even though they're in the same universe, they are such different shows that I think it's difficult to compare them. Breaking Bad is much more action packed, faster paced, and built around situations as much as the characters. Better Call Saul is a much slower burn character study. There are very few ""How them Duke boys gonna get out of this"" episodes and even the ones that do have that, the interest is in how it affects the characters more than how they actually get themselves out of a jam."
Better Call Saul,"Better Call Saul is integrated into Breaking Bad, the last few episodes would be gibberish without it. How could it ever be better if it cannot stand alone?"
Better Call Saul,"Tangential story: I was bartending a Superbowl event a few years ago and had just finished binging breaking bad the night before.  Aaron Paul and his wife came by the bar and hung around for about an hour.  I told him that I just finished his show and thanked him, and he came around the bar and gave me a bear hug, and HE thanked ME.  Genuinely a really nice guy, I wish him nothing but success."
Better Call Saul,Clickbait title but an interesting read.
Better Call Saul,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I thought Better Call Saul was good, but not great. I thought that sometimes it leaned a little bit too heavily on its Breaking Bad ties and wasn’t quite as unique as BB was. A good show, but Breaking Bad is just in another echelon when it comes to TV shows."
Better Call Saul,"I know it's becoming a popular opinion to say Better Call Saul is better than Breaking Bad but after having just rewatched Breaking Bad for the third time and finishing Better Call Saul, I still think Breaking Bad is better. There is some recency bias going on here I think. 

That's not to say Better Call Saul wasn't fantastic because it was and they absolutely nailed the finale it's almost perfect, but it's unfair to compare it to Breaking Bad which for me is the greatest show of all time.

Yes, i think it's better than The Wire before somebody asks lol."
Better Call Saul,Great show but for me it didn't come close to Breaking Bad
Better Call Saul,"i think technically no, but darn if i didn’t like better call saul the most"
Better Call Saul,"No, Breaking Bad has far better pacing.

Season 2 of Saul was a battle of attrition to watch. That aside, the rest of the show is great."
Better Call Saul,I can’t wait to watch the last season on Netflix when it drops in 4 years!
Better Call Saul,In my opinion it has stronger characters than Breaking Bad but BB had a better storyline.
Better Call Saul,I have always thought that Better Call Saul was much better and arguably believable while Breaking Bad never truly was.
Better Call Saul,breaking bad is much more octane and ridiculous while better call saul is more nuanced and has more colourful personalities in its characters
Better Call Saul,"I think Breaking Bad is considerably better than Better Call Saul, although the latter is a very good show overall, just not on the same level.

The primary reason is simple: clarity of vision.

In Breaking Bad, there is a pretty clear idea. In the writer's words, to ""turn Mr. Chips into Scarface."" This is the core driving force of the show, and they never wavered from it. Every season has Walt box himself into a corner that he can only escape through a deeply immoral act, further corroding his soul. They commit to turning this character into a worse person until he's basically the antagonist.

Better Call Saul is lacking this clarity of vision. And the reason is simple. The writers set out to make a show about Saul Goodman, but found they liked Jimmy McGill more. So they dragged their heels to avoid reaching 'Saul', which also led to creating a secondary plotline, largely unrelated to the main one, to put the actors who they cast for other purposes, like Jonathan Banks and Michael Mando.

It's what feels strange about the last episodes. They are overcompensating for making the show about Jimmy by tossing a bunch of Breaking Bad cameos at us, mostly pointless ones. 

I suspect if they could go back in time they'd simply not make the show a Breaking Bad prequel. It ended up doing more harm than good IMO."
Better Call Saul,Yes !
Better Call Saul,They essential are 13 years of the same show let’s be real here.
Better Call Saul,Two halves of the same show
Better Call Saul,No.
Better Call Saul,In some ways Saul was better but overall Breaking Bad is the superior show. However Better Call Saul is still a masterpiece.
Better Call Saul,"If we're gonna compare them, Breaking Bad will always be the winner. I thought BCS was going somewhere special until they went to the Gene timeline, that's when the show became a bit of a slog. Breaking Bad never had moments like that where I really doubted the direction the writers took us in. BCS was simply too much of a letdown in the end to stand beside Breaking Bad. It's a fine show to be sure, but it's just not in the same league. Ranking it among all the shows I watched this year, then it stands just about in the middle of the pack. It was ok, but it was in no way outstanding like people say."
Better Call Saul,Can we not do this and just appreciate both for being fucking excellent pieces of work from two God-tier showrunners?
Better Call Saul,"I think some of you guys need to to rewatch Breaking Bad. It is an absolute masterpiece. Saul is very, very good but has flaws."
Better Call Saul,No
Better Call Saul,No
Better Call Saul,"Same creator, same writers, same story universe, same actors, same antagonists, same anti-heros, same structure. Hard to compare."
Better Call Saul,"No fucking way, I only made it through 1 or 2 seasons of BCS. Too slow/boring for me, great acting but the pacing was off. BB had me on the edge of my seat."
Better Call Saul,"I liked both, but BB was better to me, and it isnt close."
Better Call Saul,no it wasn't. better call saul's earlier seasons were good but like the last half had so many montage filler scenes. the tricks were getting more and more ridiculous and improbable. breaking bad also had a better story arc. bcs was like a meandering adventure.
Better Call Saul,No
Better Call Saul,"I think after Breaking Bad doubled the amount of episodes there was to a season (s2 and onwards) the show developed serious pacing issues, and every season hence had these mid-season lulls where the show would grind to a halt. Better Call Saul never once had these same issues and as a result each season feels so much more consistent in quality."
Better Call Saul,They both compliment each other beautifully and I think we should count ourselves lucky that we managed to get two all-time-best shows out of this universe. No reason to pit them against each other as they do different things better than the other.
Better Call Saul,"It's interesting, because you can obviously tell how Better Call Saul learned from Breaking Bad, so like others have said they do largely function as one big story. But then they are very different in how they tell their stories and what their focuses were. 

We're incredibly fortunate that Better Call Saul ended up being so good that this is a real conversation to have fun with."
Better Call Saul,Both great shows. Better call Saul was a slow burn. Breaking bad is undefeated
Better Call Saul,Is the egg superior to the chicken?
Better Call Saul,"BB was more savage and intense, BCS was more fleshed out and the characters development is impeccable, both together are the best TV thing ever created imo and that's the point behind them"
Better Call Saul,Better Call Saul is a slower burn but it’s great in its own way. Not everything needs to be a competition.
Better Call Saul,Better Call Saul was just too slow for me and the constant montages were too much. We don't need ten minutes of an episode solely devoted to how Saul figures out the timing of security guard Gerry eats a Cinnabon in an episode for the last season. There were just a lot of moments that I felt genuinely bored and could barely finish it. Which never happened in BB.
Better Call Saul,Yes it is.
Better Call Saul,Yes
Better Call Saul,"Yes. Yes it was. Showrunners honed their skills on breaking bad, but really hit their stride in BCS. BCS was everything I loved about BB, but with more likeable main characters, a strong woman-lead, and more time with Mike. Why isn't Rhea Seahorn in everything? Lalo is one of the scariest villains ever! He was always smiling. That's scary."
Better Call Saul,"It’s a tough call to make, but I think Saul’s closing surpassed breaking bad’s for me. There was also more of a variety in the story overall with all the court related stuff which was separate from later on where it lined up more with the breaking bad universe, and the problems that come from that world. Overall though it’s win win, both are amazing, and the performances from both show was truly top tier!"
Better Call Saul,"Perhaps because they had more time to be fleshed out, the main characters in BCS were much more complexly drawn, and had more subtle motivations for behaving the way they did. 

But BB had better plot twists, faster pacing, more unexpected and thrilling bursts of action, and a much more complicated *array* of intertwined characters."
Better Call Saul,"The story of Jimmy McGill is the best of the Heisenbergverse. I cared less for the drug game in BCS, until Lalo showed up. So while overall I think BB is more consistent, the highs of BCS are the highest of anything."
Better Call Saul,"Honestly I hated the first season of BCS. I guess I was expecting something different, idk. For those of you who maybe didn’t love it at first, when did that change? There’s so many shows to start or catch up on I admittedly don’t have the patience I used to (first world problems I know 😂)"
Better Call Saul,Eh…. BB was a bit a technical masterpiece… it was like watching a perfect Olympic routine… I’ll never watch it all again though. BCS was close to the same without any of the high pressure tension.
Better Call Saul,"Yes, yes it was."
Better Call Saul,"Yes. Would rewatch Saul, BB not so sure."
Better Call Saul,No. Breaking Bad is in a league of its own. It’s the greatest show start to finish of all time. The only show that could have even come close is Game of Thrones but we all know how that went.
Better Call Saul,"No. Vince Gilligan stepped away as showrunner during the middle seasons of Better Call Saul and the quality dipped. It was still a very fine show, but it was missing that genius that Gilligan brings and that was present through all of Breaking Bad."
Better Call Saul,Not even close. Breaking Bad is still pinnacle TV
Better Call Saul,"I was never that big a fan of BB but atleast it was fast  and engaging.


BCS would show you a pot of boiling water for 30 secs then a rocking chair for another 30 secs..."
Better Call Saul,Yes.
Better Call Saul,No. Not even close.
Better Call Saul,Breaking bad had better last season than btc. Although btc was the better watch at the beginning through second last season
Better Call Saul,Who cares. Don’t go on to compare them and make it a this versus that. Just enjoy what we got. Hate this shit.
Better Call Saul,No.
Better Call Saul,No
Better Call Saul,"Well, yes. BCS took the lessons from BB's few but serious mistakes and not only fixed them, they went beyond what was necessary. Obviously BB is an incredible show, but BCS is about as perfect as any show can possibly be."
Better Call Saul,No
Better Call Saul,"Better Call Saul is more consistent, but the highs of Breaking Bad are unparalleled. Breaking Bad wins on just how fantastic the last season is."
Better Call Saul,Not a question to be answered. They are both great shows respectively.
Better Call Saul,2 chapters of the same book
Better Call Saul,No.
Better Call Saul,"They are on par with one another, it's all good man."
Better Call Saul,Not even close. I'm having a hard time even finishing these last few episodes. The last one I watched was the all black and white one and it was coma inducing...
Better Call Saul,Saul kind of had its head pretty far up its own ass at the end. Also never had anything like the chemistry of Walt & Jesse.
Better Call Saul,"No.

While both had excellent writing and acting, Breaking Bad had a warped humour to it that kept it light despite the dark topic.  The ""Everyone knows its windy"" cold opening was one of the funniest things I have seen on TV...to say nothing of Walt tossing the pizza on the roof.

BCS lacked that humour and ended up being dark and depressing.

IMHO, Breaking Bad wins and it isn't close."
Better Call Saul,Pretty damn good but nope
Better Call Saul,No way. It was awesome though.
Better Call Saul,"If you separate then no.

BB was the better TV.

But combined they make the best show since The Wire."
Better Call Saul,No. But it was still great.
Better Call Saul,I couldn’t get past first episode
Better Call Saul,Both excellent but bb
Better Call Saul,Not in the fucking least bit.
Better Call Saul,He looks like the guy from ‘The Lovely Bones’
Better Call Saul,"I do love both shows, they are very different shows that complement each other so well and Breaking Bad had the best acting performance of all time by Bryan Cranston.
That being said BCS is an easy winner for me.
Much better character development especially for the supporting characters. The cinematography in BCS is amazing. The visual storytelling made this show so unique as well. Finally the story of the show is funnier much more engaging and more relatable for me."
Better Call Saul,No.
Better Call Saul,No

Absolutely Fabulous,"God I need to do a rewatch again. These idiots never fail to make me laugh, especially bubble. Patsy and Eddie are gonna go on my future tattoo sleeve"
Absolutely Fabulous,Nobody remembers sapphire and steel.
Absolutely Fabulous,"“One more face lift on this one and she’ll have a beard.”

I aspire to be Patsy. 

Sadly, Ab Fab is also responsible for cursing us with the pathetic attempt to recreate an American version, “High Society.”  But if you’re not going to commit to well written jokes about drugs and sex then it’s going to be crap."
Absolutely Fabulous,"Wheels on fire, rolling down the roooooaad!"
Absolutely Fabulous,I just like it when Eddie is in hospital and is seemingly hallucinating Lady Penelope at her bedside.
Absolutely Fabulous,I remember how cool I thought I was cuz I had an abfab T-shirt in hs
Absolutely Fabulous,I adore this show.
Absolutely Fabulous,This show really symbolises the 90s. The economy was on fire and the cold war was over.
Absolutely Fabulous,I’m chanting as we speak
Absolutely Fabulous,Still my favourite comedy tv series
Absolutely Fabulous,"I loved the role reversal. Saffy was the responsible one where her mother and Patsy were the wild ones, living for the next party. This is one of my wife's favorite shows."
Absolutely Fabulous,This show is a guilty pleasure of mine. These two are hilarious.
Absolutely Fabulous,"Ah, I love modern entertainment 'journalism'. It's just a constant stream of articles from 25 year olds talking about how we've all forgotten about a very famous show that came out 25+ years ago."
Absolutely Fabulous,Great show
Absolutely Fabulous,Such a great show!
Absolutely Fabulous,I grew up watching this with my dad. It’s still just as hilarious.
Absolutely Fabulous,">	Im chanting as we speak

LOL the most famous line for all Buddhists and meditators. 

And it was actually said by the inspiration for Edina Monsoon, publicist Lynne Franks"
Absolutely Fabulous,"Preaching to the choir **sweetie**

I think you buried one of the leads regarding this show though understandable since it pertains to the DVD's.

It seems like it's been decades since I watched the DVD outtakes on repeat with tears and snot running down my face, I have never since laughed so hard.

Comedy gems and genius all around."
Absolutely Fabulous,I was partially raised on this show so it has always held a special place in my heart. Thankfully my mom is like neither of these women.
Absolutely Fabulous,Love Ab Fab and Kath & Kim. In that genre gotta check out Gavin & Stacey. The supporting characters are brilliant!
Absolutely Fabulous,One of the GOAT
Absolutely Fabulous,Money! Keys! Passport!
Absolutely Fabulous,I was obsessed with AbFab in the late 90s. It would air on Comedy Central daily and watching episodes became a compulsion.
Absolutely Fabulous,You little bitch troll from hell!
Absolutely Fabulous,Season 1-3 was PERFECT. Season 4 was hit and miss. Season 5 was unwatchable.
Absolutely Fabulous,"I used to love the show, until the one christmas special where Edina strikes a toddler in the face. I just couldn't watch that show anymore after that."
Absolutely Fabulous,Oh no I used to love it but it's not aged well at all.
Absolutely Fabulous,The movie was good.
Absolutely Fabulous,They have always reminded me of my mother and her best friend when I was growing up. It wasn't fun to live with that but I loved them all the same.
Absolutely Fabulous,"This show always came on in the afternoons in the summer on comedy central in my childhood. I never got into it, I was too young to ""get it"". Maybe I should give it another try."
Absolutely Fabulous,Vueve!
Absolutely Fabulous,the same can't be said for the mid-90s american rehash High Society
Absolutely Fabulous,"Gautier, darling. Names, names, names."
Absolutely Fabulous,Can I have the house?
Absolutely Fabulous,I’d also recommend watching their respective versions of Shameless
Absolutely Fabulous,"Yep both shows follow vain, spoiled, misguided, social climbers who give horrible advice and invite constant ridicule for the abysmal decision making their characters exhibit. One treats these characters as role models, the other does it ironically, treating them like the joke they are."
Absolutely Fabulous,HOW?!
Absolutely Fabulous,Oooooo gin and tonic!
Absolutely Fabulous,“Small Opening” even the title still makes me laugh. Best ep ever!
Absolutely Fabulous,"Where are my dippity bix?

The wedding with Sharon and the horse hair switch is a seminal moment in television history."
Absolutely Fabulous,I would say they’re both just as funny as the other
Absolutely Fabulous,I feel like Eddie and Patsy are closer to the English equivalent of Prue and True.
Absolutely Fabulous,Look at me Kim Loook at MOOIII
Absolutely Fabulous,Just Watch says it’s on Hulu.
Absolutely Fabulous,It's on BritBox.
Absolutely Fabulous,"It’s on Hoopla, you can log in and use that with a library card (if your library supports it) for free."
Absolutely Fabulous,i do the bloke from The Man from UNCLE and the woman from The New Adventures wandering around empty sets scared the absolute bejesus out of us as kids
Absolutely Fabulous,"I hate you! Just when my life hit a good patch, along you came, you miserable piece of flesh. You should've ended up in the dust bin! The incinerator was too good for you! You know, when I heard that Eddie was pregnant, I told her to abort! ABORT, ABORT, ABORT! I said ""Chuck it down the pan!"". I said ""Bring me... a knitting needle!"""
Absolutely Fabulous,"Best notify my next of kin, this wheel shall explode.

Saffy certainly has awoken a fetish in me for uncomfortable nerdy girls in huge sweaters."
Absolutely Fabulous,Mariane Faithful!
Absolutely Fabulous,"Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger and the Trinity"
Absolutely Fabulous,You WERE fucking cool!
Absolutely Fabulous,The new episodes aired on Monday nights. I LIVED for those nights and would laugh until my body hurt.
Absolutely Fabulous,That one S5 episode where Edina brought home the wrong baby is a classic for me amongst the earlier ones.
Absolutely Fabulous,But that wasn't played as a joke - it was the final straw and made Saffy throw them out of the house (quite literally in Patsys case 🤣)
Absolutely Fabulous,"I think you can say that for many 90s comedies though. Comedy mocks modern culture. 

Hence why when we watch it 30 years later, we go, 'ugh, were we really like that?'"
Absolutely Fabulous,And The Office
Absolutely Fabulous,At least AbFab is funny!
Absolutely Fabulous,He just hates them says they are annoying. It’s ok I can watch this on my own.
Absolutely Fabulous,Cool. I'll give it a go
Absolutely Fabulous,"Aha, I get you."
Absolutely Fabulous,Jane Turner is amazing ...le sigh. A real comedic genius.
Absolutely Fabulous,Yes it was great!
Absolutely Fabulous,The way Patsy cries after Saffy slaps her is seared into my brain.
Absolutely Fabulous,False
Absolutely Fabulous,Yeah I can't imagine Game On has dated well!
Absolutely Fabulous,"AbFab is fuckin hilarious. At least they realised acting that way was something to be made fun of, not admired. Still holds up today. SATC is horribly dated now."
Absolutely Fabulous,"That's kinda the point? Patsy and Eddie are awful people, you're not supposed to like them"
Absolutely Fabulous,Gabon.  Gabon.  Is he from Gabon?
Absolutely Fabulous,Hey. You had an Ab fucking Fab t-shirt!
Absolutely Fabulous,"I hated SATC and still do. They took themselves seriously as something to aspire to.
As horrible as Patsy and Eddie are as people, I would take them anyday over the SATC foursome."
Absolutely Fabulous,That’s what makes me *love* them.
Absolutely Fabulous,That doesn't make them *entertaining*. I hate this show so much.
Absolutely Fabulous,"Oh for sure, he just actually hates them."
Absolutely Fabulous,I remember not having a clue what was going on in this show as a kid except they were always drunk maybe
Absolutely Fabulous,This has been on Hulu for a while. I watch it on and off when I go to sleep
Absolutely Fabulous,"I think my favorite scene was when Eddy finds out her daughter is pregnant and that the father is black.  So excited that her grand kid will be mixed race (the Chanel of babies) she goes into a hilarious daydream scene where shes walking down Harlem high fiving black people, holding the child in her arms like it was a fashion accessory."
Absolutely Fabulous,It’s been on there for months.
Absolutely Fabulous,Baby Spice as Baby Spice was a nice twist.
Absolutely Fabulous,This show is how I fell in love with British Humor
Absolutely Fabulous,I liked this show when it aired. But I suspect it will have aged out of irrelevance into almost assholish obliviousness in todays era.
Absolutely Fabulous,Now if someone would just share their password with me…
Absolutely Fabulous,I don't think Eddie & Patsy knew what was going on half the time either.
Absolutely Fabulous,Same for me! I recently watched the movie and enjoyed it as well.
Absolutely Fabulous,"Insult comedy is pretty timeless actually, haha"
Absolutely Fabulous,Rotate your streaming services
You Are Beautiful,"Finished Season 3 of Barry. Very funny, had the balls to do what Dexter should have."
You Are Beautiful,Found Schitt's Creek on Amazon/Freevee. I’ve heard it’s really good
You Are Beautiful,Currently wrapping up Banshee. What a fantastic show.
You Are Beautiful,"Got here to thanks the recommendation and praise **Halt and Catch Fire**, such underrated show!"
You Are Beautiful,I’m a couple years late but I’m just about finished with Dopesick on Hulu. I don’t think I’ve ever been more enraged at some characters in a series before. Very powerful stuff. Michael Keaton is fantastic.
You Are Beautiful,2nd season of **Perry Mason** Great show.
You Are Beautiful,"About half in **Class of '07** on Amazon Prime and seriously, I love it so much. The all women cast is great, and it's humor is exactly my cup of tea. 100% recommend!"
You Are Beautiful,"Ted lasso season 3- loved the first episode of the new season 

Perry Mason season 2- Why is nobody talking about this show?? It is so good and I'm finding season 2 to be really good so far 

The Mandalorian season 3- loving this show 

Star trek Picard season 3- 5 episodes in and this is the best Picard season by far, so engaging with a fascinating plot"
You Are Beautiful,**Swarm**... Oh this show *crazy* crazy
You Are Beautiful,"I watched and loved The Expanse, though the ending was (understandably, given the shortened final season) jarringly abrupt.  Highly recommend it… great sci fi and political intrigue.

I’m just getting to the end of the first season of The Leftovers… Great show but an absolutely torturous watch, if that makes sense.  I feel like I need to chase every episode with something funny or light."
You Are Beautiful,"Oh man, Bosch is so freakin’ good. On Season 4 episode 8. I advise anyone who judged the show off season 1, to continue. So good.

RIP Lance."
You Are Beautiful,"So what are we all supposed to do this Sunday with no **The Last of Us** and **Succession** still a week away? Interact with our families? Smh

Finished season one of the video game zombie show, almost done with **Poker Face**, keeping up with **Top Chef** (shout-out the two Canadians on this season, both looking strong so far) and **Abbott Elementary**."
You Are Beautiful,"Highly recommend Swarm on Prime. It’s crazy, unnerving, and has plenty of twists. I can’t remember the last time a show sucked me in this fast"
You Are Beautiful,"Bit late to the party, but I just discovered how great The Americans is. I decided to give it a go after watching the first season of Perry Mason and being very impressed with Matthew Rhys, glad I did."
You Are Beautiful,"This is an anti-recommendation. I randomly stumbled over a dance choreography reality tv show on Netflix (""Dance 100"") and this show must have some of the most awfully edited performances of all time. Random zooms and close ups, weird and frantic pans and idiotic crowd reaction shots awkwardly put together. The actual dancing seems to have been secondary to whoever edited this thing. 

Add a stage production that at times completely floods the zone with fire balls or flood lights. 

Don't get me started on the rest of the show. What an utter failure lol."
You Are Beautiful,"Watching  shadow and bone.

The writing is still ok but this is a huge letdown from the first season.

The first season actually gave you this brand new universe type feel.......

The second doesnt. Even worse they're plotting out some battle of the ages shit with an extremely more limited cast than the first season.

Idk if it was shot during the pandemic or it was budget cuts or what..

But you cant emphasize some big conflict that is about to occur while never showing more than 15 or 20 ppl on screen at a time.

The first season had literally fields and cities of actors and extras.. you got the feeling you were in  this massive other world which is always part of the appeal to fantasy shows.

This season it's just a large sound stage that can hold 30 to 40 ppl at best. And once you realize how downsized the show is you cant get it out of your mind 

The writing isn't that bad. Tho it does play on some heavily used tropes..the actual story isn't bad. But the show is not even close to what it was the first season"
You Are Beautiful,"Swarm - 2 episodes in, utterly bizarre and I have no idea what I’m watching but I know I’ll be watching the rest as fast as possible"
You Are Beautiful,"Just binged Yellowjackets s1 in time for season 2 in a few days. It's so bat shit crazy. I loved it. The whole cast is incredible. 

I started The Wire for the first time last week. I'm only a few episodes in and liking it. Not loving it yet.

Doing a catch up on Chicago Fire with s8.  Always have and always will love this show. >!I miss Otis though.!<

Also think I'm going to start Perry Mason. With s3 three starting soon, seems like a good idea.

And watching my weekly shows. The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, Superman & Lois (s3 started this week), Daisy Jones,  Chicago PD and Vanderpump Rules for my reality fix."
You Are Beautiful,Lucky Hank was decent. Not jaw dropping or anything but looked like a quality show that I expect to watch every week.
You Are Beautiful,Wait when did Star Trek Picard get so good? Last 2 episodes have been 10/10.
You Are Beautiful,"Just finished first episode of Extrapolations. Some thoughts.

Plot is not that interesting or exciting. A little preachy. 

Matthew Rhys and Heather Graham kill it in this episode. So fun to watch both of them ! 

I really do not recognize Kit Harington. Are we sure he is the same guy who plays Jon snow? Ok this is a joke but really he look so different.

I am guessing they paid BIG bucks for so many people to come on to the show.

I will continue watching."
You Are Beautiful,Star Trek Picard Season 3 is great so far!
You Are Beautiful,"Pretty Mason S1. 

Shadow & Bone S2. 

Warrior S1. 

His Dark Materials S3. 

A Spy Among Friends. 

The Bureau. 

12 monkeys. 

Dark. 

Just finished all the seasons to The Boys,  The Last of Us, and both seasons of Slow Horses.  All great shows"
You Are Beautiful,"Some of these weekly TV shows have become my main coping mechanism for such a stressful few weeks in the rest of life. It’s nice to escape to both new and familiar worlds. I’m overly positive on these shows because, well, life is tough right now and these help me through it.

**Star Trek Picard** continues to be fantastic. It gets better each and every episode - and last week’s was a banger! No spoilers - but if you loved TNG this season is wonderful.

**The Mandalorian** felt a lot like Andor this week. I really enjoyed the whole middle of the episode - it was some great, new world building - but I missed seeing Mando during it. The beginning scenes were some of the best I’ve seen!

**The Bad Batch** was a really nice feel good episode. I’m enjoying our heroes learning about what life should be like. And completely expecting that to be ripped away.

**Ted Lasso** is back! And I can’t wait to see where this season takes Richmond and Ted. Up the Greyhounds!

Binged the last 5 episodes of **The Last of Us**. Some of these episodes could have been a whole season for The Walking Dead. I’m impressed with how much they’re able to focus on moving the plot forward while creating a compelling apocalyptic world - and building these character’s relationship. The jump between episodes 8 & 9 was a little abrupt but overall a great new show!

**Shadow & Bone** took a while for me to remember the first season. But this is a great show that my wife and I can enjoy watching together. I need a good recap of season 1 though."
You Are Beautiful,"The first episode of **Class of '07** was hilarious. An apocalypse hits an aussie girls' school reunion. Great cast, super witty writing, it's on Prime, watch it!"
You Are Beautiful,I assumed Succession S4 was premiering tonight since TLoU ended… F Me!
You Are Beautiful,"Binged Swarm, and it gave me nightmares 😅"
You Are Beautiful,Pretty excited about lucky hank.  New party down is great.
You Are Beautiful,"Rewatching **House M.D**, after so many years it still holds up amazingly. Hugh Laurie is an incredible actor. Even though it has 20+ episodes a season, I'm not tired of it(into season 4). One of my favourite shows of all time.

I have also been watching alot of Korean Shows(The Glory, My Name, HellBound, All of Us Are Dead etc). I tried to watch  **Vincenzo** and could not get into it, reminded me of a cheesy CW show. The most off putting and annoying thing was that main character constantly had his face brightened by 1000%? I don't understand that."
You Are Beautiful,"**Poker Face**--  I'm 6 episodes in, and it is okay.  I don't mind knowing the killer in the beginning a la Columbo and Law and Order: Criminal Intent.  But I do wish there was more detective work to get there.  It's hard to put my finger on it but I just don't think Natasha Lyonne carries it.  

**Perry Mason**-- I loved the first season and so far the second season is good too.  I love watching period pieces."
You Are Beautiful,"About to start **Shirking** because I've been reading a lot of good things about the show here. Better nor disappoint!

At the third episode of **Alice in Borderland**. It's okay, a tad bit over the top with action sequence, too exaggerated and sometimes the scenes and dialogues are way too long for the context.

Excited to watch **Shadow and Bones**, waited on this show for a long time.

Discontinued **Carnival Row** after first episode (Season one) due to many mixed reviews for season two. Amazon has done a unique job ruining three fantasy shows. I have a feeling that **Warhammer** could be a change that Amazon needs now that Henry Cavill is on it.

*TLOU*, I LOVED IT!"
You Are Beautiful,Just gonna say RIP Lance Reddick. Just finished binging **BOSCH**. Weekend ruined. Fucking po-lice
You Are Beautiful,"RIP to Lance Reddick 🙏🏼

Broyles from Fringe, if you don’t know him by name"
You Are Beautiful,"I'll watch the final episode of The Last Of Us with my family this weekend. Excited to see it!

I also plan on binging the second season of Shadow and Bone on Netflix. The series is based on the Shadow and Bone trilogy by Leigh Bardugo. It is part-fantasy, part-drama, and part-adventure.

It's been a while since I've read the trilogy, which is a part of a whole fantasy universe called the Grishaverse (besides the S&B trilogy, it also covers two duologies). But both the book and TV series really remind me of Avatar: The Last Airbender (elemental magic), Game of Thrones (different nations and political intrigue), and Ocean's 11 (heists). So if you like any of these things, consider giving Shadow and Bone a try. Note that it is an adaptation of a young adult novel, so expect a little bit of romance and awkward (sometimes cringe-worthy) fantasy dialogue."
You Are Beautiful,"*Class of ‘07*

Really fun and entertaining ensemble comedy with an interesting premise and a great cast"
You Are Beautiful,_Shrinking_ might have the most likeable characters of any show I've seen. There is no B-plot. Each character is funny and charming in their own way.
You Are Beautiful,"**Poker Face** \- up to Ep 8 - I really like it - an episode every few days.  Lots of great guest stars. 

**Clarkson's Farm** S2 - Jeremy and Kaleb are hilarious Frick and Frack.  I love the cast of side characters.  Cows!

**Pretty Hard Cases** S3 - it can be a little cringey, but I've loved the character development between Kelly and Sam.  And I like how they unfold the police investigations over the season.

Hate-watching **Inventing Anna** because I needed something purely trashy that I had downloaded when there was a 5 hour internet outage here.  I'll likely finish it out.  I'm intrigued by some of the supporting cast.  I didn't realize it was a Shonda show until I started into it.

Finishing up **All Creatures Great and Small** S3.  Not my favourite of the seasons with TB and WW2 both at play - but still wonderful characters and scenery.  

Next up - **Shrinking**."
You Are Beautiful,"Binged all of Swarm tonight, I loved the first 5 episodes, not sure on the last two at the moment. Really good soundtrack."
You Are Beautiful,"Started Star Trek: Strange New Worlds on a whim after not really watching any trek since TNG and I’m absolutely blown away so far. It weirdly reminds me a lot of The Orville, which I always loved for feeling like classic trek but with a modern look, which is exactly what Strange New Worlds is but better and more serious."
You Are Beautiful,"It's a bit confusing that with The Swarm and Swarm we have two (very different) shows out right now.

Anyways, while Glover's Swarm got lukewarm reviews, stylistically the first episode has me intrigued."
You Are Beautiful,"**Ted Lasso**- season 3 - So glad its back, don't see what all the griping is about, solid episode I don't see any fall off in quality. 

OK - one gripe, Keeley and Roy breakup seems pretty transparently there because its likely an easy way to create drama for them to ultimately get back together. But the scene with his niece was still beautifully done.

Nathan is such a great foil for Ted - am really interested to see how this all plays out.

**Picard** add me to the pile of those who say this show is really really good this season and each episode seems to get even better.(SPOILERISH)  Was great to see Michelle Forbes again - really missed her character when she was written out of TNG

**Abbott Elementary** - Gold star to them for doing gods work and taking on the whole issue of Charter Schools - something rarely addressed in the media in anything but glowing terms."
You Are Beautiful,Finishing up the last season of **Atypical** while I wait for Yellowjackets and Succession to return.
You Are Beautiful,"**Star Trek: Picard** has been so good so far this season. I know people were burned by the first two seasons, and I get it, but hear me out. There's a new showrunner that actually knows how to do proper TV sci fi (Terry Matalas), the balance between fan service and actually telling a good story is great, they're taking the lore and the characters seriously and everyone seems to be having so much fun. The last 3 eps especially have been incredible Star Trek and incredible sci fi, you can really feel the stakes and what the characters are going through. 

And, without spoiling anything, it's going places that are really surprising and interesting. I saw someone on twitter call this season Star Trek >!Among Us but with changelings!< and that stuck with me, spot on description lol.

And the way they've actually held back on a lot of the fan service is impressive. We're halfway through the season and only now did >!Picard and Riker get a hold of Worf. No Geordi yet either, or whomever Spiner's going to be portraying this time.!<

They could still bungle it, but if the second half of the season keeps up this pace I say give Matalas the keys to the franchise, let him do whatever he wants in this era of Trek. A USS Titan series with Shaw as the Captain and Seven as the first officer, maybe?"
You Are Beautiful,"**Swarm** has been a *very* pleasant treat! 4 episodes in and im absolutely in love with the show’s vibe

The story is dark and can be pretty intense at times, and i love how it just keeps getting more deranged, hope it keeps that up to the end!

Whatever film or lighting they’re using gives every shot a very nostalgic feel for me. The cinematography is great, and i really like the odd ratio it’s filmed in. Never seen it before.

Also it’s one of those shows that has the logo in a different texture every episode, and that’s something that always puts a stupid grin on my face

EDIT: Just finished the show. Oh my *god*, what an ending!!! One of the better shows ive seen in the past year. They stretched the show’s concept in ways i wouldnt have ever expected and it was incredible. Definitely give this one a watch if the trailer interests you at all"
You Are Beautiful,"These two new
Amazon series are legit bingeworthy.

**Swarm** - some twisted, fever dream like show. Good and different.

**Class of 07** - Endearing with an ensemble cast that worked quite well. Laid back, entertaining watch that produced quite a few laughs."
You Are Beautiful,"My Name (Netflix) - Just finished this great and criminally overlooked series yesterday! Nearly perfect action and mystery series. 

FROM (MGM+... formerly Epix) - Cool puzzle box of a series that will have you looking up Norse Runes and mythical creatures trying to figure out what the hell is going on. It's great for inspiring audience engagement and the subreddit is fun for looking at theories. 

[FROM link](https://www.epix.com/series/from)

[My Name trailer](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZOl7iOrD31Q&si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE)"
You Are Beautiful,"You could argue that it has its flaws but I have been absolutely loving the new season of Party Down. 

The most recent episode with >!Henry tripping out on mai tais and peoples shirts had me cracking up!< 

I can't believe there's only two episodes left. Please watch it. I can't handle this show being cancelled again."
You Are Beautiful,swarm might not be amazing but it’s so unique and different i love it
You Are Beautiful,"Watching second season of Slow Horses, so good!"
You Are Beautiful,Class of 07. Is fucking great
You Are Beautiful,"Almost done re-watching **The Peripheral** and finding it really rewarding. The writing is so tight, every scene and the dialogue is all there for a reason and ties together even if some of it connects much later on. I know the show has gotten pushback from fans of the book bc they changed much of the plot, but as someone who’s favorite writer is Gibson and favorite book is Neuromancer I’m telling you try giving it another shot with an open mind. They stay so true to the core characters (the Flynn-Burton dynamic is right out the book) and they pull off the world-building so well. The ideas are all there too. 

I also think they do a good job mirroring his writing style, one hallmark of which is to just drop you in running with no handholding whatsover. Fast paced with so much happening it can take time to understand how the threads fit, but all there for a reason. I suspect they knew that wouldn’t be for everyone and I think it’s pretty cool they did it anyway."
You Are Beautiful,"Well I finished the Last of Us. Never played the game but I more or less know the story and decided to give the show a shot and I loved it. Especially Joel and Ellie’s relationship in the series. 


After finishing that show, I decided to watch the first two Creed movies on HBO since I just watched the 3rd film two weeks ago and I loved both films."
You Are Beautiful,"**The Last of Us** S1 - great drama set in a horror / dystopian setting. Maizin is amazing. Pascual & Ramsey are gonna get the emmys for this, and hopefully Nick Offerman for guest star. 

**Only Murders in the Building** S1 & S2 - delightful binge. It has that movie magic twinkle, excited for S3 with Meryl Streep. This is a really brilliant move for Selena's career, as she plays a voice of a (true crime) generation character. 

**Alaska Daily** - bold opening. Hillary Swank headlines this but the rest of the cast hold their own and are quite charming. It's a decent newsroom drama in a time where trust on the media is contentious."
You Are Beautiful,"Currently binging Regular show damn i miss the show.

I'm loving Perry Mason s2 so much i think its better than s1. Are you guys watching ?

Also unfortunately dropped Hello tomorrow, i wanted  it to be good but it lost me. Dropping Mando s3 until the season is done it has lost me ngl."
You Are Beautiful,"Watching **The Old Man**.

Only two episodes in, but I’m finding it a surprisingly refreshing take on the “old guy has to return to his life of violence” genre. More nuanced than I expected, with good performances from the cast."
You Are Beautiful,"I have a busy weekend ahead! Watching The White Lotus for the first time. Almost done with season 1.

I'm intrigued by Swarm on Amazon Prime, so I'll watch that this weekend too.

Then Shadow and Bone and the latest two episodes of Abbott Elementary for something light!

(I'm also behind on The Good Doctor...but that's because I'm a completionist and I have to see the series through)"
You Are Beautiful,"Does anyone have recommendations for shows like Daisy Jones and The Six?

I like the whole drama / romance going between Daisy and Billy . Doesn't necessarily have to be about musicians just the drama."
You Are Beautiful,"The Other Two.
There’s two seasons with the third coming out in May and am mad I’m just hearing about it but glad it’s still going"
You Are Beautiful,"Oh man… missing a Good Friday night premiere… got spoiled by Sundays **The Last of Us**, Mondays **Perry Mason**, Tuesdays **Ted Lasso**, Wednesdays **Mandalorian**, Thursday’s **Shrinking**. Any Good Friday night must watch? 

Looking forward to **Happiness** and **Succession** on Sunday."
You Are Beautiful,"I have been re watching Fringe for the past month, felt like not too long ago I finished up Vox Machina, and my older brother just beat Horizon. So Lance Reddick has been brought up a lot. Really sad to hear, though I know I won't forget about him anytime soon"
You Are Beautiful,"Watching Extrapolations. Without spoiling anything, I'd rate it either 6 or 7 out of 10 so far. And its message about climate chane is roughly as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face, so if you find heavy handed morals off-putting it may not be the show for you. Though for this case there's a good argument the heavy handedness is justified."
You Are Beautiful,"5 episodes into S2 of Justified and I'm loving it! Highly recommend this show! 

I somehow gotta complete this before City Primeval arrives."
You Are Beautiful,"despite all the uncertainty that I feel about Swarm, it's very bingeable. 7.5/10"
You Are Beautiful,"**Swarm**

It took about two episodes to really hit with me it once it did I was all in. There’s  a tricky balancing act at play here considering the protagonist is so … complicated I guess would be the right word. It’s a revenge story where the audience is not on board with the revenge and yet we still( at least I did) have at least some sympathy for the main character.

It’s an interesting take on the para-social relationships that are becoming more and more common and how easy it is to obsess over seemingly disposable social media posts. An offhand remark becomes much bigger when the person reading it doesn’t have much else in terms of social interaction. Also, I just love how the celebrity was meant to be Beyoncé, with barely any attempt to hide it. In fact, they just at kept adding details to make it even more obvious. 

Sure there’s some hand-wavy things and maybe there is some fat to cut but the performances are top notch and I think the touches of the surreal add a lot to dreamy vibe of the show."
You Are Beautiful,Hey guys I finished banshee and person of interest as well as reached. All super good for my tastes. What should I watch next.
You Are Beautiful,"I finished season 2 of Shadow And Bone and sadly I didn't enjoy it as much as season 1. The production quality is still top notch, but the story really felt like it suffered from being split into so many POVs that didn't necessarily mesh"
You Are Beautiful,"I caught up on Trying. This show surprised me. It's quirky and I really like the relationship between the main characters. 

I am working on finishing up the final season of The Mosquito Coast -- I can see why this show was canceled."

You Are Beautiful,"**Watching**: *Daisy Jones and the Six* S.L, *Extrapolations* S.L, *The Mandalorian* S.3, *Party Down* S.3, *Perry Mason* S.2, *Rain Dogs* S.1, *Shrinking* S.1, & *Snowfall* S.6 

**Finished**: *The Last of Us* S.1 (**A**) & *Servant* S.4 (**B-**) 

**Dropped** (for now; will finish when I've got more time): *Dear Edward*, *Hello Tomorrow!*, *History of the World: Part II*, *Liasion*, & *Truth Be Told*"
You Are Beautiful,I started watching Barry the other day. Just finished S2 E5 already. This show is legit incredible. A really dark comedy for those interested
You Are Beautiful,**School Spirits** is a lot better than I expected. Mystery show where the detective is a murdered high school student. I was hooked right at the ending of episode 1.
You Are Beautiful,Shadow and Bone season 2
You Are Beautiful,"Watched the new show on The CW, 'Gotham Knights'... it sucks. The network won't be the same this time next year.  I'm genuinely surprised they renewed 'All American'.

'Gotham Knights', 'Kung Fu', 'Walker: Independence', 'All American: Homecoming', 'Superman & Lois' and 'The Winchesters' are definitely getting canned.

'Riverdale', 'The Flash' and 'Nancy Drew' are ending after their next seasons.

The only other thing that might survive the death of scripted programming on The CW is 'Walker'."
You Are Beautiful,"What was that German/International scifi show that had some sort of aquatic alien intelligence and crab pandemic? The trailer was posted here awhile ago, but I forgot the title."
You Are Beautiful,"Would you all recommend Sucession or Ozark first?? I'm probably going to start one thus week, and I'm a bit indecisive on which one, lol"
You Are Beautiful,"I really enjoyed **Swarm.**  Darkly comedic and creepy, and really nails the obsessive stan behavior I've seen on social media."
You Are Beautiful,"Just watched **The Last of Us** finale and there isn't really that much to say other than I loved it all. I guess the only downside is that some of the episodes are so incredibly good that the not-quite-as-good episodes feel bad in comparison, when they're really not. I thought episode three was emotionally devastating in the best way possible and I love when a show or movie has that much effect on me. For me it's worthy to be on the short list of 10 out of 10 shows. It does enough for me.

I also finally got around to watching all of **Ted Lasso**, which I had been putting off for a bit because I was ""saving it"". Like... I knew it was going to be good so I didn't want to rush it. I'm a bit weird that way. I'd put it alongside all of the other (fairly) recent feel-good comedies like Parks and Rec, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Good Place, Schitt's Creek, and Superstore. It's like 95% good vibes. I had only seen clips of it and I was a bit concerned the humor wasn't going to land for me. That was partially true. I didn't find it uproariously funny, but I found it humorous and had some good laughs. I found the ratio of story/drama to comedy similar to The Good Place, which totally works for me. On a personal note, I never really like Jason Sudeikis all that much, but I enjoy him much more as a relatable character than his normal kind-of-a-dick roles."
You Are Beautiful,Finished **The Americans** Season 1 and I understand the hype now. The quality already feels like Breaking Bad/The Sopranos tier. Just great writing/directing/acting across the board.
You Are Beautiful,"* Wednesday - Netflix
* Picard S3 - Amazon Prime
* Bleach (anime) - Disney+
* Black Clover (anime) - Various
* Vinland Saga (anime) - Netflix"
You Are Beautiful,"- Swarm (Amazon). I really like it so far. Funny and Dark
- Perry Mason
- BMF"
You Are Beautiful,Someone tell me how Extrapolations is
You Are Beautiful,"Currently watching

The Leftovers- having seen this recommended many times on here I finally gave it a shot. Through episode 3 so far with the last episode being the best. Honestly if I hadn’t read so many comments about how good this show is I’d give up. So far it’s extremely bleak and all the characters I could care less about. I’m hopeful that will change.

Abbot Elementary - up to date on the show. I find episodes hit or miss. It’s a quick show however and a nice cleanse after a leftovers episode.

Welcome to Wrexham- just generally enjoyable to watch. Reynolds and McElHenney are just comedy together.

Derry Girls - 2 episodes left and I’ll be caught up. Love this show! Great comedy and cast. Definitely a recommend for anyone looking for a good short comedy.

Finished

Last of Us - loved this series. Felt at times it was rushed and could have really benefited from going to 10 epsiodes and building more with Joel and Ellie especially after episode 8. And was surprised how few scenes included Infected, especially in the back half.  Episode 1 and 3 are probably 2 of my favorite episodes of television ever.

Mad Men S6 - while still a great show I found season 6 to be not as enjoyable as previous seasons with less highs than the others. 

What We Do in the Shadows - every episode is good for some great laughs. Nandor is my MVP of the latest episode"
You Are Beautiful,"Watching s2 of Ted Lasso and I love it. While watching the Emmys last year, without having seen s2 of Ted Lasso, I thought it was sacrilegious that Barry s3 lost to it. However, now that I've seen most of it, I can see why it won. I still think s3 of Barry is better, but this show/season is great without a doubt."
You Are Beautiful,"Droppin a show in surprised I've never seen mentioned here before. 

Mr. Mercedes.. has many things in common with a lot of the shows ppl mention here.

Its based on Stephen king material.

First season is very much a very good crime drama but as it goes on shit gets very weird.  It is king after all.. but very good crime / thriller with sci fi elements that play our later.

Think it was originally on peacock and no idea where to find if now other than the skull and crossbones route.

Either way pretty interesting show. Great cast . With enough wtf weird shit to keep you interested.

A bit like You + mr robot + any good detective show.

Cast is kinda low key but some excellent work gets done. Especially Brendan Gleeson"
You Are Beautiful,Absolutely loving Daisy Jones & The Six atm
You Are Beautiful,"Ok so I haven't seen any new 2023 series yet, but the releases so far are looking very promising. **These are what I have on my to-watch list**:

* Swarm (Amazon Prime)
* Django
* Class of 07
* The Last of Us
* Bad Behaviour
* Eva Lasting
* The Girl and the Astronaut
* The Pimp — No Fucking Fairytale
* Not Even
* Poker Face
* Liaison
* You & Me
* The Gold
* The Head of Joaquín Murrieta 
* Hasta el cielo: La serie
* The Roar of the Butterflies

Have anyone seen any of these (*besides the obvious). And or there any new 2023 shows that you'd recommend I add?"
You Are Beautiful,"The Stand 1994 or 2020, which one to watch?"
You Are Beautiful,"Just finished **The Consultant** on Amazon Prime.  Was very honestly sincerely surprised to see that it was based on a Bentley Little book; tried to get into him when he first started out and his writing was such an obvious and transparent aping of Stephen King's style that I gave up after two books:  ""The Town"" which had a boy jerking off in his sister's panties, and ""The Store"" which had a father fucking his daughter, and both with abrupt shitty endings, just like King.  I was so sure that by episode 3 we'd discover that Mama Sang while her Baby Yodeled down there, but fortunately the source material didn't seem to go that direction -- but the ending still sucked and was abrupt.  I honestly don't know why I voluntarily finished a show adapted from a third-tier King wannabe, but I'm glad to confirm and validate my previous criticisms of the author.

Also, in episode 4, the soundtrack that played during the timelapse of Waltz in the waiting area sounded so very suspiciously similar to [this bop by 9 Lazy 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jrn-kwtEhUg) that I had to pause and look up the music credits.  Didn't see them listed, so it's either an oversight or the ""original music composer"" thought they could get away with a little motif plagiarism."
You Are Beautiful,"This week I have watched:

**Dark Winds** - what brought me to this series was, of course, Zahn McClarnon and I did enjoy his acting and a detective story on ass end of nowhere in Indian reservation seemed like a fascinating idea, but overall the series was all over the place. It seems like they had concepts for 5 seasons but decided to smash it all into one series of 6 episodes. Overall it was very cluttered and increasingly ridiculous. It also had some themes that seemed important, like native beliefs - especially around witchcraft, that went completely nowhere. Most egregious example of this is the character of the witch who, for no clear reason, was aligned with the bandits and she did not even have a single sentence to speak. Overall, at best it was mediocre. If it returns in S2 I will give it a chance, but if writers don't improve I will drop it.

**The Devil's Hour** - fascinating, weird and really fucking dark mini series with Peter Capaldi as a serial killer. It really stuck my vibe. Definitely recommend.

**The Consultant** - after learning that the show has Christoph Waltz as one of main characters I expected much more from it. I don't know the book it adapts so cannot comment on how faithful it is, but the show seemed very confused about its own story and did not seem to know what to do. They set up the mystery of Regus Patoff but did not really pursue it in any meaningful way and did not resolve it, they set up the theme of his corrupting influence and ruthless corporate politics but barely showed anything, they went for some themes of company doing illegal shit but never went anywhere with it or showed any consequences for those actions. Overall, I was disappointed."
You Are Beautiful,Started OUTLAST on Netflix and wound up cranking through it in one day. A survival competition where people need to survive each other. Kind of shows the best and worst of human nature.
You Are Beautiful,I haven't seen it mentioned on Reddit at all but there is a new Canadian series called *Shelved*. It's a bit like Superstore but it's the employees at a Library. It's only 2 episodes in so far but I've enjoyed them and think it has a lot of potential.
You Are Beautiful,"Just finished **The Legend of Korra** and it was pretty good. It had higher highs than the original **Avatar** but lower lows and lower mediums. Of all the widely beloved shows this more than most lends itself to a relaunch and adding more seasons. Simply a new Avatar is born and take it from there. Wonder why there are no new seasons given how popular the show is and how obsessed studios are with relaunching very popular ip.

Watched season one of **Vinland Saga** and it was great. Season two is so much worse. I feel cheated."
You Are Beautiful,"Any recs for a new show for my wife and I?

Most recently we’ve watched:
The Morning Show
Curb Your Enthusiasm
Shameless (a rewatch for her)
Barry
Ozark (final season, watched all basically as it would get released.)

She watches way more TV than I do, it’s less my go-to medium, but I do like having something in rotation for us to share. She enjoys a lot of reality TV and the dramas or thrillers on Netflix. I’m open to those shows, but typically don’t gravitate towards them on my own. She prefers live action and contemporary, nothing really sci-fi or fantasy.

EDIT: Also looking to avoid anything with significant cancer storylines right now.

We have Netflix, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Disney+ currently.

Anything based on some of this info would be greatly appreciated!!"
You Are Beautiful,Swarm only seen 4 out of 7 so far but there's been some great guest stars.
You Are Beautiful,[deleted]
You Are Beautiful,"Highly recommend SCHOOL SPIRITS on paramount, not seeing it mentioned enough around here."
You Are Beautiful,"While I like the new Quantum Leap, we've absolutely loved a similar show that was just put up on Amazon Prime:   The Pretender.   

It's an older 90s show, and super formulaic.  But man is it FUN and uplifting to watch.    Very similar to Quantum Leap in that it's a brand new situation every week, but still has a continuing background origin story.  It's really well done, and good seeing bad people brought to justice for once :P"
You Are Beautiful,Swarm on Amazon is WILD & so good.
You Are Beautiful,My girlfriend and I are on season 2 of Doom Patrol. it's a pretty fun and entertaining show even though we both frequently wonder what the heck is going on.  Sometimes we think that's the point. Definitely one of the better DC Comics shows!
You Are Beautiful,Writers strike might be coming so we might have nothing to watch soon and can catch up on older series or do rewatch.
The Irregular at Magic High School,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
The Irregular at Magic High School,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"""Adulting"""
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
The Irregular at Magic High School,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
The Irregular at Magic High School,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
The Irregular at Magic High School,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
The Irregular at Magic High School,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
The Irregular at Magic High School,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
The Irregular at Magic High School,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
The Irregular at Magic High School,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
The Irregular at Magic High School,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
The Irregular at Magic High School,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
The Irregular at Magic High School,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
The Irregular at Magic High School,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
The Irregular at Magic High School,as a nonactor me too.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
The Irregular at Magic High School,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
The Irregular at Magic High School,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
The Irregular at Magic High School,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
The Irregular at Magic High School,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
The Irregular at Magic High School,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
The Irregular at Magic High School,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
The Irregular at Magic High School,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
The Irregular at Magic High School,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
The Irregular at Magic High School,This whole sub has just become ads lol
The Irregular at Magic High School,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
The Irregular at Magic High School,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
The Irregular at Magic High School,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
The Irregular at Magic High School,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
The Irregular at Magic High School,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
The Irregular at Magic High School,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."
The Irregular at Magic High School,Drake Bell doesn't care for an adult version.
The Irregular at Magic High School,You forgot *Hey Dude*
The Irregular at Magic High School,Definitely ready for that word to die.
The Irregular at Magic High School,yippee yippee yeehaw!!!
The Irregular at Magic High School,"And they always mean incredibly basic things like doing laundry and paying bills. Never the tough things like fighting with the insurance company to cover cancer treatment, trying to get speech therapy for your kid, or caring for a disabled parent."
The Irregular at Magic High School,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
The Irregular at Magic High School,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
The Irregular at Magic High School,I’m glad someone said it.
The Irregular at Magic High School,Coconut Head?
The Irregular at Magic High School,Who?
The Irregular at Magic High School,posting this and not saying the name?
The Irregular at Magic High School,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
The Irregular at Magic High School,The Internet is ads
The Irregular at Magic High School,Always was
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Well, what else is there to do here ?

I prefer those ads over people bootlicking Netflix execs."
The Irregular at Magic High School,This is a podcast about adult life not a rewatch podcast but agreed
The Irregular at Magic High School,The short lived Aliens in America too.
The Irregular at Magic High School,She also made one of my favorite games of all time: Enslaved. Great part alongside Andy Serkins.
The Irregular at Magic High School,She was also in Suburgatory for a few episodes
The Irregular at Magic High School,She also did a great performance as Trip in the video game Enslaved. Did motion capture for it and everything.
The Irregular at Magic High School,She had a role in the Twilight movies as well.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Such a shame. It feels like a no brainer for new content, but I guess Nick doesn't feel the same way."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Something about it just grinds my gears. It's like internet speak to me, I'd react the same way if someone actually said LOL in real life."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Wish I Was Here was a solid movie, but I don't know why I needed to fund it."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"This is where the minor celebrity comes in. If he can come up with a pitchable product like a movie, he can try doing a Kickstarter and use his fame to promote the Kickstarter."
The Irregular at Magic High School,100%...i need to binge this show eventually. I'm currently watching 3 long as shows right now though...
The Irregular at Magic High School,"The internet is for ads  
The Internet is for ads  
Why’d you think the Net was had?  
Ads, ads, ads"
The Irregular at Magic High School,Am..I an ad???
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Lmao what do you mean ""she made?"" She isn't a game dev lol"
The Irregular at Magic High School,I really don’t understand why not. Just put it on Paramount+. The iCarly reboot seemed to get a decent amount of buzz.
The Irregular at Magic High School,To me it's the idea that being an adult is like being at a job. Something that's inconvenient but you have to do it to live. No you are an adult 24/7 start acting like it
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Yeah, but even that's a stretch. 

Devon hasn't acted in much of anything in years, so having a crowd-funded project would be much harder for him than it was for Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels."
The Irregular at Magic High School,ok work avenue q
The Irregular at Magic High School,">	Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels.

God, I’m so excited about that kickstarter. I backed at the highest tier and am waiting on my first delivery."
The Irregular at Magic High School,I'm not convinced that Sanderson is actually human. I'm pretty sure that he--and John Ringo for that matter--are robots who write and do not sleep.
The Irregular at Magic High School,Adrian Tchaikovsky too.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"RIP Joanna Cole

Frizzle and the gang got child-me to love and into sciences and space. The imagination ran wild! Take chances, make mistakes, get messy! Beep beep"
The Irregular at Magic High School,Getting that scholastic book fair poster buying nostalgia.
The Irregular at Magic High School,"I hope the live-action lives up to Joanna Cole's expectations, even though she won't get to see it. What a dream, to write something that will live on long after your gone."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"I was a bit too old for the show when it aired, but I loved the books as a kid. Sad to see. Especially coming so close on the heals to Tomie Depaola's passing."
The Irregular at Magic High School,[deleted]
The Irregular at Magic High School,"Joanna Cole also wrote the books ""Im a Big Brother/Sister"" that was super useful for making my oldest child feel good about the birth of my youngest.

RIP and thanks."
The Irregular at Magic High School,NOT THE OG RICK AND MORTY!!!
The Irregular at Magic High School,"the black girl on magic school bus showed me i could excel in the sciences. 

that little bit of role modeling, even as a cartoon, was enough of a little door opening to allow me to do all i’ve done. 

rip joanna cole, and thank you."
Blue Exorcist,How many of these subreddits will be dead in a year? r/KevinCanWait
Blue Exorcist,I'm excited for the Good Place. NBC might have a decent comedy again.
Blue Exorcist,"Shows I'm most looking forward to are The Exorcist, Designated Survivor, and Falling Water. Designated Survivor has surprised me with its positive reviews, plus I'm a fan of Kiefer Sutherland. Falling Water seems like an interesting concept, though maybe a bit too ambitious."
Blue Exorcist,"Looking forward to black-ish, HTGAWM, This is Us and Netflix's Easy."
Blue Exorcist,"I'm looking forward to the return of Lucifer and The Blacklist.

I'm anxious to check out This Is Us. I'll give MacGyver a chance.

But I have to admit, it's been years since I've been excited for the premiere of a network show. Right now, I'm counting down the sleeps until Luke Cage. No network show inspires that kind of anticipation within me."
Blue Exorcist,That's a lot of shows in a week. College me would have been ecstatic.
Blue Exorcist,Super hyped for both Survivor's
Blue Exorcist,"I suppose this is nice: but the trouble with being US-centric:

Red Dwarf starts a new series (Series XI) on Thursday 22nd on Dave (UK TV Channel)

Surely there's no more important information than this?!"
Blue Exorcist,"None of the new stuff excites me, although I have seen the first episode of Van Helsing and it was ok. I am really looking forward to the new season of Longmire."
Blue Exorcist,"Returning shows I am looking forward to are B99, The Goldbergs, The Real O'Neals, The Blacklist, Last Man Standing(mostly background noise), Superstore.

Given up on The Middle, New Girl (expect the crossover with B99)

New shows I will give The Good Place a shot. "
Blue Exorcist,i still need to catch up on so many of these
Blue Exorcist,"""This is us"" looks abso-fucking-lutely terrible. "
Blue Exorcist,"Dont see anyone talking about StartUp, the new show on Crackle with Martin Freeman, think it came out about a week ago. Been watching it for a bit its worth checking out."
Blue Exorcist,"I am going to be watching  
Lucifer (campy, but fun), Brooklyn Nine Nine (NEIN NEIN!), Designated Survivor, How to Get Away With Murder (this is the social show I'm watching, everyone else I know is watching it), The Exorcist, Dr. Ken, and Poldark (surprisingly excited for this one)."
Blue Exorcist,"Ooh, Falling Water seems pretty interesting."
Blue Exorcist,Wait I thought Falling Water was starting in October?
Blue Exorcist,"Cant wait for Gotham, Agents of SHIELD and TBBT"
Blue Exorcist,Thank you for this post.  It is great to have all this info in one place.
Blue Exorcist,Excited to see ghost rider in agents of shield
Blue Exorcist,"Big bang, Gotham, AoS, brooklyn 99 , family guy and Simpsons are all i watch here. 

Any of the new shows seem like someone that enjoys the above shows would be into?"
Blue Exorcist,"holy shit I thought bull looked horrific from the first trailer I saw, but it's based on dr phil.... wow awful"
Blue Exorcist,More Gotham tomorrow! Whoooo!
Blue Exorcist,"I will try to get something a bit flashier than the Reddit default design up on **/r/TheGoodPlace** before the premiere tonight, but we will will definitely be having an episode discussion thread over there if anyone interested in the series wants to join in."
Blue Exorcist,"Episode 1 of the Exorcist was fantastic, at least for me. Waaayyyy better than I expected."
Blue Exorcist,Was Lucifer good? I remember reading that it was a police procedural so never checked it out last year.
Blue Exorcist,"Premise seemed really terrible this time around, but that whole ""evac"" tease really lured me in.

Seriously tho, this ""Gen X vs Millenials"" concept is worse than the 4 race tribes season imo."
Blue Exorcist,So excited!
Blue Exorcist,"Allow me to paraphrase a quote from Red Dwarf to express my opinion on the continuing viability of Red Dwarf series: It's dead, Dave."
Blue Exorcist,I think it's so funny that people now have to apologize or qualify when they say they like Last Man Standing. What's so wrong about liking a straightforward feel-good family sitcom? I know it's not going to win any awards (for writing or acting) but it's totally enjoyable to watch. 
Blue Exorcist,"I only watch Last Man Standing if my parents have it on and I happen to be in the same room, but honestly, I find it surprisingly enjoyable. I don't really agree with the conservative-ness of some of the characters, but there's some decent debate that happens, and the jokes around it tend to actually be funny."
Blue Exorcist,"Watched the pilot. Definitely couldn't see myself watching any more.
"
Blue Exorcist,"I had no idea Gotham was starting this week as well, I thought it was just Agents of SHIELD. I feel like that just flew under the radar for me."
Blue Exorcist,"Oh, cool! Everyone was all ""what a terrible idea!"" but I thought the story could work as a show. The movie has such a slow buildup, seems like it'd work fine as a tv show. And now that I know *Geena Davis* is in it, and one person said it's good, I might check it out. [That sentence wasn't being sarcastic, you're actually the only review I've seen for it. One person saying it's good is better than no people saying anything.]"
Blue Exorcist,Is it supposed to be a horror show?
Blue Exorcist,"From the procedural standpoint, it's pretty terrible. What really sells the series is just how good Tom Ellis is as Lucifer. He's just so fun to watch that it makes up for everything else. "
Blue Exorcist,No it wasn't.
Blue Exorcist,It was ok. 
Blue Exorcist,"I would have agreed with you after Red Dwarf VIII, and especially agreed with you after the monstrosity that was ""Red Dwarf IX"" (Back to Earth).... but Red Dwarf X from 2012 was an absolute return to form. Maybe not 100% hey-day Red Dwarf but a good 90%. Those six episodes were really quite good!

So if Red Dwarf XI is ANYTHING like X (and the odd report from studio filming a while back) then ""The boys are back in the Dwarf"" 

My body is ready.... Wait, just let me check: thermos, sandwiches, corn plasters, telephone money, dandruff brush, animal footprint chart, and one triple thick condom! You never know!"
Blue Exorcist,"The Exorcist is a half hour single-camera sitcom; it's like Scrubs, but with priests and demons."
Blue Exorcist,"Tom Ellis in this role is one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a long time. It's like the man was born for the part. He has the perfect looks, perfect accent, perfect everything.

Even more interesting, it isn't even his native accent (he's Welsh, the character has a British accent). Since then I've seen him play characters with American accents too. The man is quite good.

The show does have some weak aspects, but so far Ellis more than made up for them. And he's in almost every scene."
Blue Exorcist,Agreed. The weekly cases are awful. Half the cast are nearly unbearable to watch. But Tom Ellis is a riot in this role. I'm hoping beyond hope this season is so much better. 
Blue Exorcist,"There's something about Welsh actors with English accents that make great TV. Another procedural show I was disappointed about getting cancelled was Forever, that show would have really benefitted from a second season, Ioan Gruffudd was really good."
Blue Exorcist,Tom Ellis as Lucifer is the only thing that made me OK with Rush's premature cancellation with such a huge cliffhanger. He's really quite perfect.
Blue Exorcist,"Forever was pretty damn good, I don't understand how shows like that get cancelled and the 8th copy of CSI are on their 5th season or so."
Blue Exorcist,"I loved Forever! I was so upset when I found out that it was canceled.  I'm loving Lucifer too!  Tom Ellis is perfect!  I hope they keep it around for a while,  I just love to see what new things he gets up to! "
Blue Exorcist,"It was such an interesting concept too, and the interactions between Hirsch and Gruffudd was so unique to TV, having someone so much younger act as both the youth and the elder while Hirsch had to play both the son and old man. "
Blue Exorcist,I almost puked when I first saw a commercial spot for a Rush Hour TV show. I see most of America agreed as it got cancelled reaaaal quick.
Blue Exorcist,"I don't see how it could be too many... networks are constantly setting records every year in terms of number of original hours of programming, so there's just a lot more TV in general. Plenty of great original ideas, plenty of bad ones too. Similar to your list, some of those shows are bad, some are great. Westworld, for instance, is one of the best shows of the year."
Blue Exorcist,"I can speak for The Exorcist, Westworld and Ash vs. Evil Dead being the excellent."
Blue Exorcist,"Teen Wolf was good for the first few seasons, then they killed off the main female lead, replaced her with a new character they didn't know what to do with, and it started going downhill.


But Limitless isn't on this list, and that show was incredible. Even had Cooper reprise his role as Morra. Sucks that CBS cancelled it, it was their best new show when it was on air."
Blue Exorcist,"The Lethal Weapon show is actually alright.. The chemistry between the main cast is good, the script is fairly well written, it kind of captures the spirit of the movies while also standing on its own 2 feet"
Blue Exorcist,"There are over 400 scripted shows in 2016. This includes the networks, premium channels and streaming services. 

It doesn't surprise me there are a number based on movies. If the show is good that is a good thing. MASH and Buffy the vampire slayer were orders of magnitude better than the movies they were based on.  "
Blue Exorcist,"I have only selected those from 2010 onwards, including some recently cancelled/ended. There seem to be a lot, and it's all across the networks.

That doesn't include film tie-in shows such as Marvel (of which there are also many...) or animated shows. It seems like ideas have dried up."
Blue Exorcist,Thank god you didn't make the stupid mistake of putting Hannibal on here.
Blue Exorcist,"There are films with truncated story development better suited to a series, and series stretchng plot material better suited to a film. The best film to series transformations explain, enhance, complete, and/or reframe the original story. The worst take the original characters and premise and get lost in unrelated, even contradictory plot lines. Too many film-based shows? No. Just too many film-based shows from the second category."
Blue Exorcist,"You left out Fargo. Arguably better than every one you listed, although Westworld ia probably about even. Haven't seen it yet (I will soon) so I won't judge on that one."
Blue Exorcist,"What killed it is mtv, it had so much potential but the writing and music is awful. Specially the ""music from"" part."
From Dusk Till Dawn,I didn't know that this series existed.  I'll check it out.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"> The series adaptation of the Tarantino classic From Dusk Till Dawn will depart Netflix globally in November 2022 unless a new deal is struck to save it.


> The series is a Netflix Original title in most regions outside of the United States, with Netflix being the only place to watch the show via streaming (some broadcast deals were struck elsewhere).


> Netflix first picked up the show in August 2014, with each new season added shortly after its air date. The final season of From Dusk Till Dawn arrived in the summer of 2016 for those outside the US and in December 2016 in the US...

> As we’ve covered for quite some time, the list of Netflix Originals leaving the service is ballooning, with co-productions and exclusive distribution deals coming to an end."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Netflix is losing a lot of content next month. Here are a few things also leaving

Naruto

Goosebumps

Lilyhammer

Knight Rider

Stargate

It seems like every month the Netflix catalog is getting smaller and smaller."
From Dusk Till Dawn,I loved the film so much.  Didn't get very far into the show.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Annnnnd I just went and bought the blu rays. Blind buy yolo.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"While there is still time you should binge this.  Not without its flaws for sure but defiantly worth a watch.  

Another great show off of Netflix...no doubt to make room for more original programing that 

A.  No one will watch 

B.  People will watch and want it to continue but it will get canceled anyway."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"I wonder if it will pop up on tubi, crackle or plex next? That's what so many shows are going to."
From Dusk Till Dawn,That’s good right? I watched half of the first episode and thought wow these lazy idiots really did stretch this movie out into a whole series. What a bunch of lazy hacks.
From Dusk Till Dawn,This show is so so so so so good and fun. This stings.
From Dusk Till Dawn,I remember when this was an original series on the now defunct El Rey Network.
From Dusk Till Dawn,This crap is on Netflix?
From Dusk Till Dawn,Go in with low expectations and it's enjoyable
From Dusk Till Dawn,Worth watching just for Eiza.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Had no clue either.
From Dusk Till Dawn,If the first episode is anything to go on it is utter trash.
From Dusk Till Dawn,I knew it existed but never knew it was on netflixv
From Dusk Till Dawn,"And Leon is getting laaaaaarrrrrgggggggeeerrrr!

/sorry. couldn't resist."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"I started a game where I rewatch Stargate until it gets taken off it's streaming platform and restart whenever it gets added on to a new one. 

Seems it's time to restart it for like the sixth time lol."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Naruto Shippuden or just Naruto? I need finish Shippuden.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Y'all had Knight Rider? Y'all had Stargate? 

Huh..."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Seems like it, but maybe not. Stuff gets taken off all the time, but stuff also gets added all the time. I've lost track of how many times things like Stargate or the TMNT movies have come and gone."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"> It seems like every month the Netflix catalog is getting smaller and smaller.

It's just a game of musical content chairs. They ""lose"" these and bring in others."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"If they Cancel Sandman and/or Barbarians, im cancelling netflix. 

Honestly, not every show needs to knock it out of the park the first few weeks. Lots of shows develop followings when word of mouth is good over a long period of time. 

Part of keeping subscribers is having a deep viewing platform of good shows that people can watch after the popular one is finsished. If your platform has a bunch of cancelled shows with no endings its just going to piss everyone off and they wont stay subbed.

I really dont understand why netflix doesnt get this."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Yeah because it’s a show Netflix probably see little viewers in and isn’t worth renewing the license free. 

Someone else will lay Pennie’s for this"
From Dusk Till Dawn,It's definitely cringe. Best thing about Netflix is being able to speed shows up to 1.5 speed.
From Dusk Till Dawn,That’s how I first found out about Eiza many years ago. Her naked scenes were something else lol.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"It has its moments.  The end of season one and season two are actually pretty good.  Campy and over the top, the world building is actually pretty interesting.

A good binge popcorn show."
From Dusk Till Dawn,A+ reference.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Why… it looks like a big Tylenol
From Dusk Till Dawn,[Whoopsy](https://media3.giphy.com/media/pmgkCpOpwCQ6c/giphy.gif?cid=5e2148865a7b4pqlos51yz4xpb56kiqxvgk25k9i6ywx3g1h&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Give it 3 more years before Disney, Viacom, Paramount and Sony gobble up the remaining IPs and are forced to sign a *peace treaty* and give us cable again. Until then it's a roulette wheel or the bleed us all dry"
From Dusk Till Dawn,Just go on narutoget.tv
From Dusk Till Dawn,"how many iteration does he need for this?
already have a movie & tv series with the same story."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Jeez, Robert. Let it go, live in the now."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Add an animated Selma Hayek and I’m in.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"I actually really enjoyed the series, I was disappointed when it became clear it wasn't going to continue. Not even proper closure with a cancellation IIRC, just 'actors released from contracts' or something. I certainly don't think it was a great show, but it had very good looking men and women to perve on and was fun in a stupid sort of way. The sort of show I'd wait until the end of the season and then binge, since I didn't need to watch it week by week."
From Dusk Till Dawn,But why
From Dusk Till Dawn,Animated toe scenes too?
From Dusk Till Dawn,I mean who’s asking for this
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Snowball's chance in hell of happening I think, but I'd love to see Madhouse take a stab at this. It feels rather unnecessary, but their style that I can really only describe as professionally rough around the edges feels like the proper visual tone for this franchise. Plus, [QT already showed the world that studio is amazing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHnVsjBoHnY)"
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Fan of the film for its grind house cheese, but the live action television series was absolutely terrible. Hopefully this is better."
From Dusk Till Dawn,is it a good show? im trying to get into to it.
From Dusk Till Dawn,The saving grace of the show after the first season was how attractive the cast was. If they do the animation style in a cool way maybe this would be something I would check out.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"So he thinking a continuation of the show, or a full reboot ala Battlestar?"
From Dusk Till Dawn,I can’t wait to rub one out to cartoon Hayek
From Dusk Till Dawn,"It has been a full court press from Rodriquez's marketing team lately.

What does he need to find more investor money after the Alita debacle?"
From Dusk Till Dawn,"I love the first movie, but PAAAAASS."
From Dusk Till Dawn,I’d love to see some Castlevania collaboration.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Terrible movie. Remarkably so IMO
From Dusk Till Dawn,"When the vampires came out, the film failed"
From Dusk Till Dawn,"For those who never heard of this, From Dusk Till Dawn was a terrible duo of vampire movies made from the same man who made Django.
 
It had senseless violence, blood and gore, and more sexual references than you could shake a stick at.  

Basically if they were to make it in the style of classic anime than it will be an instant cult classic."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Please stop.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Narrator: ""Rated peegee thurrrteen."""
From Dusk Till Dawn,Yes please!!
From Dusk Till Dawn,I love the garbage that Robert makes. It’s Adam Sandler levels of “Let’s just get a bunch of friends and fuck around and make some dumb shit then sell it”
From Dusk Till Dawn,"“Touch my brother with that steak, biker, and vampires won’t have to suck your blood, they’ll be able to lick it up off of the floor!”"
From Dusk Till Dawn,Salma's body was absurd
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Loved the movie, not the sequels, skipped the show with Fez, but I would watch this. They should get H. Jon Benjamin for Clooney."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Hey!  This would be great new content for the El Rey Netwo.....oh.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Animated.....great....
From Dusk Till Dawn,Why?
From Dusk Till Dawn,Animated salma hayek foot stuff. Tarantino will be pleased
From Dusk Till Dawn,Beating the fuck out of that dead horse.  Someone call the SPCA!
From Dusk Till Dawn,And the there was already a sequel and prequel to the original before that
From Dusk Till Dawn,It will take as many casting calls for Salma Hayek foot model look alikes as is needed.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"> how many iteration does he need for this?

If there's money to be made..."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"He needs a version for the kids.

The spy kids franchise has died out"
From Dusk Till Dawn,He won’t stop till it’s on Broadway
From Dusk Till Dawn,But animation allows to do stuff you can't do in live production given the cost. I think it might be pretty good idea as they can go absolutely nuts in that form and that's something i'm into.
From Dusk Till Dawn,yea what ever happened to that tv series.
From Dusk Till Dawn,a HQ detailed 24 hand drawn frame per second scene of Salma Hayek's foot in Tarantino's mouth.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Anime tiddies
From Dusk Till Dawn,I agree alltough the series turned out weird when the vampires wherent vampires but snake people and you had a mexican Van Hellsing or that's where i stoped watching it.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"As I recall from bingeing it, the live action show was completely on par with other supernatural shows on TV that have received a ton of aplomb. It's more consistent that Wynonna Earp and some nut jobs gave that a bunch of best of awards. Even if the first season is just the movie extended to a season."
From Dusk Till Dawn,yeah but I still watched it allllll lol
From Dusk Till Dawn,Eiza Gonzales made at least the first season worthwhile. She is one of the few women who can match Salma Hayek from the time
From Dusk Till Dawn,I liked it at first but then somewhere it starts getting really weird. Not just from duck till dawn weird completely  bonkers storylines.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Season 1: Dusk til Dawn the movie

Seasons 2+: bonkers run of the mill supernatural tv show based on dusk til dawn"
From Dusk Till Dawn,The movie is way better.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Seth Gecko was part of the Belmont clan all along
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Woah there’s a prequel? I assume it’s not what I want though.

Every time I watch that movie(maybe once a year if I can find someone who has never seen it because reactions to the twist are so funny) I am just distraught that the first half wasn’t what the movie was about. It feels like we had a Tarantino classic get derailed and we’ll never really know what could have been."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Was the prequel called From Dawn Til Dusk?
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Texas Blood Money and Hangman's daughter respectively, the movies that taught my not to trust something just because QT and RR put their names on them."
From Dusk Till Dawn,"And Quentin will personally inspect every foot lookalike to ensure the most perfect of matches 

God, I thought Tarantino’s foot fetish was an overblown joke before I watched that movie."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Funny thing is that none of them really made money.
From Dusk Till Dawn,Quentin Tarantino has joined the chat.
From Dusk Till Dawn,I could maybe do it rotoscoped but it wouldn't be amazing.
From Dusk Till Dawn,So for I lol I actually thought the third season was finally finding it's own voice and was the best. It ended on a high note for me. Still not good television though.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"The prequel is basically the same movie but set in the 1800’s, a bunch of outlaw cowboys hide out at a saloon built on the same temple and vampires attack. And they sequel didn’t have the temple at all, it was just a bank heist and vampires attack. They’re both pretty bad, but Danny Trejo is in both"
From Dusk Till Dawn,"I know, up until they get to the Mexican Bar it seems like this suspenseful crime thriller.  Two fugitives, one of which is more or less a rapist deluded psychopath, kidnap a family in an RV in a desperate attempt to make it across the border.  I guess the vampire stuff gives them a reason to form a shaky alliance.  Such a weird movie, but I loved it as a kid.  Plus Tom Savini"
From Dusk Till Dawn,Lol nah it was just from Dusk Til Dawn 3
From Dusk Till Dawn,The first film was successful and I assume the rest of it must have been somewhat profitable or else they wouldn't keep milking it.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"That’s funny because I just saw Tremors 4 and it essentially did the same thing, a copy of the first movie but in the wild west"
From Dusk Till Dawn,"I remember enjoying the sequel with Robert Patrick.  It was DTV, and had no involvement from Tarantino and Rodridguez (as far as I know) so certainly wasn't expecting much so was nicely surprised.  I heard The Hangman's Daughter was terrible though."
From Dusk Till Dawn,Loved it also as a kid but salma hayek in a bikini was what i cared about.
From Dusk Till Dawn,"Believe it or not, the first film only made 25mm on a 19mm budget (not including 20mm + in marketing). I think it only made its money back on home video after it became a cult classic?"
From Dusk Till Dawn,I liked hangman’s daughter more
From Dusk Till Dawn,"According to Wikipedia it made 59.3 million.

Not sure if that's correct, but my personal totally anecdotal recollection is that it was quite popular also before it hit home video. I saw it in a packed cinema with three friends."
From Dusk Till Dawn,No offense but mm are for millimeters god damn it
From Dusk Till Dawn,Interesting. According to The Numbers and BOM it made 25mm domestic and only a few thousand international. Maybe Wikipedia took into account home video?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"So, Daredevil, Jessica Jones then?"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I mean, it's not like he's writing it.

All this talk about how bold the show is just reminds me how much I liked WandaVision at the start and how much it ultimately let me down when it became just another Marvel thing."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,The first Iron Man is the best Marvel movie.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Spider-man, Falcon & The Winter Soldier, and Loki, were all good character studies, probably even more so than Iron Man. We watched those characters get broken down and delved into who they are and why they do what they do.

I'm excited for Moon Knight, but credit where it's due."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Wait, do people generally not like Wandavision? This thread is throwing me, I thought it was some of the best Marvel stuff period"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,This is a nice sentiment but Marvel has had several legitimate character studies since Iron Man.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I’d argue the best character study is Nebula.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"He sounds like Lady Gaga talking about her ""Beyond Amazing""  performance in the stupid movie she was campaigning for the Oscars for."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,###Whatever. Just make sure it’s enjoyable.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Is that really what iron man is? It's almost pure action. 

The closest thing in the MCU to a character study has got to be Daredevil."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I’m really excited for Moon Knight. All the stars are lining up to make it a success!
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Logan?

Edit: Not MCU"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Character(s) study.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Dissing about 25 movies here lol
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"\*please be good, please be good\*"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I can't take his 'character study' seriously with his SNL tier english accent.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Idk that sounds kinda douchey of him to say, imo."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Uh, Oscar....did you watch Daredevil? Just sayin'."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I don’t care, big Hollywood simply cannot make Moon Knight without ruining it. Moon Knight is a deep cut, and particularly dark, darker than the target-audience fuckers are willing to go. They’ll shred the original concept and inject it with mainstream media ideals, or water it down in an attempt to make it epic because it’s all about return on investment 

I think Tim Burton or David Fincher, someone like that could have done it. But everyone and everything now worships formulas that only work for the casual audience unfortunately. There is no casual audience for Moon Knight"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Ok I’m over him.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,What is the character study of Ironman? Guy realizes that creating defense weapons might actually be bad?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,What does he mean character study?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Moon knight is batman but without the money. there goes your character study.

Edit: come on guys! I know they are not the same. didn't think I had to add /s"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Fuck Disney for getting all of marvel off Netflix
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,So? I want a solid gold toilet.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,So… he didn’t watch WandaVision’s extended character study on grief and trauma processing?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Great character for it tho id prefer punisher to be that character study in the same manner that ennis explored it, during the quiet moments exploring his nightmares and monologues"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"That’s great, but uhhhhhh… where’s dracula?

And most importantly, uhhh, where’s my ketamine?"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Instead he made Moon Knight.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I'm tired of seeing him in so many things recently. Aren't there more actors out there for hollywood to use?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Want to see action, not a “character study”. Hope it delivers"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"lol,Iron Man was no character study buddy. And I love the movie,even think it was the superior comic book movie that year(yeah,I think Iron Man is better then TDK)."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I wonder if he also wants to run it into the fucking ground as well. 

Downvote me all you want marvel freaks. One day you’re gonna realize that there really can be too much of a “good” thing."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,So we're going to ignore everything prior films and TV did? What a needlessly combative claim.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Everyone of you forgetting Luke Cage are dumb.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Great. Can he shoot Metal Gear Solid next? It’s all I care about.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Getting the hip boots on for this one.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,He looks like the byproduct of Mel Gibson and Henry Cavill making a baby
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,What about Edward Norton's Hulk?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"He Does know it’s a comic book, right?"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I'm sorry but I cannot seriously believe that Disney allowed a ""Legitimate character study"" of a character like moon knight, a really obscure character."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Sooo his role in dune where where
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Can’t wait for moon afternoon.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I honestly think Thor’s arc is a legitimate character study.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,NO ONES EVER HEARD A MACHINE GUN KELLY SONG BOB
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"That is what made Iron Man so good imo.  It wasn't just a super hero story, it was much deeper."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Looks a little too fever dreamy for my taste.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Don't do Jessica Jones like that. 😩 Jessica, Killgrave, and Jerri were all fascinating characters. To a lesser degree I even found Malcolm and Trish really interesting even though all the other fans hated Trish."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Somehow Thanos returned
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Marvel don’t count those ..
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Say what you will about the Netflix shows... everyone got humanized. Bullseye has a whole character arc...
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Shh.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Legion?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"He did say ""legitimate""."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Not canon or developed by Marvel Studio.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Daredevil for sure, but JJ not so much."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Those were before iron man 3?
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Might just mean the Feature Films.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Give it a week, who knows what's canon anymore."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Those characters were not clinically insane, to the point of seeing spirits and talking to statues for half their existence in the MU."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,No but he is a producer so it's also not like he doesn't have some voice in the creative process.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"The creator of the Moon Knight series previous work includes writing the live action Netflix Death Note film & Fant4stic. I have had zero faith in the writing of this project since learning that.

Edit: I am excited for Moon Knight still and very well could be awesome. Zero faith was a bit of hyperbole on my part. I’ll watch anything MCU and give it a genuine go."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I think it still had a satisfying conclusion to Wanda’s overall story arc in the series…it just had a typical marvel fight in the sky before it got there.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Seriously man those first 3 had me so hyped and then it got really meh at 4. Marvel needs to allow more creative control I mean WandaVision coulda been up there with daredevil and doom patrol which are some of the best superhero stuff ever and are legitimately great shows
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Same with Loki.

All the Disney+ shows pale in comparison to Daredevil."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I wish I liked it as much as you. To me the first 3 episodes felt like pale imitations of their respective sources of inspiration and none of the jokes landed because the actors and editors couldn’t recreate the timing of the original sitcoms.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Once the black SUVs pull up, I lose complete interest. Nothing can stand on its own in the MCU"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"The ending was very jarring. The entire show presents itself as aware of television tropes by parodying them, so when the final act suddenly discards the self-awareness and employs all the tries-and-true MCU tropes (villain is evil version of the hero, big CGI fight, setup for a more obscure side hero) as well as narrative dead-ends (Bohner, the SWORD director dude), it feels like a betrayal of the audience’s intelligence.  The end just doesn’t pay off what the rest of the series was selling."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I loved WandaVision up until the finale. It’s still my favorite Marvel show so far, but that finale dropped the ball in my opinion."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Take this upvote! And not just because you also are a fan of The Leftovers.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,it didn't even become just another marvel thing. more like sub marvel. no awesome fight at the end and no cool marvel tie ins.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Its just like the cast of mortal kombat talk how great the movie is, and turn out its so mehhh"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Oh man, I'm not alone. I shut off Wandavision after the episode with Darcy spouting technobabble and never turned it back on. I've watched and enjoyed many a marvel film before, but it was too sad to see something that was clearly striving for something more just kinda settle into that same bland, quippy rhythm."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"show just took a turn to become MCU movie halfway through. It wasn't bad, but it was disappointing to say the least."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"The pre-release PR machine for every MCU show/film touts the new release as being revolutionary and a huge change of pace, and then the film releases and it's just a bunch of beams shooting at each other and some fan service."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I really like me some Ragnarok
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Valid opinion, I prefer Civil War"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I think iron man set a successful style for sure, but Idk about best.


Winter soldier is my favorite Marvel film, neck and neck with Thor III (partly because the previous Thor movies are dogshit, esp. the first and I think waititi’s style really turned it around)"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I'm watching all the movies in order, and while the original Iron Man still holds up quite well, especially compared to most superhero movies of the era, to me it isn't even the best Phase 1 film - that honor goes to The Avengers. but I think I tend to prefer the team stories (at least the ones that work) over the solo outings.

Shang-Chi was a great recent solo origin film though, and I fear it's been overlooked in a sea of Marvel content. it's not a singular character study like Iron Man, but a great family drama wrapped up in Marvel mysticism."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,04 Punisher is the best
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Yeah it's actually a standalone movie, and the tech feels realistic even if it's futuristic. Every movie after this just becomes magic."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Daredevil, Jessica Jones, and Loki are the only ones that really qualify on that list and of those three two of them were treated as separate entities from the MCU, only tangentially related like Agents of Shield. He was likely speaking of the official MCU side of things so other than Loki he'd be right."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Feels weird to exclude Wandavision. The main character was the ""villain"" and the whole series was about her dealing with her grief. All of episode 8 was dedicated towards exploring her backstory."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"2 of those weren't developed by Feiges MCU team, the other three all came out after Isaac signed on to be this character, so he hadn't seen them when his desire to make this show a character study came about. Geez guys, settle down."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I'll give you Daredevil and Jessica Jones, but none of the others. TBH, the MCU fans running to the aid of even the *slightest* criticism of MCU properties is tiring and predictable. 


It's really starting to feel like MCU fandom is comprised of individuals who don't watch anything but comic book movies. Please watch something else to see how character studies and actual writing and character development can be done well."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Jessica Jones certainly, which is *entirely* a character study. Embarrassing statement from a guy I otherwise like."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,Spider-man? Get out of here.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,People calling falcon and the winter soldier a character study is something I want framed in my bathroom so I can feel better about myself after seeing myself in the mirror
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I liked it until it turned into a magic color battle in the sky. As well as the fact that they cut Dr. Strange so he wouldn’t mansplain everything to Wanda.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,As soon as episode 4 hit undoing the slow build up pace of episode 3 and just dropping almost the entirety of the mystery the show started dropping off and became generic. The whole second agent plotline was cheesy and generic as hell. Agatha was fun but as soon as she was shown for who she really was she was a really cheesy and generic cackling witch. The tone changed in bad way with episode 4 when previously it had this comedic but real unnerving vibe and then episode 4 took that away. The show kept trying to make Wanda's actions not bad as it they while also showing that it was bad it was very weird. I mean that never know what you sacrificed line. They made the agent boss man a bad guy and then he got arrested for doing things that honestly weren't that bad. It felt like they were painting the agents as also being in the wrong so Wanda didn't look as bad.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I believe most people disliked the finale. A major reason for that could've been too high expectations of other characters appearing in the finale which did not happen. Also, people have pointed out in this thread that it went back to typical Marvel formula of big CGI fight in the end. But what confuses is me is that people dislike WandaVision for having a CGI fight in the end, but love ShangChi despite being the most generic Marvel film. WV only had a few minutes of CGI fight between Agatha and Wanda, while Vis and Vis resolved their fight by mere conversation after 2 minutes of fighting."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,It is and you should say it.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Reddit doesn’t lol, it was very well received in general tho and is thought of highly, this sub pretty much turns on every marvel
Show so I wouldn’t really listen to their opinion on these shows. Reddit in general When it comes to huge tv shows and movies turns on most of them."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,I liked WandaVision the least tbh. I am the minority in that belief though.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Don’t worry, it’s just the “Reddit hates a thing that everyone likes” trope."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"Nah it’s a great show. People just act like because the last episode had 15 minutes of action they didn’t care for it ruined the entire thing for them, which is really stupid imo"
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,It is. Marvel fans are simply incapable of comprehending a character not being perfectly good/redeemed.
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,"I love the first 4-5 episodes. Then it all fell apart when SWORD got more and more involved. The finale was just trash, IMO."
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,The last episode of two of wandavision were cheesy to the point where i thought i was watching x men: the last stand
Iron Man: Armored Adventures,WandaVision was great until it devolved into typical MCU slop. The parody of sitcoms and the general feeling of uneasiness was where it shined. Once the Agatha twist was revealed the show fell flat.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Wow, Melanie Lynskey is getting a lot of work. Good for her!"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State, Jonah! That's awesome. Loved him in World on Fire.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Didn't know she was Australian until I saw Happy Christmas late last year, with herself, Lena Dunham and Anna Kendrick (it was shite)."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"(New Zealand, not Australia)"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"That’s crazy!

I had no idea she wasn’t American."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"It's a long article, here's where it says the problems start:

>At some point during the third season of Rick and Morty, multiple sources say Roiland simply stopped showing up — and when he did turn up in the Burbank offices, he’d typically avoid the writers room. In fact, Roiland’s colleagues often knew he was there only because they could hear his dogs. Or they’d hear his remote-control toy car, which had a microphone on top of it, zooming around the office. At least once, Roiland sent it into the writers room, says a source. “You wouldn’t have seen him in weeks, and then you’d see the car come in, which was insane.” Roiland would make exceptions to bring through famous fans, of which Rick and Morty has legions; at various points, his visitors included Kanye West, the comedians on Impractical Jokers and porn star Riley Reid, who gifted the room a succulent.

 
>By that time, Roiland had a girlfriend, who became a fiancée, and he would talk openly about their penchant for threesomes. “It was something we just ignored because it was disgusting,” says an insider. Multiple sources say it was also during that period that Roiland sent a female employee a “really creepy” text, late at night, requesting that she come to his home (they declined to name the staffer). “She didn’t want to run it up the flagpole,” says one of the sources, “and then it was just this really fucked-up, awkward thing.”

His Relationship with Dan Harmon:

>In the meantime, the relationship between Harmon and Roiland had grown so acrimonious that the show brought in a mediator to try to salvage what was once an inspired partnership. And though those efforts were unsuccessful, the pair was able to put aside their differences enough to secure a massive, 70-episode renewal from Adult Swim in May 2018. The pact, which ensured that the show would run for several more seasons, appeared to reward Rick and Morty for its precedent-smashing ratings for Adult Swim; by season five, the Emmy-winning series was reportedly generating hundreds of millions in merchandise revenue alone.

>In the years since, Roiland’s involvement on Rick and Morty has largely been relegated to voicing characters, for which he’d take no direction and record from his home. In fact, it has been years since anyone can remember him stepping foot in the show’s writers room, even when it’s been virtual. Recently, a similar situation has occurred on both Solar Opposites and Koala Man, according to multiple sources. On the former, which he co-created, he had, until mid-January, voiced one of the show’s leads. “He knew the power of being the voices,” says a source, noting how Roiland had revealed early on that he believed securing key voice roles would safeguard him from being fired one day. On Koala Man, on which he’s simply an executive producer, he was given a character to voice in the show’s third episode but, per two sources, the writers almost blew their deadline waiting for him. The character was killed off at the end of the episode."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Who knew that Dan Harmon would turn out to be the affable one?
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"The Roiland and Harmon part was pretty interesting, had no clue they had such issues with each other. I wonder if there was a single event or just what was discussed in the article that strained it?"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Sounds like Rick and Morty losing Roiland is not really going to effect that much, get a new voice actor or two and maybe they’ll actually show up and take direction. Could overall be a net positive for the series."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I really, really want to know what I have to do to get a job where I…

- Make millions
- Surround myself with geniuses
- Win my industry’s most prestigious awards
- Gain an army of rabidly enthusiastic fans
- Get more responsibilities and opportunities

…while also…

- Rarely show up to work, FOR YEARS
- Be loud and derailing in meetings
- Sexually harass women the instant I gain professional access to them
- Blow company money at Toys-R-Us
- Make everyone around me look and feel bad

And literally not one person rats on me? Fires me? Blows my shit up? Not one?!

Like. How. Where. What do I have to do to get a life where I am coddled like a precious boy-king."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Why is he Sonic
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"The only time I've heard Justin Roiland speak (as himself) was an episode of Harmontown he appeared on. The dude seemed really out there. Like on drugs AND a crazy weirdo.  When listening I was thinking ""uh oh...he's one of those show runners. The kind who will be in the news eventually"""
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,So...like [John Kricfalusi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kricfalusi) and *Ren & Stimpy*?
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"A tale as old as time: “We were always aware of the unethical/illegal actions of this person who made all of us a lot of money, but didn’t want to say anything until the actions are already made known to the public.”"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"It’s amazing how often this article repeats how Rolland is barely involved with Rick and Morty, as if to ensure it can continue on Adult Swim with minimal blowback.

That said, would Roiland still benefit from royalties even as he is cut off?"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I don't think Roiland was ever considered a genius, unlike Dan Harmon. He was funny, with a lot of energy, and was a big part of the show's success... but that's not genius territory."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I don't know about the rest of yall, but I never attributed R&M success to roiland, I always thought it was Harmon with a good writing room. I always assumed roiland was just voice work...and not good work at that. All his fucking voices sound damn near identical...except Rick IS unique compared to the rest."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Is it really a surprise that fans felt his career was ""suddenly derailed"" when the reason why was kept a secret up until just recently?"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Honestly I'm hopeful that the R&M writers will make the best of this. From this article and others it seems like Harmon and the other main show runners have been done with Roiland for a LONG time and he hasn't had meaningful creative input. Hopefully this is like a weight lifted for the rest of the writing staff.

The bigger unanswered question as I see it is what the next season will be like. Fairly sure it's already completely written (and maybe completely voiced too?) So do they rerecord Roiland's lines? And I feel like they'll have to add in at least a 30 second joke about the voice change. I hope the show carries on the same or better though 🤞"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"As a fan of the show (who’s used to liking things with awful fan bases) I was always annoyed by roiland and thought that he was only around because the seed of the idea was his from back in channel 101 days… but it’s so obviously Dan harmon’s show and ideas.

edit: originally autocorrected fan bases to canvases lol"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Never meet your heroes
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I'm reminded of what happened to Noel Clarke in the UK. BAFTA fellowship winner to career effectively over in under a week when 20 women came forward with claims of bullying, verbal abuse and sexual harassment. 

ITV had to pull the final episode of a ""stripped"" series from regular airing when the advertisers bailed, Sky had to cancel *Bulletproof* and BAFTA revoked his fellowship. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence, but he's done."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,You either die a Morty or live long enough to to see yourself become the Rick ah geee
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"He always gave off a manchild vibe, like he never actually matured to adulthood. Good riddance, I suppose."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Clearly this is another example of sex addiction a disease that overwhelmingly affects rich and powerful men.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"“More recently, multiple sources say that Roiland, other than voice work, has not had any meaningful creative presence on any of the series that bear his name. In fact, many of his former colleagues say they haven’t heard from him in years, and when they have, it’s been unpleasant.”

I have been theorizing this for YEARS and I’m not just saying that because this article is shitting on him. I’ve always felt like he’s been a hyped up voice actor, with the limit of his creativity in R&M being the designs of the characters and Ricks ship. I’d be curious to see what else he came up with, but it’s always seemed like he did barely enough to earn that co creator title with Dan Harmon, who actually writes it. Maybe Rolland came up with the idea, which would make him a creator, but that’s the bare minimum of what people consider a creator."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Can these people just stop being creeps so that shows/movies/music stop getting ruined
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"“I turned my self into a felon, Morty! I’m WIFE BEATER RIIICCKKKK!!”"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I had heard from a chick I knew, of his predilection. She said he was into 3 ways, but also mid teenage girls. Something like once he had some $ or any amount of power/fame he used it to hookup with the girls that wouldn't have given him the time of day when he was still a nobody."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"The moment I heard that Justin Roiland and Alex Hirsch had been hanging out together a lot, I knew exactly what was wrong. This guy doesn’t show up to work and thinks he’s the hottest shit for the work he doesn’t show up to anymore"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I wish I was surprised by the fans' reaction, but I'm just not."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Imagine you're in a meeting and the boss drives a little R/C car in there with a microphone stuck on top and just parks it lol
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Eerie similarities with John K. and how that sexual predator went down in flames.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,It derailed before that. He was apparently a raging alcoholic. I hope he finds help.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I love how it's always ""quirky genius"" instead of ""fucking asshole"" until the appalling behavior comes to light."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Let's be real, who isn't really excited to see the next season now?

First you have two main characters getting recast and you know damn well they will find fantastic talent. Even if you can just barely hear a difference, I'm looking forward to that. And the obligatory meta scene about it. Hell make a whole episode plot about it!

Plus I always felt Harmon was the man behind the great story telling. And now this just confirms it. Without Roiland, I bet that Harmon won't be hindered by Justin's douchebagerry and we will see some of the
Best story telling the show has seen.

And there is a part of me that wants Roiland to watch R&M succeed even more so without him just so he can feel some negative emotions and knock that fucker down a few pegs."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Is there anyone here that remembers Bewitched?  One week they just replaced the dad and no one said a thing. I was confused but the new dad was a huge improvement from the old one.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Dude was never a genius. He was a drunk idiot who did funny voices and threw out ""lolsorandom"" ideas in the writers room at best. Guy cant write a story to save his life and the best thing hes ever come up with is Lemongrabs scream. He never has or could, so I never understand why people think just cause his names in the opening titles that hes actually making these stories. Every episode is writers + Harmon with random shit sprinkled in by Justin. Writers + Harmon alone will be fine and probably better as the weirdest fans of this show always seemed to be the ones on Roilands dick."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,He sounds like an asshole who made something cool once or twice. R&M is hilarious.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I always scratch my head after reading a story like this, in which only one the interviewees is quoted as being concerned about whether this individual was inappropriate with a female colleague. Everyone else is worried about the prestige of their creative products. I’m not saying you can’t worry about that—of course, it’s natural—I’m saying…Roilands are everywhere, and they proliferate in part because most people do not care about the targets of their abuse until it becomes a larger issue."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I've heard from people who know him that he's a total dick. Like, obviously funny from afar, but insufferable if you have to interact with him."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,I have a family member who works in the entertainment industry and they told me years ago that there’s been rumors of this stuff. Sucks to hear it’s true.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,It would be great if his punishment could also somehow include McDonald's Szechuan Sauce.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Never go full John K
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Following his Instagram years ago was what led to that realization for me. Getting that extra little look into how he is when he openly expresses himself quickly tipped me off that this guy just isn’t right. He really just comes off as this emotional immature, overly volatile person who can never identify when to stop. And that last one is a big sticking point"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Not a single person I know, fans included, were surprised by this"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"It’s always great when the people in power who had the ability to call out shitty behavior years ago, all come out after the fact to say they knew about it. See Harvey Weinstein."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,This was not shocking to me. Rick and Marty while intelligent is clearly a cry for help and the “method acting” behind the scenes video he put out of him getting drunk in the office back in like 2017 was the first indicator to me that he was unwell mentally in some capacity.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Quirky? I thought the mofo was just creepy
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"It's not a long list, but I've never found people who have to drink to be creative to be good people. It's well known that Justin and many of the other writers would get drunk in the writing room and Justin would get drunk to do his voice acting work.

Roosterteeth is another company that's going through some controversy now and has always had a pretty steep drink culture.

I say this as someone who drinks, and likes to get drunk when the mood is right. If you have to get shit-faced to make entertaining stuff you've got a problem."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Someday, maybe “colleagues” will speak up in these situations.  

Unless we want more George Santoses and Justin Rollandses?"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"While interesting I'm kinda skeptical of tabloids after watching Harry & Meagan. But really does make you think, curious what Harmon's take on this guy is."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Can’t trust someone in thin glasses
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"""Suddenly derailed"" by charges from like two or three years ago 🤔"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Imagine being such a maniac that Dan Harmon is the adult in the room.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Not to downplay Roiland as being a massive creep, but I have to admit; I did get a bit of a chuckle out of the article's attempt to wring maximum salaciousness out of the Riley Reid angle by framing it as him ""parading a high-profile porn star"" around the writer's room as if he had her naked and filming a hardcore scene in front of everyone to their maximum discomfort, when apparently it sounds like it was actually one of the more wholesome parts of this whole affair. She bought them all a houseplant for heaven's sake!"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Seems to me they put this article out in an attempt to assuage fans of their fears that this guy leaving will destroy the show.  It’s no different from an advertisement in the form of an article.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,You read the bizarre defenses of talking about threesomes in the workplace and then you understand why the Rick and Morty fanbase is considered so toxic.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"All the people here saying ""I always thought Dan Harmon was the genius...not Justin Roiland"" are so full of shit. Some of us were here on Reddit when Rick and Morty originally dropped and y'all had Roilands cock so far down your throats."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Ah geez 😳
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I am glad to hear he wasn't doing the writing. At least I know the show won't be missing that aspect and I don't care much if Morty changes a little. The only question is how much was riffing that I enjoyed in dialog, but I am sure an actual voice collaborator will make up for this."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,100 years
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Honestly not to sound judgmental but I wasn't surprised when it came out he had been messaging underage girls, the kind of ""jokes"" he was making a lot of the time on podcasts were in line with that."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,I would be willing to bet a large sum of money that Dan Harmon has lots of sexual misconduct skeletons in his closet
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,It turns out the toxic fan base is recantation of Roiland himself
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I guess it’s not surprising that Justin turned out to be pretty fucking weird and exploitive, given how his creative career started with insane shit like Doc and Mharti

Like, I’m pretty sure most people that weren’t totally disgusted by it were thinking “holy shit this guy is nuts, I wonder what would happen if he was given a real budget and a staff”. Fast forward and… he’s an abusive sociopath! Surprise!"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"So he hasn't been involved in the show's writing room since season 2.

That's weird, everyone at /r/rickandmorty kept saying how essential he is to the future of the series."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I’ve suspected that the writers have long detected red flags with Roiland.

While these companies are free to work with anyone he and to a degree Harmon seem to be the type of people you should probably have a “parted ways” statement on standby."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,How is this a surprise. He’s a POS and said some really weird stuff to minor girls through DMs. Doesn’t help how unfunny he is either; always the same stupid voice
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"How brave of these colleagues to speak up now after the crimes have been made public and their comments don’t impact their own ability to make money. 

True heroes."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,But no one  still listens to Chris Brown right??
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Justin Roiland's contributions weren't even really to writing. His idea of writing is just making up characters with silly names like ""Shploobie Bibbles"" and juvenile gross-out humor. 2 of his 5 writing credits over 6 seasons of R&M were inter dimensional cable, which we all know is largely improvised, and see my point above about Shploobie Bibbles. New voice for the titular characters will be the biggest change, and I doubt very many reasonable people will end up giving a fuck."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,His behavior was troubling in public.  I listened to one episode of his podcast and felt like my soul needed a powerwashing afterwords.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Thumbnail at a glance makes him look like a bad Sonic the Hedgehog OC.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Lol I saw him as sonic in the thumbnail instead of Rick and was very confused
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,So all the people freaking out about Roiland's involvement blew it way out of the proportion outside or doing voices
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,But Elon Musk said he’s the heart of the show!
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,When did assholery become ok some might say. Others would say it’s always been. I’m sad for folks who he wronged. Feel stupid for finally getting to these shows and then this.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,What a big dumb douchebaggy bag'a douche.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"&#x200B;

Holy shit, the [tiny RC car with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii6XuM187Zo) on it is real"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Amazingly well researched article. 

What a creepy fuck this Roiland turned out to be"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Next time they gonna say is that he started his own religion. Pigs are people.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"If story accurate, all he did was make himself easy to replace. Never a good idea in any job. His role was get the ball rolling and voice work. Like any exec producer really.  

This is different then why most of us thought which was he was neck deep in the day to day work of getting the shows made and so his voice (literal and figuratively) were a critical component. That clearly isn’t the case.

If you think all those Steven Spielberg producing credits was him rolling up his sleeves and getting to work, you lost your minds. His roll was to pitch it, get the money on board and then sit back, let everyone do the actual work and reap the benefits.

After that the actual creatives did the heavy lifting of the writing, directing, animating while Roiland just did voice work from comfort of home. Not saying voice actors are not important, but unlike some live action shows, they can be replaced as there are many that can mimic the voice.

As for his silence, well duh. Even a first year law student will tell you to “shut the f—- up” when involved in criminal and civil cases. The worse thing he can do is say anything. Look at Adam Baldwin and his ill advised interview and how that is going to be used against him."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"For a man who created Rick Sanchez, I'll say it again, I'm not that surprised."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Ahh yes, Hollywood reporter, they’re not bias or clickbaity."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"It really sounds like roiland just kept being himself and the success made everyone else be more cautious and that just didnt vibe with the “we are successful now so we must change” turn everyone took

You know, excluding the abuse stuff which is obviously terrible"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Whoda thought that the alcoholic who disguises hedonism as “complex” nihilism is actually an annoying and crass human being.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Incoming netflix docuseries
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Yoga
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,How is everyone in this comment section ignoring the fact that he's a huge pedo? That news is definitely what resulted in adult swim cutting ties.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"so basically, everything was fine as long as he brought them fame and power? yeh, sounds bout right."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,Roiland trying to be Rick in real life.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,When I first saw Rick and Morty I thought it was funny. When I saw that everything he has ever done is the same damn voice and humor I found him way less funny.
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,It’s always guys like Roiland that try to get their reports to join them for a threesome. 🤢
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"An episode aired last night with the toxic versions of Rick and Morty and it never occurred to me that Morty seduced two grown ass women, until just then. Never really put much thought into some of the shit that happens in the show until this stuff started coming out."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"I really like Solar Opposites, more than R and M. It’s a shame celebrities turn into raging douche canoes when they get a little money in the bank"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"He’d get shitfaced drunk to record his lines for Rick, how anyone would be surprised that he isn’t an alcoholic piece of shit outside of the recording booth is beyond me."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Quirky genius? No, fuck that. 

I once pointed out awhile back, before the accusations began, that someone whose entire fame started with a BTTF parody in which Doc Brown wants Marty to suck him off, might not be the most stable guy in the room. I got downvoted to hell for it because you can't question the 'genius"" of some artists I guess. Those fans helped this guy gain his power, that he went on to abuse other creators and artists. They saw a guy who went through a lot of trouble to make the joke, ""a grown adult  wants oral sex from a teenager"" and said, ""shut up and take my money"" and he went on to become a grown adult trying to fuck teenagers. 

Who.

Fucking.

Knew."
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"They should just write in Morty going through a late puberty, hire an actor with a crazy deep voice and never mention it again"
Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State,"Any true fan would have seen this coming a mile away, when I saw his method acting video like 4 years ago, I knew he had a lot of demons and trauma he wasn't able to deal with and his alcoholism was only going to get worse and get him into trouble."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I would give anything for this.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Please god
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,yes please
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I would be all in
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Yes! Do it! :-)
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I live for this show.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,And Billy Drago :(
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Same
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Just don’t have it on Starz
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Same!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,You don't know Jack
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Sho Nuff!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,You love to hear it
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Fred Fredburger was a name known by every kid at my middle school.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Hoss Delgado is my homeboy
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,DESTROY US ALL!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Clowns hate tangelos
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,One of Cartoon Network’s best and a true shame the whole series isn’t on DVD.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Scrape and lick.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"""Hateful fart cartoon"" is going to be one of my favorite descriptions of anything, ever."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"[They caused Property Damage, Like an Angry Woman](https://youtu.be/5vA5c5-7d-w)"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Please pass the egg salad.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Loved billy’s relationship with his adopted spider son
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [“Why won’t you love me dad?! I’ll be anything you want me to be!”](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Loved it
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Definitely a favorite of mine
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I still, to this day, reference the root beer fountain episode.

""Un*LIMITED* access, *to the fountain*"""
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Yes.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,F R E D B U R G E R
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Juuudge? Can I have some nachos?
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I think he's earned a free hotdog
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"""The name's Hoss. Hoss *(muscle flex)* Del-*(muscle flex)*-ga-*(muscle flex)*-do"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"No joke, we literally just finished that episode and then I saw this comment."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,I'll have the chicken.
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Honest to God I can remember being a kid and seeing a billboard with this on it. It confused the hell out of my Dad at the time I know. 

Hope I'm not the only one who remembers seeing that weird phase of CN advertising lol"
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,Yeah I agree but at least it’s on HBO Max
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,That's pretty much just Richard Horvitz's real voice
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"I love Dracula. He's not just Black, he's *Black*. 

""Everybody know Dracula turn into a bat! That's what Dracula do!"""
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"Actually, there were lots of great episodes, thinking about it. Underrated great show."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,"> And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized.

While not untrue, Billy and Mandy really stands alone in this era and all Childrens TV animation. Only comparable stuff was on Adult Swim."
The Adventures of Chuck and Friends,The single bumper clip of Mandy quoting the tenets of satanism would have unleashed a firestorm of bad press if released today.

Thomas and Friends,"I think one of the things that give Seinfeld an edge is that the characters are never presented as good people. They're all shitty and that's part of it. So things that might have been considered benign at the time, but don't  age well are easier to shrug off. Friends continually tries to tell you they're good people and good friends when they're all actually terrible so they just become worse over time."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld just seemed to have so many things that relate to life in general. Odd given the nature of the show, but I'm always using ""like on Seinfeld"". Double dip, man hands, not that there's anything wrong with it, regifter, opposite George, etc. 

Cripes, just yesterday I saw a dumpster diver eating a donut from the trash and thought of George."
Thomas and Friends,"“We’re not gay! …Not that there’s anything wrong with that.” 

So many lines were ahead of their time and hold up well."
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld by far. To me the cynicism holds up better than the corny sentimentality where everybody hugs and learns a lesson.
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld, it’s indisputable"
Thomas and Friends,Now start watching Curb your Enthusiasm
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld and it's not close. Seinfeld has always been a better show imo.
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld has aged better because a lot of the stories are based on every day real life situations. How many times has something happened in your life that made you think of a Seinfeld episode vs how many times has something made you think of Friends?
Thomas and Friends,[removed]
Thomas and Friends,"One is the greatest network comedy ever.

the other is Friends.

IMO the writing on Seinfeld was so far ahead of the game people are still catching up."
Thomas and Friends,"I still love both these shows, and I think they both hold up. 

Friends hit its stride at the end of season 3, when Ross and Rachel really broke up. It seems the writers shifted all the characters into quirky, weird characteristics besides Ross being the lovelorn mopey guy, Monica being the straight woman, Chandler being just a comic relief, etc. This ended up giving the show refreshing storylines to feed off of as opposed to the cookie cutter sitcom it started as.

Seinfeld is similar in that it hit its real stride a few seasons in. All of the characters were gloriously unlikeable yet lovable, but I think Elaine was the real gem in the bunch. I always thought it was pretty brave for JLD to play such a brash character, for a woman comedian it was really refreshing to see her be just as bad as the guys as opposed to being the straight woman trying to keep them in check. Sweet Dee on Sunny is directly influenced by her portrayal. 

Each of these shows have catch phrases that are a part of pop culture, each show is still funny despite knowing what that joke is that you heard for the 20th time. Both are classics, but different types of shows that went against the grain and ended up becoming classics."
Thomas and Friends,"Ngl. Its interesting seeing some of the replies here as a person from the UK. Seinfeld barely got much of a chance to get going here (dont blame the people, blame the channels over here messing up schedules MAJOR at the time), whereas Friends was and is still HUGE here. Like there's legit a small chain of central perk replica coffee shops here within one of the biggest fashion stores here and you can find friends merch anywhere. 

Like due to that Seinfeld has always felt like this weird hipster show for friends haters to me. ""Oh, you like friends? That's so basic and mainstream. Seinfeld is way better."" and I know elsewhere in the world ESPECIALLY in the US it isn't true. But yeah... its just the way it feels and looks from this side if the planet. 😅"
Thomas and Friends,The funny one.
Thomas and Friends,"Lot of Friends hate one here. But honestly, They’re both really great shows that have aged pretty brilliantly. 

One took the sitcom formula and pretty much perfected it. The other took the sitcom formula and found hilarious ways to subvert it. Both shows were exceptionally cast.

I feel like Reddit seems to look at Friends as being hokey and sentimental, but it’s no worse than Parks and Reck and The Office US in that regard and the writing in those early seasons especially was really fresh and clever."
Thomas and Friends,"People on here have such a huge hate boner for Friends lol

There's a reason it's as popular as it is"
Thomas and Friends,"Asking reddit to choose between Friends and Seinfeld is a forgone conclusion, the reddit demo will always favor Seinfeld. But if you were to ask randoms on the street, Friends will win out 8 times out of 10.

I like them both but Friends is my comfort show and the one I have rewatched more often."
Thomas and Friends,"Have 30 somethings at my work place that watch Friends over and over.  One says she has seen every episode at least 15 times.  Seinfeld was smarter and has more memorable lines, but younger generations have not discovered it like they have discovered Friends.  Both funny as hell."
Thomas and Friends,"It’s highly subjective. 

Growing up with friends felt a lot more digestible and easier to follow. The narcissism of Seinfeld didn’t become clear to me until i was older and able to understand the situation the characters were placed in.

Friends storylines felt a lot more simplified. Universal storytelling vs situational experiences.

Both hold space where needed. 

Overall, for me - Friends aged well as a comfort watch and Seinfeld aged best with personal experiences."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld ages better because it fused one of the greatest comedy writers ever (Larry David) with three of the greatest performers of their time (Alexander, Richards, Dreyfuss)
No, I didn’t leave out any names here."
Thomas and Friends,"I don’t even see how the two can compare - friends is a good sitcom, but very low hanging fruit comedy that comes together with likable characters and typical “will they, won’t they” tropes, where as Seinfeld is legit great writing, had timeless jokes, unique characters, and paved the way for shows with terrible characters that have little to no development while still maintaining audience interest.  Just one man’s opinion."
Thomas and Friends,"My vote is for Seinfeld. But Im going to selfishly take this opportunity to stick up for Friends and fight back against the the online hate that show brings in. 

I am old enough to have appreciated the later seasons live as they aired and to be aware of what a massive phenomenon it was in its day. It was everyone’s favorite show (if I may generalize). I watched all the reruns at 6 and 6:30 every day. By the time the show finished I probably saw the whole series 2 or 3 times over. then I got older and went through the phase of thinking it was uncool, unfunny, and out dated. Then I got even older and it was released on HBO Max and I decided to get nostalgic and start from episode 1. The show is a monumental achievement in entertainment. They created SIX ICONIC characters over 10 seasons with a joke-a-minute prime time sitcom. The actors delivered every time. The roles they played were not easy. If you can’t laugh at Friends then that’s on purpose and you’re just trying to be a contrarian hipster who just won’t like any multicam sitcom. But if you can appreciate the format at all, let go of ego, Friends is funny. 

Seinfeld is better tho 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Thomas and Friends,"I realize I am really going to cut against the grain here, but I have to answer this question truthfully:

Friends, and it is not even close.

I’m not saying it’s better than Seinfeld because it totally is NOT. But OP said “aged better.” 

I live in NYC and I work in tourism. The number of people I’ve met who are desperate to see the Friends apartment, Friends locations real and fake (no, Central Perk is not a real coffee shop), extends into the hundreds.

I’ve not met a single person who asks me about Seinfeld.

All those Friends fanatics? They are all 20 or younger.

Friends is MASSIVELY popular among Gen Z kids, who find it alternately relatable (because stories are simple and the characters are very archetypal) and exotic (no smartphones or social media, and the characters on Friends not-so-coincidentally seem to have much richer relationships with each other).

Friends has resonated in a major, major way a generation later. Seinfeld has not. Seinfeld is much more specific in its humor and more rooted in 90s history (don’t know who George Steinbrenner and Johnnie Cochran were? Too bad for you!), and I don’t think its very white/Jewish-centric vision of New York, where other ethnicities are typically encountered in service industries or as exotic Others, has aged well for 2020s sensibilities. Does Friends have the white-centric problem, too? Hell yes, even more so, but its edges so sanded and its humor so seemingly benign that I can see why people give it more of a pass.

TL, DR: Friends has a huge Gen Z fanbase, Seinfeld does not. Ergo, Friends has “aged better”, though I agree Seinfeld was a much, much better show."
Thomas and Friends,"I like both shows, but objectively speaking, I think Seinfeld is far superior.

It just has way more creativity and unique premises and I think writing is superior. Friends is a good sitcom, but I don’t think it necessarily has anything that sets it apart from most other sitcoms as its own thing besides the fountain dancing intro titles and music. I too watched Friends first and thought it was one of the greatest shows ever, but then started seeing Seinfeld and newer shows like Community and Parks and Rex and saw how superior they are.

Seinfeld didn’t need a famous guest star every week, but I think Friends purposely went that route in the latter half largely because I think they knew the writing and characters weren’t strong enough to succeed on its own and triedmto overcompensate with big name guest stars like Willis, Pitt, DeVito, Penn and, Kathleen Turner and Goldblum, among others.

Friends was and is a very ordinary - but entertaining- sitcom with a flashy exterior and good jokes, but didn’t have the substance the way Seinfeld or Parks and Rec or Community or Frasier and many others do. It was always a fun show but I don’t think much more than that."
Thomas and Friends,Friends is 100x more popular and gets more views. So depends what you want to take into account. This is kinda like avatar where reddit thinks avatar/friends suck but the majority of the world loves avatar/friends.
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld is more farcical and Friends has a bit more heart. Maybe I’m getting softer as I get older but I gravitate more towards Friends.
Thomas and Friends,"*Seinfeld* influenced modern comedy more than *Friends* - Larry David shaped a generation of White guys' sense of humor.
  
*Friends* benefits from having some post-9/11 seasons and just *feels* more modern. Rachel also influenced a whole generation of White girls' wardrobe."
Thomas and Friends,"Controversial certainly reading the rest of this thread, but I regularly still rewatch Friends, while very little of the humor in Seinfeld does anything for me. (I also love always sunny, which people often compare Seinfeld to).

I think Friends holds up not because of the humor, but in spite of it, it's a very feel good show, it always works out for them and a lot of the struggles are relatable to a 20-30 year old trying to be a grown-up for the first time. When I'm in a bad mood and am ""stuck in second gear"", then it kind of cheers me up, but Seinfeld doesn't do that, and I'd rather watch Always Sunny for the fun hijinks with the absurd stories and bonkers characters, when I'm in the mood for that."
Thomas and Friends,"Seems a lot people here aren’t answering the question. They’re just answering what do they prefer. As for me, I think Friends has aged better. Seinfeld is a 90s show in its references. Which makes sense obviously as it was almost solely set in the 90s. As someone else said, I think Friends benefits in relation to this question from having some of it set past 9/11, when the world was a different place."
Thomas and Friends,"Never liked Seinfeld, might be an American thing I never understood. 

Friends was funny at times and woudn't be suprised if some channels sti air episodes. Just like married with children stil airs -.-"
Thomas and Friends,"This is such a weird argument. One show is a literal milestone of television comedy, the other is a show lots of people seem to enjoy. 

Apples and oranges."
Thomas and Friends,Reddit leans Seinfeld. But they’re both great
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld is funnier to me now as I’m at the age of the characters. Friends was never funny to me regardless of age.
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld and it's not particularly close. Seinfeld vs Frasier is a better question.
Thomas and Friends,"Whichever people choose, I’d say they’re both white."
Thomas and Friends,"Everything in this thread saying Friends isn’t funny to seem smarter than they are 🙄. Seinfeld is the better show, but the Friends writers room wasn’t slacking and the cast was also great."
Thomas and Friends,"One invented No Nut November, the other still gets people to clap along to a theme song"
Thomas and Friends,"Also Kevin Bright who made Friends is a huge asshole. He was an alumni of my school and came around all the time. He always introduced himself as “the guy who made Friends,”… he complained that he didn’t work on sets anymore because everyone was too Pc and wouldn’t let him give them unsolicited massages… and when he would come as a guest for our annual awards show, there had to be a special student assigned to him to make sure he didn’t act creepy to any women."
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld. Friends is just white Living Single
Thomas and Friends,"For the average person probably friends, for redditors, its always seinfeld"
Thomas and Friends,"Contrary to everyone here, Friends. Seinfeld has far too many pop culture references that someone not from that era wouldnt understand. I was born in the 90s and I don't even get some of the people/references they say. There's no damn way a person born now would get a lot of the jokes. Don't get me wrong, Seinfeld is far better written but it's humor also has a long set up, whereas Friends is that cheap easy humor. You'd actually need to watch a whole episode of Seinfeld and pay attention to it in order to get the payoff, whereas Friends you could leave on the background and still enjoy it."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld is the obvious answer. Friends is a relic of that old hokey manufactured sitcom vibe. While definitely a more modern take, it has more in common with Cheers than with modern TV.

Seinfeld was so innovative in its style that people literally referred to it as a show about nothing. When you really think about that, it is bizarre. At that time, people needed each episode wrapped in a convenient storyline that taught a lesson to actually perceive storytelling. Seinfeld blew up that notion and allowed characters to exist as morally ambiguous without being ""punished"" (and then when they did get ""punished"" in the finale, the audience felt betrayed). Storylines were less cliched and more based on the small minutia of everyday life and poking holes in the absurdity of modern society -- basically the default tone of most social media platforms these days. It isn't that crazy to draw a line from Seinfeld's take on character to the beginning of prestige TV like The Sopranos and The Wire, when TV audiences finally accepted that it is far more interesting to not be force fed whether a character is a hero or a villain."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld, always. The show is/was brilliant and could never be replicated."
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld. Although I would say Curb is the one that will age like a fine wine.
Thomas and Friends,"Friends is what Seinfeld would have been if the network had been calling all the development shots: get a couple more girls, make everyone younger and pretty, include a Sam and Diane couple. Given that, Friends was executed very well."
Thomas and Friends,"Well I've never liked Friends in the first place. 

But Seinfeld is immortal. It's a much more human show."
Thomas and Friends,Mulva > Unagi
Thomas and Friends,I always found Seinfeld to be more relatable.
Thomas and Friends,"One good way is to compare similar episodes. The classic Seinfeld episode about masturbation famously used “master of my domain” as a euphemism to get around network censors. The episode humorously explored the central role that it plays in our lives and differences between men and women, cleverly couched in a friendly contest. A masterpiece of sitcom writing.

The Friends episode “The one about whacking off” is much cruder. The scene where Ross and Chandler are racing to see who finishes on Joey first lacks the nuances of the Seinfeld contest. And the lack of a comparable scene with the girls smacks of early 90s sexism.

Overall it’s very clear which was the greater comedy."
Thomas and Friends,"Friends has some very dated jokes. Seinfeld has some dated situations (the speed dial episode for example), but the humor is timeless."
Thomas and Friends,"In my mind there doesn’t need to be a debate as to which is better. I like both shows.

There’s a lot of dislike for Friends here. I don’t know. I think it’s very funny."
Thomas and Friends,"A lot of Seinfeld was dealing with issues that wouldn't happen anymore, like waiting at a land line for a call or misunderstandings that we instantly solve with a smartphone. Friends was a bunch of people trying to fuck. I think Seinfeld is a way better show but it hasn't aged as well"
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld, without question.

Even though it's a 90s show about 30 somethings, it's still so applicable today and to a broad audience.

I've watched it over and over again throughout the years since I was 12 years old. I'm now approaching 30 and I know all the lines by now, and I'm still laughing and hollering at every episode. It's not like it even had just a few good episodes or seasons, there's so many classics! Heck the festivus episode was in the final season! 

It's just the all-time best comedy show and will always be my all-time favorite TV show. 

FRIENDS is probably only better to a certain demographic."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld.

The premise of Friends was created by an 8 year old girl. Me and my friends are all going to live in the same place and we can play everyday. Our boyfriends will live in the same building and we can all date when we want too. And everything is going to be really really fun."
Thomas and Friends,Friends is for the undateable.
Thomas and Friends,It’s Seinfeld by a mile. Haven’t watched Friends in quite a while but it doesn’t strike me as the type of show that would’ve aged well. Seinfeld is still funny as shit. And relevant.
Thomas and Friends,"As a HUGE Seinfeld fan, I was pretty pissed when people started comparing these two shows a little while back. In my mind it was even close.

My wife started watching friends again, and I have to admit, it was way better then I remembered. Definitely, not as good as Seinfeld, but it was closer then I thought.

Seinfeld 10/10

Friends 9/10"
Thomas and Friends,There are rarely days that go by that are not relatable to Seinfeld. It is infinitely more quotable. Seinfeld has a timeless quality that is not matched by Friends. Seinfeld and The Office is a better comparison.
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld. Better jokes.
Thomas and Friends,I watched Friends and loved it for years and then found Seinfeld in 2020 and there simply isn't any comparison for me - Seinfeld is far superior and I love it dearly and watch it every day. I'm bonkos about Seinfeld 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld was more realistic in their living situation, such as not being able to afford these huge apartments on minimal salary etc. 

Oh and Seinfeld had actual comedy ..."
Thomas and Friends,"ITT, Seinfeld good, Friends bad."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld, by far.  It's always relatable and always hilarious.  Friends was good too but the characters are just so.........likeable.  The UN-likability of Seinfeld's characters makes it timeless."
Thomas and Friends,Friends is really unfunny. It tries too hard and falls flat; the humour is so forced. It also feels dated. Seinfeld is timeless. Far superior on every front.
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld and the Episode in the Hampton’s — have not seen anything better in comedy after that — Seinfeld is the GOAT 😊

Please, you have to see the baaaabbbyyyy 😅"
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld embraced being terrible people and that was part of the appeal (IASIP does this well, too). Friends characters didn’t seem horrible at the time but in retrospect they’re unbearable."
Thomas and Friends,"how is this even a question? seinfeld by faaaarrr

friends is a show set in new york fucking city and it features ONLY white people. wtf is that?"
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld is the Goat!!
Thomas and Friends,I think both are for different crowds. You probably won't ever get an unbiased answer. Not that there's anyone wrong with that!
Thomas and Friends,"Friends was never funny, All the actors are now washed up and trying to stay relevant. Didnt the show try to reboot and flop? I dont think I've ever met anyone who actually liked the show and wasnt above the age of 40. And that was a long time ago.

everyone I know who has seen sienfeld still loves it, and my family and I watch it together sometimes. Even though it can be mundane and dated at times, it still holds up really well"
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld by far. I used to be a staunch friends stan when I was a teenager but damn it's near unwatchable now.
Thomas and Friends,"Friends =  characters have redeeming values.

Seinfeld = no one has any redeeming values. 

Seinfeld all day."
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld. Friends has always been trash.
Thomas and Friends,"Since Seinfeld was WAY better while it aired, it’s also better now. That’s my crazy take."
Thomas and Friends,"You’re asking this on the internet, my friend. The overwhelming consensus is going to be Seinfeld. By a wide margin."
Thomas and Friends,"friends comes off super fake now. they also seem much older then they are. 
its bizarre to me that ""a show about nothing"" was an unheard of concept and i suppose at the time ahead of its time. even though i thought seinfeld was lame (i didnt get it) as a kid its aged better. 
although it was hilarious that teens thought friends was a new netflix show. then target ruined everything by merchandising it to DEATH"
Thomas and Friends,"Friends turned into a bunch of Adults acting like dumb teens living in conditions they can't effort with their incomes in a New York that doesn't exist as they present it while handling unrelatable shit in unrealistic ways. I never liked friends and personally find it one of the most overrated shows in the history of television. Seinfeld however is very relatable and realistic which besides the set feeling outdated (yet good for the time they made it) making it sort of a timeless show, the jokes and situations still work."
Thomas and Friends,"I like them both. Friends is too nostalgic for me. But Seinfeld probably ages the best as it is a show about nothing. :D

Also, my fav sitcom from the ""old days"" is probably Fraiser. Seen it first time few years back and it is amazing."
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld is still relevant. Everyone has had a bad parking experience or been ""Happy New Year""'ed in Feb."
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld. By miles
Thomas and Friends,Sinefield.  Curb is still a great show with a similar concept.
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld is timeless and still holds up. Friends is almost unwatchable now.
Thomas and Friends,Friends was shit when it came out
Thomas and Friends,"Friends, but it’s not necessarily because it’s a better show. So many shows have taken what Seinfeld did and built on it or downright stolen from it.

As a person who has watched both, I laugh more at Friends. When I watch Seinfeld, I understand that it is funny, but I’m able to predict where it’s going because modern sitcoms have been shaped by it to the point that my thought process is able to jump to the punchline before it happens on screen. 

This is so common that there’s a whole page on TV Tropes about it: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldIsUnfunny"
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld, 100%"
Thomas and Friends,Seinfeld. The jokes are actually still funny. Friends..... not so much.
Thomas and Friends,I don't find Seinfeld even remotely funny.  Maybe it's because I'm British?
Thomas and Friends,I never cared for Seinfeld.
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld’s characters are not sympathetic. We like them in spite of who they are. Friends’s characters are by comparison very sympathetic. We like them in spite of what they *do*.

I think the easiest comparison is how each show handles the rampant homophobia of the 90s. Friends leans fully into it, with all the characters unabashedly making gay jokes. When Seinfeld did the same topic, they added ‘not that there’s anything wrong with it.’ The characters are aware they’re in the wrong on Seinfeld and on Friends they are not aware they are."
Thomas and Friends,Friends is living single for white people. Seinfeld is very good but dated and doesnt resonate with gen z like friends does. The real GOAT 90s sitcom will always be Frasier.
Thomas and Friends,"Friends. When was the last time you saw Seinfeld bath salts for sale?

Friends is the ultimate American style sitcom, while Seinfeld is a B+ approximation of a British style sitcom (which is why it never had an impact there). Friends is a huge global property and I guarantee at least one episode is screening on TV somewhere as you read this. Seinfeld not so much. What’s up with that? Could it *be* any clearer?"
Thomas and Friends,"Jerry this is frank, mr steinberger is here, George is dead, call me back.

This line alone is better than friends"
Thomas and Friends,Friends has a better looking cast and is a brighter show. Those things always age better as comfort watches.
Thomas and Friends,Sienfield is much better.
Thomas and Friends,From reading the comments it looks like I’ll be binge watching Seinfeld . 😊
Thomas and Friends,Workaholics… I said what I said.
Thomas and Friends,"Seinfeld is 10000x better than Friends. Even when Friends was on tv it wasn’t very funny. Seinfeld works because it deals with very real everyday themes but through the experiences of intentionally unlikeable characters. It’s about the discomfort of social interaction, the perpetual adolescence encouraged by urban life, the mundaneness of most work, the sheer amount of luck involved in finding jobs, family relationships… Friends characters tried to be likeable but were totally unbelievable because of it. They’re all beautiful and fashionable, whereas the cast of Seinfeld is fairly average looking (well Elaine is gorgeous but she dresses in a very particular way and has naturally curly hair and her real nose etc). Friends characters had mostly low paying jobs but rarely talked about money, whereas Seinfeld had entire episodes about finding good deals on rent. George had to move in with his parents when he was unemployed. It just feels more relatable. The fat Monica jokes on friends are really tasteless and cruel. Jokes about George Constanza being portly and bald feel very human—his value is not fully attributed to his attractiveness, he still dates and gets laid, and when women reject him it typically has more to do with his personality and poor behavior than his appearance. Friends was accused of being too white for NYC but I don’t think ever responded to that. Seinfeld, with the same accusation, made a hilarious episode about George trying to find a Black friend to prove he wasn’t racist. The writing in Seinfeld is just…excellent. I could go on and on about it, but I think it’s no contest at all. Friends was a blah sitcom that aged poorly. Seinfeld was an excellent sitcom with great writing, and while some jokes don’t make sense with current technology (eg stealing answering machine tapes), it doesn’t really matter."
Thomas and Friends,"I feel like FRIENDS has aged a tiny bit better. Let me explain.


FRIENDS is a show about a group of friends going through life, from early 20s to real adulthood with complicated relationships, kids, etc. A ton of the writing still holds up IMO. The negative of the show is that its VERY typical sitcom. A bit formulaic, especially in later seasons. But we do get to see the characters grow, develop, without compromising TOO much on what made them funny. Joey and Feebie are probably the only 2 characters that suffered a ton of Flanderisation.

SEINFELD on the other hand has MUCH sharper writing and the humor is a lot more nuanced. Where SEINFELD drops the ball is that its very much a product of its time. Half of the show would not work if the characters had smartphones. Simple as that. I mean, come on dudes, there is a whole episode revolving around swapping the cassette of an answering machine. 

This is all objective in my opinion tho. I personally enjoyed Seinfeld humor a lot more. Some of the jokes take a whole episode to be set up, with a payoff as the last line of the episode. That's not easy to pull off. And this is from a guy who grew up on Friends when it was airing. I only caught SEINFELD on Netflix. Also, George Costanza is a spirit animal and one of the most glorious characters to ever grace a TV screen"
Thomas and Friends,Always sunny in Philadelphia
Thomas and Friends,"Friends, simply because I never really cared for Seinfeld."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Not enough Joe Cornish projects, hope this is good"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"""In London, the most talented teenage ghost-hunters journey nightly into dangerous combat with deadly spirits. Among the many adult-staffed corporate agencies, one small startup is alone: Lockwood & Co, operated by two teenage boys and a psychically gifted girl who are a renegade trio free of financial motives, adult supervision and destined to unravel a mystery that will change history's course.""

Didn't know this show exists. Sounds as fun as Attack the Block and hopefully as good. Netflix horrors is spot on."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Big fan of the books, and Joe Cornish is great, Attack The Block is a cult classic. Can't wait to see this."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Sounds fun. I'll check out anything Adam & Joe are involved with.

Plus it has Ben Crompton in who should appear in more stuff!"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Joe Cornish? I'm in.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"So ""Live Boy Detectives""?"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"- Wait WHAT! Pantheon got canceled 😭. That should was amazing IMO. So what happens to S2 that was produced already.
- I liked Inside Job but not really upset it got canceled.
- Velma needs to be canceled. Just garbage. Never disliked a series so quickly."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Probably nothing beyond a bit of refocusing with what goes where, Cartoons have been getting cancelled since they've been on TV. Today's Pantheon and Infinity Train is last decade's Generator Rex and Symbionic Titan. Good shows will sometimes get their run, good shows may sometimes not.

Edit: I always feel like people forget this, but Gravity Falls was created with just two seasons in mind specifically because of how often cartoons were cancelled. It was just way less noticeable when shows were episodic so they'd simply just end and the creator wasn't on twitter to talk about not getting renewed."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Farzar.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Virtually every one of these new adult cartoons are incredibly bad. I like animated shows and want to like them but it is painfully obvious why they are getting cancelled.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Honestly, it seems like the streaming bubble is bursting, thus the implosion at HBOMAX, and multiple critically acclaimed series being cancelled at all American streaming services. It’s hard to predict the status of any type of scripted series (reality shows are cheaper to produce).

On the other hand, streaming services global reach has funded animation production from all over the world. Netflix has adaptations of comics from the Philippines, Korean Webtoons, and Chinese novels, Irish animated films and French series. Japan is producing more anime than ever because of funding from international streaming markets. 

American studios Titmouse and Frederator have a few shows in production, if I understand correctly. Video game adaptations are becoming more popular (Arcane got a lot of acclaim). 

Invincible and Vox Machina have been renewed for multiple seasons. 

Animated spinoffs of major American properties like Star Wars and Star Trek seem to be doing pretty well (I quite liked Star Trek Prodigy, personally. Lower Decks is more of a mixed bag, but not bad).

I think there’s reason for animation fans to be optimistic, but there will be a lot of bumps as streaming services figure out their finances going forward."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I can see a small movement away from established streaming services, and an increase with self published cartoons (like on YouTube)."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"i just hope they stop ""reinventing"" popular characters around low effort ""diversity"" ideas.

make original stuff that has diversity, dont reboot a show thats was popular a decade ago for specific reasons and then take out those reasons in an effort to modernize them."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"There is a future in American animation, and it is strong.

And some of the biggest additions to American animation will most likely come from companies you've never heard of."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Season 30 of family guy, mediocre marvel content and more batman."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I don't have any hope for the visual medium of story telling moving forward if I can be honest. 

Studios/Streaming services have learned that people are still gonna pay monthly fees to watch the garbage they put out. They have no incentive to change because if it's garbage, there's outrage and memes and it drives people to talk about it, going viral. If it's good then a bunch of people automatically hate it for taking over their feeds, outrage..memes. full circle. 

Studios ain't gonna take on original properties unless they can grab actors that have attached fan bases to them.
(Oh that chris Pratt has x amount of followers on IG, he's perfect to advertise our movie to a good demographic,  he's hired) 

Movies and animation are no longer propelled by its actual content,  but by the content it can generate on social media."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,[deleted]
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Yeah so they are completely canceling Pantheon from everything I've seen so far. [Here's the link](https://deadline.com/2023/01/pantheon-scrapped-amc-1235214158/amp/). They're doing what Warner Brothers did with a lot of their unreleased IPs where as long as they never marketed them in any way, they can just not put out the finished product and write it off on their taxes. Warner Brothers never releasing the Batgirl movie is a great example of this tax tactic. It's absolutely infuriating, though, because there is a finish season 2 out there but we will never get to see it"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Can you give some examples of shows you tried and didn't enjoy? I'm curious if we had any different experiences with any of them. I know on some my tastes are more forgiving than others, especially on comedic animation and shows that are appealing to younger audiences, but shows like Primal and Pantheon genuinely blew me away, Pantheon especially so.

I'm gonna gush a bit but it was based off short fiction by one of my favorite authors and explored topics that felt relevant and frightening in an approachable manner."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"This is the way. There are people working tirelessly, right now, on making ""product"", ""content"", call it whatever.

Most may be junk, but eventually, something will stick. But it will come from the independent scene. 

It's possible some Renaissance may come from major studios. But major studios are not producing good track records as of late, regardless of the medium or genre. Live-action, animation, you name it."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,">dont reboot a show thats was popular a decade ago for specific reasons

Having a mainly white cast...?"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Very true, I see this as one of the prime reasons for the shift from professional voice actors to celebrities in voice roles; Lion King was a great example of this and it mostly leads to these celebrities phoning it in for the money then genuinely being invested in the project"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"That is true for Disney. I really enjoyed Amphibia and Gravity Falls but I was distraught over their treatment of Owl House and their obsession with live action remakes of old IPs. I did think it was very satisfying to watch them realize how popular the last season of Owl House was after they drastically shortened it's lifespan but that's just another example of how popular something can become if you give it time to grow, which I'm nervous bigger studios aren't as committed to now. I do like the Pixar animation but I found myself less and less invested in the stories being told as I've gotten older. 

I do love Cartoon Network, they gave us so many good shows, but I don't know if something like Over the garden Wall or Steven Universe would get greenlit/long lifespans currently (I think how they treated Close Enough is a great example of their current behavior) and I'm frustrated that the show they probably put the most effort into recently was Teen Titans Go, a show where one episode was specifically dedicated to how none of the male characters could get anything done because they were too busy getting turned on by Raven's legs 🤢😵."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I had just started pantheon and was on episode 4 when it disappeared :(  They could have at least warned it was going away.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I tried inside job and thought it was a really cool premise but they did really bad on the execution of it, disenchanted again seems like it could have been decent but the actual dialogue and writing sucked, I tried that one tuca and Lola or something like that and was not a fan. Velma was one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. Paradise PD I also wasn’t a fan of.

I haven’t seen pantheo so I can’t say how that was but I will say primal was good. I didn’t love it in the sense that I’m not a huge fan of the no talking thing but I could tell there was real quality there and did enjoy episodes. It’s not something I can binge watch but every once in a while I go back to it for another episode. Amazon also has decent ones with invincible being really really good and vox machina being half way between mediocre and good. Pretty much all the Netflix and HBO ones that I’ve seen are pretty awful with the exception of primal though."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I was watching it on high dive but you could probably just pirate it

Also it's based off of a collection of stories by Ken Liu  called ""The Hidden Girl and other short stories"" if you want to keep reading the source material"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Honestly it sounds like we mostly have similar tastes.   I really can't stand TV with shock factor as a major element so most of what Netflix put out wasn't my cup of tea and I feel like Big Mouth really set a weird standard a lot of TV tried to emulate. Also I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought Paradise PD wasn't just a dumpster fire. 

But I think your reply really hits the nail on the head of my feelings that US animation, currently, is mostly just seen as a medium for kids, comedy, and superheroes. Good shows can still emerge from those fields (Futurama is my favorite example for comedy, Over the Garden Wall for kids, and Invincible for superheroes) but I don't care for the kids shows anymore and most of the comedy isn't as smart as some of my favorite Futurama moments."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Thanks
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Thanks to this show, The Last of Us and The White Lotus I watched Murray Bartlett have gay sex three times in a month."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I watched the ""Chippendale Murders"" True Crime show (can't remember what channel it was) 
So I was familiar with the story

But the Hulu show was EXCEPTIONAL."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I like how it was important to you that internet strangers knows you're straight:

>I didn't know anything about the backstory of chippendales

""*wait, what if someone who has no idea who I am thinks I'm gay?""*

>I didn't know anything about the backstory of chippendales **as a straight guy.**

*""Whew, that was close""*"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Such a great intro too!!
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I enjoyed the show, but one thing that bugged me was that Kumails performance made us almost feel sorry for the character."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"If you enjoyed that, Curse of the Chippendales is pretty good. It's a documentary about all that happened."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"The show kinda sucked tbh. The first 3/4 episodes were great but after that they changed some stuff and left a lot of stuff out. Am I the only one who felt like there's an episode missing. The transition from episode 7 to 8 is what I'm referring to. There are 2 great mini series documentaries about it you should watch to get the whole picture, one of them also features Steve Banarjees son(he never had a daughter I don't know why they changed this detail)"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Do they show a lot of dicks in this show?
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"i enjoyed what I watched, but at the same time I also kind of lost interest in finishing it as well."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,After getting disappointed with the outlaws and the consultant will give this one a try
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I mean I knew part of especially the end of Dan Stevens character considering his character grew up in B.C so but I had no idea Paul was was an early partner of Steve
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,He just loves to have gay sex.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Murray Bartletts in it I’m sold
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Holy shit how did I not realize that was him. Recognized him instantly as the hotel manager from White Lotus when he popped up in TLoU but never crossed my mind for Chippendales.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Same. I somehow watched all these one after the other without even knowing who he was. I felt like he was following me around on my tv.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"As someone who does not enjoy having a penis in or around my mouth, I liked this comment."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Just to clarify.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Seems like you're the one making it ""important"", they wrote 4 whole words pointing out they're not the target demographic of Chippendales

Now, we're on a main sub so yeah, kinda just assume commenter are all straight white guys, but still, no need to mock him. 

I fucking **wish** we had more people willing to check out shit outside their demographic on here, everytime I see a new movie or show aimed at anyone other than an 18 to 34 straight white male, the comments absolutely *flip their shit*"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"To be fair knowing that it was appealing to a straight guy makes me want to see it, and I’ve never heard of it"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,YES
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I think that was the intent
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,He did nothing wrong.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,What are you talking about? He had a daughter and then a son.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,May I recommend HBO’s LOOKING?

DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Yeah, that's the point dude."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"“One of the most groundbreaking shows I’ve ever seen, 7/10.”"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I loved the first few episodes, but they rushed to slap together an “Avengers-level event” for her to defeat that ended up being pretty lame. I would’ve loved to see more of her day-to-day family life and trying to thwart a few “street level” crimes and whatnot. That said, I get that they had a lot about the character that they wanted to establish with only 6 episodes, but the pacing was kinda bad in the latter part of the season. I’d still put it at an 8/10 though just because of how much I liked the character and her family/adolescent struggles."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"My father, who just recently passed, was a geography teacher and when we were kids every once in a while he would bring home some of the films he showed in class and one of those was Blue Men of Morocco.  It was a travelogue style film but I always was curious about the difference in cultures and that was one of the starts and Ms. Marvel took me back to that time.

Ms. Marvel as well as Wandavision and Hawkeye were my favorites on the Disney package."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I like how >!Zoe ends up nice the entire time with Kamala  having been more of a bully.!<
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"If you like the show, I would recommend the first run of the comics. The show gets everything the comic put out right. Kamala is just a loveable character. She is the adorable geeky little sister that everyone wants. MCU lucked out with finding Iman Vellani to play her. She was born to play the role."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,It took me to the second paragraph to realize I had misread the title and this wasn't about Ms. Maisel.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I thought the show started off really slow but finished strong.  Do I think it is ""groundbreaking?""  No.  But that is pretty much my opinion on all shows / movies."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I thought the time traveling was weird.  Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson.  We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures.  I just want to see powered people fight.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"It probably is groundbreaking in terms of providing a realistic portrayal of pakistani-american culture to a mass audience. Groundbreaking in the art form of making good TV shows, probably not."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"""groundbreaking"" doesn't have to necessarily mean 10 out of 10 to be honest."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,He's probably a reviewer from 7GN*.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,It has flaws but it does feel like a gigantic step forward. You can really like something but be aware it has problems. Ms. Marvel gets so much right that while it does has some issues but those issues weren't enough for me to hate it. But I also can't say it's perfect.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"You can tell at what point where the showrunner told the story they wanted to do and where Fiege came in to make the show fit in with the rest of the MCU. Because the Jersey part was so alive and well thought out. The Big Bad was almost an afterthought. Like you can hear the, ""Sigh....fine. Here are your MCU fight scenes. Now can we get back to Jersey already?"""
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,They should have deleted the weird Clandestines storyline and made Damage Control the true villains instead.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I'm definitely considering it now. Is there an app that has all the old marvel comics?
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,The fact that Spidey is a New Yorker is a *huge* part of the character.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,">Too much of the show was a history/culture/religion lesson. We don't spend most of the time on iron man or spider man getting into any other their backgrounds or cultures. I just want to see powered people fight.

Um...okay. 

It's a show about a Pakistani American Muslim superhero. What made of that made you think we wouldn't at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,How dare they expose you to other cultures and religions!!
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"But 7/10 ain't ""groundbreaking"" at all lmao"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I mean wouldent that atleast warrant a 8 or 9.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,It's like why do these superheroes have to use super powers? Just focus on a teenage girl and her real life struggles not some comic book powers
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,I mean they were. Kamala beat the aliens with TNJ
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Marvel Unlimited.

10 bucks a month, IIRC.

You'd be looking for the 2014 and 2015 series. 19 issues for 2014, 38 for 2015, I believe it was."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,That's just a setting.  We don't focus on Jersey in ms marvel.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"""at least be getting some insight into her personal life and background?""

Some is different from it being the main focus.  We don't get much from Fury, Rhody or Sam.  

I don't assume all Asian characters will get magically teleported into a history lesson ."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,So you thought the time traveling back to old Pakistan via powered bracelets was a natural consequence of the story?  I found it weird.  It's so different from the other marvel projects.  I'd find it just as odd if spiderman wasted time going to church and teleporting back to the war of 1812 for a history lesson.  I liked Kamala and look forward to seeing her in the marvels but just found the show to be a bit of a bore.  The love quandranle was a bit YA for me.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Not necessarily. I don't like the first Black Panther or Get Out very much. Both are a solid 5 for me. But I'm also very aware of how they broke new ground and pushed the envelope forward.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Thank you! That's very helpful!
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Man... it is absolutely not ""just a setting"" with Spider Man. He is about as culturally infused as a character gets, it's just a culture invisible to you because it's so familiar."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,Did you not Sam's show? His entire story arc was about reckoning America's past with the future that he is supposed to be sent to take up the mantle for. The series pulls from actual Black history like the Tuskegee experiment. If anything this is what makes these projects a lot more interesting than just a bunch of roided dudes punching each other.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"> So you thought the time travelling back to old Pakistan via powered bracelets was a natural consequence of the story?

Yes."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Your scale seems really weird.

A 5 is a movie on the line between being worth watching and not.

A good movie that has some issues is like an 8"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Also, if you are an American with a library card, you can download hoopla. That will link you up to your local libraries where many of them have Marvel titles online for you to read. Doing so will support your local libraries and, plus, it's free."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,New york isn't familiar to me.  To say that new york or chicago are cultures the same way being Muslim is a culture seems asinine.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I thought it had a bunch of weird mixed messaging.  It brought up racism a few times but didn't have anything to say about it.

They have Sam defend someone who murders innocent children saying ""she's not a terrorist, we need to think about why she was upset"" but the show didn't establish what the government was doing wrong."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"What, in the story, set up the possibility of time travel?  Did anyone think, before it happened ""Yep, the story naturally sets up that she'll be magically teleported into the past""? 

Do you just expect every character to get sent to the past and get disappointed 99.99999%$ of the time?  Were you upset that Shang's magic rings didn't send him back?

&#x200B;

You are so disingenuous."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"""A 5 is a movie on the line between being worth watching and not.""

depends on the scale.  True for 0-10.  I've rated thousands of films on IMDB which uses a 1-10 scale, so there's no middle score.  To me 5 is a tiny bit bad, not worth watching.  6 is good enough to say I like it.  I like that I never straddle a line"
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"I can recognize if something is really swinging for the fences and going for something big but it not really landing the way it intended. For example, Eternals is a movie I personally love but I can see why others couldn't. It has some pretty large flaws that I'm willing to address but overall that doesn't make me enjoy it less. But I can't give it an 8 or 9 simply because I liked it. There were things that bothered me but I can also recognize that it's trying to go for something new. It's a mixed bag. Ms. Marvel, especially in the first half, was a pretty enjoyable experience for me that was both unlike and similar to what I've seen before. The biggest problems come towards the middle but it brings it back to focus towards the end. I really love what they're doing for most of this but there are parts that upon a rewatch I'll just fast forward through. A 7 seems fair to me."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Because Islam is a religion, not a culture."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,">> What, in the story, set up the possibility of time travel?

The one that cracks me up the most is Bruno dressing like Marty McFly in episode 2, but the most relevant clues would be the constant references to past events. Nearly every episode (with 2 and 4 having the strongest connection) references Kamala’s family history in some way.

With that being said, I DID exaggerate my response a little. Sorry about that. The **natural** thing to expect here, given all the references, would be a detailed flashback sequence, which is exactly what we got. Time travel just happens to be one way to visually do such a flashback."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic\_culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_culture)

&#x200B;

You don't think religions have cultures?  I can't tell if you agree or can't follow the point.  I don't think putting spider man in Chicago changes much.  He's in Europe for the 2nd film.  Changing Kamala to a Mississippi Christian would change her completely."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"The point I’m trying to make is that a religion and a culture are not the same thing. Of course nothing changes when you put Spider-Man in a different culture, culture doesn’t directly change his character. But making Kamala, let’s say a Christian changes things MASSIVELY because you change her religion, which is core to her as a character."
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,That was my point to the other guy too.  To compare Kamala's religion to spiderman's setting is asinine.
DreamWorks Spooky Stories,"Ah, my bad, read the situation wrong."
Zig and Sharko,"Season 1 is good. Really sets the scene and lets you know what the characters are all about

Season 2 was pure insanity. The last few episodes were just plain wild. I sincerely hope there’s a season 3"
Zig and Sharko,"You’re not alone. Loved it, and hope someone rescues it for a third season (or more)."
Zig and Sharko,"The showrunner also did Banshee, another fantastic Cinemax show. I can't strongly recommend Warrior enough to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. While there presently won't be a Season 3, producer Justin Lin says that if enough interest is shown by people watching it now that it's on HBO Max it could open up discussions to continue the show."
Zig and Sharko,"It's very good. Just watch it dude. Tons of action, good acting and strong storyline."
Zig and Sharko,I'm watching it cause someone else in here suggested to watch it. The show is awesome.
Zig and Sharko,"I wasn't surprised by it at all because the same creative team was behind Banshee, which was another Cinemax show that was way better than it had any right to be. 

In fact, it was a real shame that Cinemax never got that breakout show that could establish the network. Nearly everything they did (Banshee, The Knick, Quarry, and finally Warrior) was quality. 

I really hope that HBOMax picks up Warrior for a third season, because what else they got?"
Zig and Sharko,Yes amazing show
Zig and Sharko,[deleted]
Zig and Sharko,"The action in the show redeems Brett Chan, the fight coordinator and second unit director. He was fired from Iron Fist season 1 because producers blamed him for the poor action. It was bs, because they didn't give him the time to train the actors, and the lead actor refused to take extra time to be trained by him and his team. Brett was responsible for the action in ""Marco Polo"" as well, which had really good action scenes."
Zig and Sharko,I loved it and want to see more.
Zig and Sharko,[deleted]
Zig and Sharko,"I felt like I was the only one! It feels way more grown up than I was expecting it to be. The action is great, the drama is well paced out for the most part, and I love the characters. I really hope HBO Max picks it up for a 3rd season"
Zig and Sharko,[removed]
Zig and Sharko,Someone NEEDS to pick this show up for three more seasons.
Zig and Sharko,"One of the best shows on TV, top production, cast and amazing action. Hoping for a season 3"
Zig and Sharko,"Yup. Definitely a surprise hit in my house. Hadn't heard of it, stumbled upon it on HBO Max, and was hooked after checking out the first couple of episodes.  I really do hope that HBO picks it up for another couple of seasons."
Zig and Sharko,"You late to the game!
But I'm glad you made it, I've loved this show from the Cinemax debut!"
Zig and Sharko,"Season 1 was certainly no Banshee in terms of storytelling, but still an enjoyable action series. Season 2 expanded everything and it was so so good. I hope someone picks it up because the writers were obviously just getting started."
Zig and Sharko,[deleted]
Zig and Sharko,Does Andrew Koji's character straighten up his posture? I'm having a hard time watching him hunched over the 1st episode. Does the acting get any better in Chinatown? I had my hopes up so I'm hoping acting and everything else gets better.
Zig and Sharko,I NEED MORE!
Zig and Sharko,"Don't assume, makes your life a lot easier and less hateful."
Zig and Sharko,I was so against it cause I hate Bruce Lee's work being stolen but it's pretty good.
Zig and Sharko,"All the Cinemax shows are moving to HBO Max slowly but surely, C.B. Strike also got added the other day. That one is a BBC co-production but I think they're testing the waters to see if Warrior will be renewed for season 3."
Zig and Sharko,"Thought the first episode looked really neat but it just wasn't edited well - it really dragged though the last half, we were just tired of watching it ten minutes before it ended."
Zig and Sharko,"I really hope they would give us more seasons. At the very least, if anyone on HBO managed to grow some brain cells, make a few movies, a trilogy of Warriors movie to close up the storyline. HBO should move a ton of quality content from Cinemax to HBO Max, and not waste all those investment. They have tons of quality content that could compete with Netflix and Disney, if only those suits can stop bickering and start printing money and gain more subscribers."
Zig and Sharko,I ignored this show ever since it came out because I thought it was just a straight up martial arts action show with no real plot but HOLY SHIT is this show awesome! I decided to check it out based on how many reddit posts I saw about it. I just watched season 1 episode 5 in the saloon in Nevada and I am just blown away!
Zig and Sharko,Its amazing
Zig and Sharko,Omg it's complete rubbish! Come on! It tries oh so hard to be uber cool. Every character makes me cringe. The dialog is first class though. First class trash! The fighting. Oh my. Bruce is turning in his grave! I had to go watch Dragons Forever to cleanse after giving it a couple of episodes. Benny the jet is the man! This is NOT what Bruce penned.
Zig and Sharko,Seriously. The Nevada episode and border episode were so good.
Zig and Sharko,"I watched the first episode and felt like the characters were pretty much stereotypical roles (partying son of gangster, henchman #1 that feels slighted by hero, policeman that is reluctantly corrupt, ...). Do they get more complex as the show moves on?"
Zig and Sharko,It's renewed for season 3 as an Hbo Max original
Zig and Sharko,"Is there the chance for that? I signed the Change petition but who knows if that works.

Justin Lin seems to think there’s a chance ... https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21"
Zig and Sharko,"That's why I kept seeing the building/business with Banshee on the front of it in some episodes.

I thought it was weird how it always stuck out in some scenes."
Zig and Sharko,Did 2nd season end in a cliffhanger?
Zig and Sharko,I hope so!!
Zig and Sharko,Haha did you read my post? I watched it all!
Zig and Sharko,Oh nice! Did you watch it on HBO Max?
Zig and Sharko,I’m really surprised I never heard of it until HBO Max. I did hear about the other two.
Zig and Sharko,I didn’t know Quarry originally aired on Cinemax. It’s been on my to-watch list since I found out it is set in Memphis which is where I’m from ha
Zig and Sharko,"“I think we spend every day living in their world. Today, they're going to die in ours.”

So cheesy but fuck yeah Young Jun tell em!"
Zig and Sharko,The fight scenes are AMAZING. So well done — always at the edge of your seat.
Zig and Sharko,Did you watch on Cinemax or HBO Max? Hopefully the numbers are good on HBO Max
Zig and Sharko,I really wish I could wipe my mind and watch the episode you are about to watch again.
Zig and Sharko,I know — I’m assuming you also found it on HBO Max. What made you decide to watch? Someone from work mentioned it ... otherwise I kept skipping it on the home screen.
Zig and Sharko,I thought I was the only one too! Here’s hoping for a third season. I guess we gotta let HBO Max know ... https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,Agreed! One of the best the genre has offered EVER
Zig and Sharko,AGREED. I just let HBO know (from the co-creator Justin Lin) https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,Gah I knowwww - the EP/co-creator says we gotta tweet HBO https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,Same - we’re shocked at how well written it is! We just let HBO know they have to save the show https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,i’m glad i did too! hopefully we get more
Zig and Sharko,I know! Bummed it seems COVID has taken another great show. Justin Lin (exec producer) says we gotta reach out to HBO https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,haha 1000% - i had no idea of any of those things when i saw it pop up on hbo max - seemed like there was a big chance it’d be dumb. boy was i wrong
Zig and Sharko,Def gets better
Zig and Sharko,moaaaarrrr
Zig and Sharko,"Lol, meanwhile, minutes ago:


> So this whole thread is about how shit fat people are and a bunch of assholes looking for excuses to complain about them?

> This whole thread is full of insecure cowards.



Seems quite a bit assuming and hateful to me."
Zig and Sharko,"It's not exactly stolen. His daughter, Sharron, is an executive producer and her company under his name is a production company (which is owned by the company his wife started, that Sharron now runs)"
Zig and Sharko,It's produced by his relatives and based on his writings.
Zig and Sharko,"You think? God, I wish we knew how popular it was on HBO. When I look at the hashtags on twitter it seems a lot of people are tweeting about it: https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21"
Zig and Sharko,Eh to each their own. We were hooked right away
Zig and Sharko,Yea - it requires long term thinking to consider you will make more money with a complete story than 2/3rds of one. Not sure they have what it takes. [But let’s let them know anyway!](https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21)
Zig and Sharko,"I thought the exact same thing — sad no one at HBO really gave it the chance it deserves. [I’ll still try to let them know it’s worth saving.](https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21)

And yes - that episode made me realize it was a special show."
Zig and Sharko,"Yes it was

LMAO, you obviously have no idea about what Bruce liked, this is the script HE thought of, what HE wanted, they've only minor changed most of the stuff."
Zig and Sharko,"those 2 episodes are outstanding,  if all the series was about ah Sam and young Jun roaming around like that would be an awesome series too. but happy to get a season 3 in San Fran too"
Zig and Sharko,"Yes. 

I honestly outright did not like episode 1 and 2 beyond the choreography, the setting, and the basic plot, love the show though."
Zig and Sharko,"IMO It's a typical Bruce Lee the Hero film and I love those Bruce Lee movies as a kid, so Warrior is a gem for me."
Zig and Sharko,"It doesn't tie it all up in a neat bow. The finale is certainly setting up stories for season 3, some things are left up in the air and other things are in motion, but ultimately the way some arcs and stories culminated left me fairly satisfied with how it ended if that were to be the end."
Zig and Sharko,I guess i misread the title.
Zig and Sharko,Yeah. The whole Cinemax Original series on HBO thing is odd but whatever.
Zig and Sharko,The camera work and editing works with it as well. No over editing and shaky cam.
Zig and Sharko,Can't remember how I watched season 1 but I watched season 2 on Max.
Zig and Sharko,[deleted]
Zig and Sharko,Tweet done. I've been upvoting every Warrior post and commenting on each one in hopes of drumming up interest. I really hope we get more
Zig and Sharko,[deleted]
Zig and Sharko,They have stylised it to the point that it makes me cringe. The music. The 'cool' of it. Minor changed the notes? I'm sure they did a number on them original notes!
Zig and Sharko,"Loved those 2 bottle episodes. I wasn't a huge Young Jun fan at first, but he really grew on me. Definitely a highlight of the show. His arc has been fantastic"
Zig and Sharko,Actually I agree with this. The first few episodes paint most of the characters in stereotypical roles. They do eventually get more complex. Season 2 seems like they realized that was a big issue and took big steps to shake things up.
Zig and Sharko,Thanks!  I’ll move past the first 2 episodes.
Zig and Sharko,no worries 😉
Zig and Sharko,Haha well hopefully it becomes an HBO Max original! I’m gonna tweet to HBO https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,"And I love it, any director that uses shaky cam needs to fuck right off. I wanna watch TV not imagine what it's like to roll down a mountain"
Zig and Sharko,I feel like more people will watch there than on Cinemax
Zig and Sharko,Lol I get it! Well maybe enough people will tweet about the show to get it renewed ... from the co-creator: https://twitter.com/justinlin/status/1345836177782292480?s=21
Zig and Sharko,me too
Zig and Sharko,"Oh damn - read something about it being covid. it probably just poorly sourced.

Found this:

https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/how-the-launch-of-hbo-max-sidelined-cinemax-11592839882"
Zig and Sharko,"Its kind of funny, the disparity between Koji (Ah Sahm) and Tobin's (Young Jun) fighting skills is about the same as the disparity between Koji and Tobin's acting skills."
Zig and Sharko,"My pitch would be push through to episode 5, if you don't like it after that I get dropping it."
Zig and Sharko,Season 2 is leaps better than one in my opinion. They had to get through all the foundation so they could set up for the entertaining character arcs.
Zig and Sharko,"|I wanna watch TV not imagine what it's like to roll down a mountain"" HAH perfect description."
Zig and Sharko,I certainly hope so. Cinemax also had The Knick which was definitely not a great fit there but luckily it's returning for HBO
Zig and Sharko,"I wanted to watch it but wasn't gonna subscribe to Cinemax, but glad it is on HBO Max!"
Zig and Sharko,Agreed. Ep. 5 is where it really hit a nice groove
Zig and Sharko,Same. Have you watched yet? It keeps showing up on the popular section so I hope it’s finding an audience!
Zig and Sharko,not yet I just found out that it's on there from you
Zig and Sharko,Sweet! Def give it a shot!
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
My Babysitters a Vampire,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
My Babysitters a Vampire,This was a great read.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
My Babysitters a Vampire,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
My Babysitters a Vampire,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Delta state was the shit!
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Dragon Ball was on YTV
My Babysitters a Vampire,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
My Babysitters a Vampire,It was on both actually
My Babysitters a Vampire,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Gellar on Starring in a Buffy Reboot:

>""I am very proud of the show that we created and it doesn’t need to be done. We wrapped that up.”  

  
>“I am all for them continuing the story, because there’s the story of female empowerment. I love the way the show was left: ‘Every girl who has the power can have the power.’ It’s set up perfectly for someone else to have the power. But like I said, the metaphors of ‘Buffy’ were the horrors of adolescence. I think I look young, but I am not an adolescent.”"
My Babysitters a Vampire,"It would have issues because of the cast alone.

Spike and Angel's actors simply can't play immortal vampires anymore. Nicholas Brendan is probably completely unemployable until he gets some long overdue help. They already killed off Anya and Cordelia.

That's before you get into how like half the cast wants nothing to do with Whedon anymore and that Whedon himself is a major no go right now.

SMG, Hannigan and Trachtenberg are probably the only 3 you could realistically keep running with. Maybe Anthony Head. 

It might be interesting if you could get Noxon, Fury, and Espenson back in the writers room but that's probably the only chance it has."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"The buffyverse is an incredibly fleshed out and brilliant universe with a lot of potential 

Pick another slayer in another era and tell a different story completely unconnected from Buffy 

A period piece would be brilliant.

I’m surprised no one has done this yet"
My Babysitters a Vampire,Make a spinoff about the Hellmouth over Cleveland instead.
My Babysitters a Vampire,God I respect her so much for this. Not everything needs to be rebooted. Try and get some new ideas
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Agreed. It doesn't need to be done. 
This will unfortunately have absolutely zero bearing on whether it will in fact, be done."
My Babysitters a Vampire,and that's why we love her
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I mean she is 100% right.

Create a new show with a new slayer not named Buffy and not set in Sunnydale.

You get to have your own show and characters without pissing off the original fan base."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Lets be honest, we all know it would have sucked.  Hollywood does not respect any IP or the fans."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"The finale screamed for a subsequent anthology series. AHS style, following a different slayer in a different city (world wide) with periodic overlaps for team ups to face specifically big bads."
My Babysitters a Vampire,SMG doesn’t need cash. That’s good.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Half-joking with this but hear me out, instead of a Buffy reboot, we get a spin-off where Kendra gets brought back from the dead and the plot twist is that Bianca Lawson STILL plays her because she actually is a vampire IRL. She does not age."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Give us the Giles ""Ripper"" prequel you cowards."
My Babysitters a Vampire,We'll always have the Musical.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Buffy was a fun show and a vampire slayer mini-series could be good, too, if written well. You could have 10-episode seasons and focus on a different slayer. For example, I remember a scene that showed a kung-fu Chinese slayer from ages ago. It'd be a blast to watch her fight Chinese Ghost Story-type baddies."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Even if it did need to be done, why would you recast the old Buffy to be in the New Buffy? That's stupid."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Gotta respect someone for not rebooting something that already had worked and run its course.
My Babysitters a Vampire,I loved Buffy. I don't want any sort of reboot. I would however like some sort of continuation of the story with an entirely new cast. It's very well set up for exactly that. They could potentially grab SMG (or another original cast member) for one special episode- i doubt she'd say no to that. Could also potentially be an anime- easier to showcase all the magic and powers of the slayer (and bad guys) without breading the budget of what would otherwise be a (potentially) expensive show given all the needed special effects.
My Babysitters a Vampire,We do need answers to some burning questions like: aren't Angel and Spike corpse-cold to the touch? Does Buffy not retch from the reek of dried blood breath? You think kissing a smoker is bad.
My Babysitters a Vampire,She literally said no to money out of principle. You don't see that every day. Good for her.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"For the best

Lets face it Whedon might be an asshole but history shows

If he isnt in charge, stuff based on his work usually sucks"
My Babysitters a Vampire,Respect
My Babysitters a Vampire,Augustus St. Cloud howling at this statement.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Probably for the best. I love Buffy, but it ended almost 20 years ago and the story was pretty well wrapped up.

If anything it was Angel that had a cliffhanger ending, unless you read the follow up comics."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"The show WAS the reboot. 

It’s already been done, doesn’t need to be done again."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Wasn't her show a reboot of the movie?
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Another redditor once pitched the idea that Buffy is living a normal life and hides the fact she’s a slayer from her husband and kids. One days she takes out the trash and is attacked by a demon only for the scooby gang to show up to kill it. I’d love the take of grown Buffy coming out retirement or even being a watcher or something. It’d be cool if we could see a snippet of her life even if was just for an episode in a new story. However, I respect that she’s done.

Ripper would’ve been a great story."
My Babysitters a Vampire,I don't understand why they haven't/won't do an animated series. It could be so good.
My Babysitters a Vampire,This wouldn't happen without Wheedon. He's notoriously obsessive over this show and likes to be puppetmaster. No one would want to work with him again.
My Babysitters a Vampire,She’s such a queen 🤩
My Babysitters a Vampire,Already being made. It's basically what Wednesday is. Mythical monsters? Check. Teen girl who is just good at everything? Check. Bunch of other weirdos around her? Check. First bf turns out to be a maniac? Check. Etc etc
My Babysitters a Vampire,Thanks god for SMG
My Babysitters a Vampire,"***ReVAMP***, headline writers, ""Geller shuts down starring in Buffy revamp""!

For god's sake, it's right there"
My Babysitters a Vampire,"It really really, doesn’t need to be done.  Reboots are becoming an absurd meme of Hollywood, constantly playing the nostalgic angle and rarely succeeding to recreate the magic of original content.   Bringing things back to inject current social norms is also tiresome.  Goddamn. Where’s the creativity these days?  You know what I damn well mean!!!  There *has to be* new original content out there, probably sitting stagnant on some desk but won’t get green-lit bc of fear of not turning a profit."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Good for her for not taking this obvious cash grab. That show was just as much about Joss' scripts as it was the actors. I think everyone knows it would suck without Joss' writing.
My Babysitters a Vampire,She's 100% correct. We don't need a Buffy the Vampire slayer reboot. A Buffy TNG though could be interesting but it doesn't need to happen.
My Babysitters a Vampire," I dread a direct reboot just because they always seem to turn out like garbage.

Warrior Nun is legitimately the perfect spiritual successor to Buffy, in my opinion. Really hoping they get picked up because I'm hooked on the lore – *so* much potential."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"If there is money to be made, it will get done.

-any greedy Hollywood producer"
My Babysitters a Vampire,Sanity prevails.
My Babysitters a Vampire,Respect.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"100% don’t fucking reboot beloved, perfect tv shows. hope this show crashes and burns and the show runner who greenlit it"
My Babysitters a Vampire,Finally someone in with some sense... Reboots are generally not better than the originals and most of them don't need to be done. It's purely a profit-driven practice to milk the nostalgia of gen Xers and millennials.
My Babysitters a Vampire,This is true of all reboots…
My Babysitters a Vampire,Good on her for having the guts to say it
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I mean it all ended with dam comics, they didn't really finish it on TV, same with Angel"
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Sad as i am to say it, she's right."
My Babysitters a Vampire,This is the most rational news headline Ive seen in years.
My Babysitters a Vampire,It needs to be done because Hollywood is out of ideas and loves money.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Good, I absolutely agree.  It doesn't need to be done.  Want to watch more Buffy?  Just rewatch the show again, it's more than good enough.  Really want to know what happens after the end of the story?  Well, there's a comic series that picked up the story and was even written by Joss Whedon if you really must go that route."
My Babysitters a Vampire,It’s great being an 80s kid. I get to watch my younger years microwaved shows with awful writing and worse acting /s
My Babysitters a Vampire,Unpopular opinion: that show and universe is fine as it is. It doesn't need a reboot and it doesn't need a spin off.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Agreed. Enough with the reboots. Let's have the talented writers pitch original television/movies. 

Seems like the writers with original content are not being heard."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I'd like to see Gellar as the mom in a conventional teen drama centered around her kids as high school students doing TV high school student things... but every now and then you get a scene like Gellar washing her stakes and knives as the kids come home to tell her about their day. Strange events would occur - skies darkening, earthquakes, etc. - without any explanation and would just end up being resolved while the kids stress about making the cheerleading squad or their latest love triangle."
My Babysitters a Vampire,I have honestly never cared about this show at all.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I don't want season 8.  I don't want a remake either.  


But a story continuation in the same universe with different characters would be the sweet spot.  And that leaves the door open for the odd cameo should anyone wish to do it"
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I agree with the sentiment that we don't need a Buffy reboot, but if there was one why would Sarah Michelle Gellar be starring in it? She's 45."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"You could argue her Buffy show was ""a reboot that doesn't need to happen."" too. And it turned out to be pretty good after a rocky start."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I agree with her, do something new."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Haven’t heard anything from her in years, first thing is a shameless repudiation of reboot frenzy even though it may be financially lucrative. Lots of respect"
My Babysitters a Vampire,It also probably wouldn’t last more than a season in today’s environment.
My Babysitters a Vampire,The TV show WAS the reboot.
My Babysitters a Vampire,I would argue that as a society we're ready to be done with anything associated with Joss Whedon.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"I mean, the original Buffy didn't need to be done. So, good for her for growing up."
My Babysitters a Vampire,Cell phones would make that whole series 5 minutes long
My Babysitters a Vampire,"People crying for a sequel, reboot, anthology, whatever and then get surprised when Disney launches 15 shows in a year with the same IP. Just let things end with grace. Let new things pop up."
My Babysitters a Vampire,She must still be doing very well financially.
My Babysitters a Vampire,Buffy was an artifact of it's time.
My Babysitters a Vampire,The first series didn't need to be done either. No tv show or movie needed to be done.  Doesn't mean it won't be re done anyways
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Most reboots can fuck all the way off. The only legitimate reason to reboot, or remake something, is if the original was lacking in some way. I’m not a fan myself, but every single woman I’ve ever met absolutely loves Buffy, and would spit on the floor in disgust at the thought of a reboot, or anything that would retcon or diminish anything at all in that universe."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Once she sees that paycheck ""it absolutely needs to be done, they convinced me we'll do it right"""
My Babysitters a Vampire,FFS stop rebooting shit! Have an original fucking thought for once.
My Babysitters a Vampire,Also she’s no longer a high school teen so…
My Babysitters a Vampire,She’s always said no. She’ll never work with joss whedon again. He was too abusive.
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Glad she was real about it. It'd end up being total shit crammed with woke, shallow agendas that serve only as a checklist in an effort to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. Especially in this day and age where streaming services become more desperate.

I'm not saying a younger generation's adolescent experiences are somehow not significant enough or whatever (they have a whole new world of material that could be used) to match the OG show but rather studios today are so inept that it'd come off that way. It'd just be hollow."
My Babysitters a Vampire,"Isn't ""The Chosen One"" by definition, required to be a teenage girl? I thought ""Slayers"" aged out, or do they usually just die before they make it to adulthood?"
My Babysitters a Vampire,She already WAS in the reboot
My Babysitters a Vampire,thank god. That last season was rough enough
Dance Academy,"Dance Academy is a good show. It's probably better if you already enjoy watching dance shows/movies like Center Stage and Bunheads.

It's pretty comparable to ABC Family shows. The acting is okay (Dena Kaplan is good, though) and some of the plot points get tiresome, but overall it's enjoyable to watch."
Dance Academy,"Until Klaus yelled ""Get Him Luthor!"" I wondered if Marcus' ability was forcing a dance-off (forced mimicry, lol)"
Dance Academy,Feels like half of umbrella academy wouldn't be made at all if the characters just talked to each other before making decisions.
Dance Academy,I thought there was someone putting  a group hex on all of them.
Dance Academy,"The way Luther says ""Protecting our honor, bro"" cracks me up every time."
Dance Academy,I wasn't sure if I was going to watch season 3. I felt like maybe my Umbrella Academy journey was over. But I thought I'd give it a fair chance to change my mind...encountered this scene...binged the rest of the season in less than a day. So out of left field that they earned my attention.
Dance Academy,Fuck Allison.
Dance Academy,"We've got 5 fantasizing about what he desires (his store mannequin wife), does that mean the spit makes you hallucinate about what you want? Does that mean Diego wants a dance off? Like he wants to be silly and fun and irreverent?"
Dance Academy,"Weird seeing all the negative comments, I really enjoyed the 3rd season."
Dance Academy,"Best moment of season 3.

Looked so fun to film too"
Dance Academy,The cast must have had some fun doing this. Given later events it's a nice chill intro.
Dance Academy,"Music choices in this show are probably some of the best I've ever heard. 

Nice bit of foreshadowing 2 minutes in as well..."
Dance Academy,I love that they even use a lot of the original choreography/shots. Couldn’t stop laughing.
Dance Academy,Of course the first thing that came to mind was “Dance off Bro”
Dance Academy,I was hoping the went to a parallel universe where they settle their squabbles with dance battles. I was laughing my ass off at this. They really aren’t afraid to get crazy. Dance battle. Floating boxes. Mass hysteria!
Dance Academy,I am a huge Footloose fan. Between this and Hughies shirt in The Boyz I was in heaven this week.
Dance Academy,I lost it when that happened
Dance Academy,This season dragged a little bit but had so many bright shinny moments.
Dance Academy,"Screw the haters, this show is fun."
Dance Academy,I loved this. I was alone and jumped up started dancing. The best part of this was Grace doing the robot!
Dance Academy,"One of the best openings scenes to a new season. It was fun and made perfect sense, once we figured out it was a fantasy."
Dance Academy,"This entire scene felt really jarring, and ultimately had nothing to do with the plot. Just a weird side venture into a dance scene. It's fun, but also why did she spit on him if she wasn't going to attack him while he's hallucinating?

I'm convinced they only wrote the spitting character into the show for this scene and this scene alone. She dies like two episodes later having done nothing else of major importance.

Edit: If you don't want to be spoiled, don't go near discussions about the medium. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO AVOID SPOILERS."
Dance Academy,i loved that that's how they started the new season. perfect that both #1's just knew to start a dance off.
Dance Academy,"I started watching the new season with my partner, who had only seen bits and pieces of S1 and S2, and he literally just got off the couch and walked away without so much as a word when the choreography got underway. Poor fella had no clue about the (really cool) powers of the lovechild of Anne Hathaway and a lizard."
Dance Academy,"I haven't watched the new season, but I wanted to say that Luther's crab hands dance is one of the single greatest gifts from this entire series."
Dance Academy,I thought flash mobs are cancelled?
Dance Academy,i’ve watched this scene a dozen of times and started to dance along
Dance Academy,This season was just soooo bad i found myself hate-watching this show.
Dance Academy,"This occurs roughly 10 minutes into the first episode of season 3.

It is the high water mark of the season."
Dance Academy,"The first episode, especially this scene, was the only best thing about the entirety of S3 imo. It just felt so hollow afterwards."
Dance Academy,This is very stupid
Dance Academy,"Probably the only good moment in the first episode, watched the first two episodes and didn't have the motivation to watch the rest, the show is unfortunately getting way too repetitive"
Dance Academy,"Dammit.  Im such a sucker for a dance montage.

Bravo Umbrella Academy.  Bravo."
Dance Academy,"I like it when musical numbers pop up. Singing and dancing is fun and cinematic.

But, I stopped ep. 2ish, and not sure I care to go back."
Dance Academy,"I finished the second season feeling pretty unfulfilled, but couldn't place why.

I realised that every character in Umbrella Academy feels like they would prefer to be dead. Living is annoying or pointless. Felt pretty spot on."
Dance Academy,This scene was amazing.
Dance Academy,"This show and The Boys are singlehandedly carrying the superhero genre. Each shows is incredibly unique and fun, quirky and funny. One is more noir and mystery, the other is more thriller and satire.

Honestly...I'm so happy they both exist in such a watered down superhero era.

(And I love the MCU)"
Dance Academy,Ugh season 3 was a real stinker unfortunately
Dance Academy,I almost shut off the show when this happened. So cringe-inducing.
Dance Academy,These Breakfast Club moments are my least favorite part
Dance Academy,Good grief. This clip guarantees I won't be watching this show.
Dance Academy,"There is so much dancing this season. So much, lol."
Dance Academy,So happy I stopped this shitshow in season 2 seeing how it kept the quality to a minimum.
Dance Academy,That guy at the end looks like the lovechild of Dave Grohl and Dan Fogler
Dance Academy,"Almost turned it off because I thought this was so stupid, but then you see the reasoning and I was like, ok still dumb but I get it. Other than that the season has been fun."
Dance Academy,"I kinda get the vibe that the writers got drunk on the idea that this is ""The superhero show about family drama with dance numbers.""

The dance numbers in season 1 were nice, partially because they all felt like they made sense. By the time season 2 hit the dance scene in the salon, it felt like they just were making up excuses.

It feels to me like the writers did a good job with season 1, saw that people liked season 1, then didn't really understand what they did that actually made it good, so they're just trying to recapture whatever was there instead of building on their formula."
Dance Academy,"Sometimes, as with this scene, I *really* enjoy Umbrella Academy. Most of the time I'm though I'm just kind of bored."
Dance Academy,[deleted]
Dance Academy,"The first few were fun, but now it feels like they write these dance numbers in so that it ""goes viral"" or create clip moments.  
It does nothing to further the story except ""look how quirky these characters are."""
Dance Academy,"Just another example of a Netflix series that seems incompetently told. If your conflicts are annoying, you're doing it wrong."
Dance Academy,The dude on the right of the still for this video looks like Elon Musk bein his fabulous self
Dance Academy,"This show is so cringe.
Get your woke bs out of Hollywood already"
Dance Academy,"I’ve given a pass to a lot about this series but this was kinda the last straw for me, I couldn’t make it though the first episode"
Dance Academy,[removed]
Dance Academy,"I almost stopped watching, but luckily it wasn't serious. Just a hallucination. 

Unlike the dumpster fire of Guardians of the Galaxy 1, it's good to see other productions paying attention."
Dance Academy,forever obsessed with Allison's costume
Dance Academy,Probably the only scene I've really liked from what I've seen so far (episode 4) besides everything with 5
Dance Academy,"Haven't watched it yet, and not sure if I will. I enjoyed the first season, although didn't love it. But I thought season 2 was just bad."
Dance Academy,This was a great start
Dance Academy,That was so pointless and cringe.
Dance Academy,"What were Marcus powers, btw?"
Dance Academy,"""Save me Barry!"""
Dance Academy,Remember that episode of *Three's Company* when there was some sort of misunderstanding?
Dance Academy,"Feel like half of Umbrella Academy wouldn’t be made if Allison just used her powers and if Five fought at even ten percent of the capacity he showed in season one. 

Seriously the two of them could have butchered the sparrows without breaking a sweat. Imagine professor x being like haha what mind powers I’ll just fight with a cane."
Dance Academy,It's kind of the point tbh. Everyone is the Umbrella Academy are dysfunctional and maladjusted adults with heavy emotional baggage.
Dance Academy,"They don’t talk to each other because they never agree on anything lol 

The whole season would be them trying to agree on a plan."
Dance Academy,"They're much more worse in the comics. Like Jesus, fucking act like adults, sit around a table, and talk it out."
Dance Academy,"Isn't that like the entire premise of the show?  Spoilers for season 3: >!In the very first episode, 2 characters do just sit down and talk it out, and avoid a fight... until a weird energy blob eats one of them, and the other team thinks they were kidnapped!<"
Dance Academy,"I hope it's not the same in the 4th season. I really won't be able to stomach seeing them act like children again after going through 3 fucking apocalypses.

I mean it would have been ok if they were consistent but it's like their characters are also reset each season like ""Imma ignore what happened last season but not fully. Imma keep doing stupid shit, but not all the time."""
Dance Academy,This tends to be the same with a lot of tv shows! Just bloody talk to each other!!!
Dance Academy,"This is my biggest gripe with the show. I get that they're all traumatized and dysfunctional and that you can't tell a story without there being a conflict to resolve but it's just constant conflict due to no one wanting to talk to anyone about anything (while also constantly emphasizing how they're family and need to work together). It makes them all so hard to like. By the end of season 1, I was rooting for Vanya to finish them all off. And yet I still watch. I guess because since I started, I feel compelled to finish."
Dance Academy,100%. Also nothing breaks immersion for me like the seasons in modern times where there’s basically not a single cell phone. Which would all nullify 80% of the show’s plot.
Dance Academy,To be fair they did tell each other more this season but the other characters just ignored our didn't care which was pretty authentic to the characters
Dance Academy,"God,when they spent so long trying to get the suitcase when Five had it...so infuriating."
Dance Academy,"This season has been incredibly bad about this. Also the wedding nonsense might be worst TV ""romance"" I've ever seen. They have no chemistry as actors and they knew each other for like 2 days in the show and met each other like 3 time AND the world is ending in like a day. The wedding episode felt like an episode of a terrible sitcom. Not to mention the complete and utter assassination of Allison's character."
Dance Academy,"5 lecturing Victor about going off and making decisions on his own warranting *killing* him, *immediately* after going on his own side quest with Lila while everyone else fruitlessly scramble over an item 5 already has *which people got killed over and escalated the secondary conflict.*"
Dance Academy,I mean to be fair that sums up most television these days.
Dance Academy,"Yeah this alone makes me just skip through the episodes. I really don't like the bulk of the show, but I love the concept and the milestones through the story."
Dance Academy,And the other half wouldn't be made at all if characters stopped accepting spiked food and drink from their adversaries
Dance Academy,This is the solution to all dramas ever made period.
Dance Academy,Definitely thought their #1 had some sorta mirror/make you copy power
Dance Academy,My take was when either group was younger and more playful they all did a group dance thing (or the dad made them do for team building) that none of them ever forgot so in order to prove they were indeed the same but from different timelines they broke out the dance.
Dance Academy,"Shit, we're really good at this!"
Dance Academy,"I feel like Umbrella Academy is my favorite example of Style over Substance. It has a vague series of events that you might call a plot or a race against time, but it’s mostly just a bunch of lovable train wrecks doing lovable train wreck shit."
Dance Academy,It was instantly one of my favorite tv scenes of all time. I laughed out loud so hard my seventeen year old came to see what was going on and made me rewind then sat down and binged the season with me… she quit halfway through season one previously (but knew the summary).
Dance Academy,Season 3 was fucking gas
Dance Academy,"That's kind of my problem with the show.  It feels like it's trying so hard to be quirky that I just rolled my eyes when the dance-off started.  It feels like there's no purpose to any of the weird stuff, it's just packed with it to make it feel different."
Dance Academy,I was with you until after encountered this scene... I quit the series about 5 minutes later into this episode.
Dance Academy,Yeah she sucked this season. I liked her in the other 2 which makes this such a shame.
Dance Academy,My biggest issue with the season by far was how quickly they brushed off that she >!sexually assaults Luthor!< really  pissed me off
Dance Academy,Each season I forget why I hated her and go from liking her then remembering how awful she is.
Dance Academy,Allison this season is one of most insufferable characters I have seen since Iris and Felicity from The Flash and Arrow. Even when they tried to make Alison sympathetic she wasn’t at all.
Dance Academy,He wants one big happy family
Dance Academy,I can see that for him. He'd definitely want to bust out with Footloose parodies.
Dance Academy,"I was wondering that as well. The way Jayme raises her eyebrows at Diego it's almost like she knew what had happened in his mind the whole time, or maybe she even has a way to give people specific scenes when she spits. It would make her power more interesting."
Dance Academy,[deleted]
Dance Academy,Reddit hates fun.
Dance Academy,I enjoyed s3 but still felt it was worse than S1/S2. Some things didn't make sense and not too much was explained very well. Some wasted potential with the Sparrows too although I guess that's to be expected as exploring them further would take time away from the Umbrella academy
Dance Academy,Ngl I was more excited for Ms marvel’s first two epsiodes than this show’s first two eps. I don’t know if the quality went down or it was always like this because I remember really liking the first two seasons but nothing has captivated me so far about this one
Dance Academy,"It was fantastic from a plot writing point of view, pretty weak from a character point of view, and has always been somewhat weak from a dialogue point of view.

The plot was great. The foreshadowing of oblivion, the buffalo, Reginalds plan, etc. are all masterfully crafted. This is EXACTLY how you do a “omg the world’s going to end” storyline - make it about the characters and their motives, not about saving the world. There’s a reason why so many movies with massive scale disasters bring out zero emotion from people but when Spiderman beats his rival you feel giddy.

Characters were enjoyable but incredibly weak. Allison is the most obvious glaring issue as the entire season she acted completely out of character. Grief can do many things, but it doesn’t turn you into an evil person, and the whole “grief” angle was way overblown. Luther was way way too dumb (though I enjoy him on screen a lot). Five was way too dumb also, not piecing together things he should. Ben was comically villainous. The only really great characters this season imo were Reginald, Klaus, Sloan, and Diego’s gf (can’t remember her name). 

Not much to say about dialogue, it’s always been bad but I don’t knock it too much for that.

Overall I think it was a great season, and if they had made Allison more believable it would’ve been a tv favorite. Every time she was on screen I couldn’t help myself saying “who the fuck thinks that way?”"
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"
Les Revenants (The Returned): French supernatural series about the dead coming back to life (in a good way). Has a very Twin Peaks feel to it (small town, mysterious happenings, very slow with heavy emphasis on drama). 

Borgen - Danish version of The West Wing

Bron/Broen (The Bridge) - Brilliant Scandinavian crime drama, remade in the US as The Bridge on FX. IMHO the Scandinavian version is better. Very dark and gritty. 

Äkta människor (Real Humans) - Swedish show about a society heavily dependent on human-like artificial intelligence robots. 

English language but foreign:

Black Mirror - British anthology series. Pretty much The Twilight Zone in the 21st century. Lots of commentary about the role of technology in our lives. 

All of these series are currently airing. "

Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"Gomorrah.An Italian TV show about a modern crime family.Ciro,the main character is one of the most ambiguous character in modern telly."
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"I have no idea if it has a subbed or dubbed version, but *[Minuit, le soir](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446233/)* (*Midnight, in the evening*, weird name but it makes sense) is an awesome French show from Quebec. In Quebec, it achieved 1.3 million viewers on average in the first season. Relative to the population, this would mean about 60 million US viewers.

It's pretty hard to describe, since the premise is almost uninteresting: nightclubs, the daily grind of bouncers and the staff who work there. But the writing and directing are incredibly good. It's a dramedy revolving around 3 bouncers at nightclubs and the new owner (daughter of a mob-connected former bar owner). The score is also really great, especially the recurring cello lines.

It's emotionally pretty intense. It's character-driven and all the characters have depth and everything adds up to an experience that is sometimes amusing, other times disturbing.

A run-down of the characters may help sell it best. The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuit,_le_soir) has a good overview as well.

Marc (the main character) is a former navy officer with anger issues (who often sees a discount Romanian psychologist who is working as a janitor because his degree is not recognized), always chasing tail and unable to allow himself to be happy. He has an unfortunate streak of killing his pets (all on accident). He's a strangely moral character, fiercely loyal to his friends, for all his many personality flaws. He sheds a powerful light on what it means to work security in such an otherwise low-profile career. He's a real pro at a job nobody would think is of any importance.

Louis, a simple guy with sex issues (he can't do it unless disguised, which relates to his insecurities as a man), often getting in trouble (and showing his crack) and held straight by Marc.

Gaetan is older than the other two, been a bouncer his whole career. He tries to work around being unable to read, having difficulty seeing without his glasses (gotta look young and hip for the new owner). He ends up having a complex relationship with an escort half his age.

Fanny, the new owner of the clubs. Her father is pretty controlling and a traditional Italian who is unsure she has what it takes to succeed. She has to deal with an asshole manipulative (almost sociopathic, but again, a much deeper character than shows up at first) employee-boyfriend who almost toys with her and Marc simply because he can, biker gangs who want to set up shop in her clubs, etc.. Her brother is seemingly vapid and annoying but leads one of the most emotionally powerful story arcs. I've had *the feels* every time I watched one of the episodes with him where he... hum... disappears (don't want to spoil too much).

It's 37 half-hour episodes, but there is more character and story development on this show than in most 10 seasons full-hour shows.

The director (Podz) is top-notch (also directed another great show mentioned in the comments: Les Bougon). The social commentary is great (Louis works for city maintenance during the day, which makes for great satire). It's the most serious I can imagine comedy being while remaining funny. Lots of misery, pretty dark, but in many ways heart-warming.

The photography may be a bit offsetting at first, it's very grainy on purpose, especially since it's SD so the blacks look **very** grainy."
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"Prisoners of War, Israeli drama that was remade as Homeland. A lot slower than the US version but first rate drama. There's 2 seasons out so far and hopefully there'll b another next year"
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"[Odisseia](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2416936/)

It's Portuguese, and incredibly hard to find subtitled, if you know portuguese, here's a link to the first episode (the others are below): http://www.rtp.pt/play/p1039/e105555/odisseia


I think the DVD has subtitles but that's also very hard to find. Here's a link to a portuguese store, I don't know if it ships outside Portugal:
http://www.fnac.pt/Odisseia-Serie-Completa-DVD-Zona-2/a734645

According to the description, it has english subtitles.

It's a shame that's it's to hard to find, it's a very (*very*) meta comedy/drama story. It's hilarious and perfectly acted. It has like 3 layers, the writers, the crew, and the story itself.


Here's the only sample I could find with english closed captions (the show isn't stop motion, only this gag): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hKVehgzjvU

That isn't really what the show is abou though, it's a random side-gag

It also features some of the greatest gorilla acting ever (I'm not kidding, he might be better than Andy Serkis), you don't really need to know Portuguese for this:

It gets weird by the end though.

Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"[Unité 9](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388350/) is a great french-canadian show (mostly in canadian-flavoured french, but with a few smatterings of english) about a women's prison. Quite gritty and atmospheric."
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"I'll echo the Scandinavinoir suggestions. 

The Bridge (Bron/Broen) features one of my all time favourite relationships between two flawed individuals who realistically find they need each other whilst being refreshingly free of any sexual tension. 

The first series of The Killing (Fobrydelsen) is essential viewing for anyone who enjoys murder mysteries.

And Wallander is worth it for Krister Henriksson's portrayal of a very believably troubled detective that is free of the usual over-exaggerated brooding you'd see in U.S. sort of drama. 

Yeah, if you can tolerate how depressingly dark those Danes and Swedes make their drama then you should get watching the above."

Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"Borgen - It's a Danish political drama about about a fictional Prime Minister.

Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,Japanese Drama: Strawberry on the Shortcake.
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"**Wakfu.** An excellent young-adult show in French, set in the universe of an MMO. Has a start-middle and -end, superb villain, and beautiful animation style. 

Additionally, it is a little more adult in the interpersonal relationships and overall writing than a typical cartoon show, I think in large part due to its European origin.

It's a little bit like a French version of Avatar: The Last Airbender, but with a much more tongue-in-cheek sense of humor throughout. No fewer feels at the finale though.

It's available on Netflix now but their subtitles suck. (They included closed-captioning for things that don't need translation, in addition to taking liberties with idioms and game-specific references. Handy if you are deaf I guess, don't mean to be exclusive.)  Look instead for the fansub torrent, an exemplary labor of love."

Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"I've recently gotten into K-Dramas.  I'm really enjoying the single-season format that most of the shows follow.  It really forces the shows to be well packaged and fast moving, rather than slow and meandering like many American dramas.  In the same way that K-Pop has become incredibly influential in Asia, K-Dramas are spreading like wildfire in China.  Seoul is set to be the Hollywood of Asia.  Here are a couple of highlights-

**City Hunter**: Action/Drama starring Lee Min-Ho (basically the 20-something DiCaprio/Damon of Korea) based on a Japanese Manga.  Somewhere between The Bourne Identity and Batman.  Hero-driven revenge series.  No superpowers or ridiculous technology, but plenty of martial arts and espionage.  Bad guys are realistically corrupt politicians and CEOs.  Good guy is more interesting in publicly ruining them using their own vices than actually killing them.  

**You Who Came From the Stars**: RomCom/Drama.  This was the show that originally peaked my interest in K-Dramas.  There was an article in The Economist a couple years ago that talked how the Chinese Politburo was so frustrated that this show was so successful in China and that the Chinese weren't capable of making something that good.  Basic premise is an alien who has been stuck on Earth for hundreds of years and a K-Drama actress diva fall in love.  [Started a craze for Chicken and Beer in China.](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/02/26/korean-tv-show-sparks-chicken-and-beer-craze-in-china/)  ABC is trying to create their own version for the US.

**Heirs**: High School Romance/Drama reminiscent of The OC in some ways.  Once again starring Lee Min-Ho.  Touching, hilarious, and heart-breaking.  Basic premise is very poor girl and really rich guy fall in love, love triangle ensues.  Themes of class, self sacrifice, bullying (really big issue in Korea), and overbearing/abusive parents.  

They're all available free online at Hulu and Drama Fever, though they're loaded with commercials.  Three things to watch out for with K-Dramas is their love of flashbacks, the obsession with their OSTs, and the odd male/female relationships.  You're going to get a flashback in every single episode.  The producers seem to be required to squeeze a couple of songs into every single episode, and sometimes the song just doesn't make sense at that point in time.  You also see a very masculine centered society, with the guys frequently dragging their love interests around by their wrists.  Older women seem to be better represented, but young women get treated kinda... creepily at times.  "
Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Bitty Adventures,"Great Teacher Onizuka: either the anime, or either of the live dramas. It's what motivated me to become a teacher, and doesn't pull any punches when looking at issues adolescents face. Ten years after watcging it, I'll still rewatch it every so often to get me pumped up.

Being Human: the BBC original is 100x better than the SciFi adaptation. A look at the human condition through the eyes of a vampire, werewolf, and ghost.

Hanzaki Naoki: literally the best revenge story in existence. Breath-taking, edge of your seat plot twists. A grade acting. I have watched it multiple times. Had over 40% of the tv viewers in ALL of Japan watching it's finale.

Secret Garden: a Korean rom com. One of the few body swapping done right stories in existence. Rich, snobby playboy and tomboy stunt woman begin switching bodies, don't know why, and must pretend to be each other while they figure things out.

Sherlock: BBC drama. Best mystery show out there. Fresh take on Sherlock Holmes. The breakout role for the Hobbit's Bilbo Baggins and Smaug's actors."

Sword Art Online,Oh boy! I hope it's as good as their Deathnote adaptation.
Sword Art Online,Even though I know its unlikely I hope they take some notes from the abriged series.
Sword Art Online,"Cool! I hope they improve on the source material, though."
Sword Art Online,"Here's how I would translate this for an American audience. Just focus the whole show on the first arc set up the characters and jump back and forth from the game world to the real world. Therefore allowing to see how the real world would react to 10,000 being held hostage in a game. If they would that I think we could have a good show here. Also, give the main characters some actual characteristics instead of one note."
Sword Art Online,"Sword Art Online is going to be ""an essentially Japanese property"" right up until the [tentacle rape scene](http://www.afterbuzztv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-31-at-6.32.21-PM.png) and then they suddenly decide ""Hey, that might be a bit *too* Japanese."""
Sword Art Online,I feel like they’d have to try and make it half as bad as the Anime is. 
Sword Art Online,"Monster? Nope. Code Geass? Nope. Steins gate? Nope. Psycho Pass? Nope. Freaking Sword Art Online? Yes...

Well maybe I should be glad that actually good series aren't the ones being ruined in live action."
Sword Art Online,No i want Asuna to be played by a ukrainian or russian cosplayer with japanese dubbing
Sword Art Online,"Aww, I was looking forward to the thinkpieces and toxic fan environment."
Sword Art Online,"Does this mean it's just a Japanese studio making it and they're slapping the ""Netflix Original"" label on it because they have an exclusive license, or is it actually an American studio making it but using Asian actors? Japanese live action movies and tv shows are always really low-budget and wonky looking (well, live action anime adaptations I should say, obviously Japanese film is one of the richest cinema cultures in the world if you include Kurosawa, etc. On an unrelated note, get streaming rights for Kurosawa movies, Netflix!)"
Sword Art Online,"I can't think of a single live action adaptation that has improved on the original. Some have been terrible, some have been ok and maybe one or two could be considered ""good"" but they have all been lesser versions of the original."
Sword Art Online,Isn't SAO widely consider a shitty anime? Why would they want to do a live action verison?
Sword Art Online,Only way to make this good is to replace kirito with abridged Kirito
Sword Art Online,"Is the anime worth watching? My anime-obsessed friend hates it, but I want to give it a shot. The premise sounds interesting."
Sword Art Online,Why would they choose to make a live action version of such a terrible anime?
Sword Art Online,"If Netflix couldn't make a good adaptation out of a good animanga (Death Note), I have zero hope for their working with a dumpster fire like SAO."
Sword Art Online,"I mean this is kinda cool and all but it feels kind of like a monkeys paw situation to get this news about SAO. Of all the fucking things that are gonna be adapted to live action and stay true to the source material ,Sword "" Two years worth of semen"" art online being the one feels like a cruel joke.

Plus from what i've heard about it Ready player one is already the American version of SAO."
Sword Art Online,They gotta cast Japanese actors though.
Sword Art Online,"I have no idea why they're making a live-action version of SAO... but it can't really be much worse than the anime.

This does give me a tiny bit of hope, so I might watch just to see whether it's as bad as the source material."
Sword Art Online,"I have only watched a few episodes of this anime, but from what I hear the first season should be where you stop.  All the extra seasons ruin it, right?"
Sword Art Online,if they can expand some of the concepts in the first season that would be cool but the stuff with the fairies was all dumb 
Sword Art Online,"After death note,i'm not even sure they can adapt something as bad as sao."
Sword Art Online,Live action videogame stuff? SAO related? No and double no.
Sword Art Online,"You know...not everything needs a live action version. Looking at you death note, ghost in the shell, beauty and the beast"
Sword Art Online,"Here's how I'd handle a live-action adaptation:

1. Instead of a two year time skip, I'd have a lot of multi-episode 'filler' mini-arcs where Kirito either goes on random adventures or helps raiding parties clear bosses and progress through the various floors.

2. The Moonlit Black Cats would feature more prominently in the story and we'd see Kirito slowly befriend them more; especially Sachi who he will have a romantic relationship with. [spoiler](#s ""This would make their deaths far more dramatic since the viewers would get far more attached to the characters than they did in the anime."")

3. I'd make Kirito really socially awkward at first but become more of a sadistic antisocial asshole like the Abridged parody version of the character as the story goes on; especially after the Moonlit Black Cats arc where he becomes increasingly bitter and insular.

4. I'd introduce Suguha and Leafa in Sword Art Online. Rather than play Alfheim, she actually dives into the world of SAO in search for her cousin and willingly dives into the death game in an attempt to rescue him. Unlike her anime counterpart, Suguha doesn't have a crush on her cousin. She is introduced to Kirito but never finds out his real identity until later in the series [spoiler](#s ""which shatters both their in-game romantic relationship and their real-life familial relationship. Unlike the anime, they don't reconcile either and the whole experience has lasting implications."") 

5. I'd end the series with [spoiler](#s ""a final boss battle against Kayaba Akihiko on the 100th floor. None of this 'Heathcliff is Kayaba' bullshit. I mean Heathcliff would still be a really strong guild leader but he'd just be good at the game."")

6. I'd make dual wielding a core mechanic of the game and not just a special ability Kirito obtains because he is the chosen one.

7. I'd explore more of the romantic subplots between Sachi, Lisbeth, Silica and Leafa. I'd make them actual relationships which develop and fall apart in various ways. [spoiler](#s ""I'd also make sure that Kirito doesn't end up with Asuna."")

7. Alfheim Online never happened. [spoiler](#s ""This means no Asuna being held against her will by a guy who wants her hand in marriage who has her imprisoned in a tentacle rape dungeon."")"
Sword Art Online,"Or, here's a crazy idea: Don't make a live action version of a story that's already been told perfectly well in animation.

Well... ""perfectly well.""  It's not a great tv show.  But still, I don't think mediocre acting and shitty CG is going to improve it.  Just watch the show that already exists, you need to hear this story so much."
Sword Art Online,Or they could pull an Altered Carbon and make their in-game avatars white and real world selves Asian.
Sword Art Online,"I view that as a bad omen. Look, first of all I dont want to sound like someone who pretends to not care about representation but then gets real butthurt when there is no white lead, I think representation is a good thing. Secondly I don't mean to say that non-white protagonist is only okay if they are controlled by a different white protagonist and romantic interest. And I dont think that the movie Frozen is reprehensible propaganda, god no. BUT the information in the article does make me think that it could be sacrificing authenticity in story telling for the sake of forced representation. And this does make me worry about the future of anime adaptions. Give me a chance, this is a bit complicated.  
  
1) In a post-racial world maybe it shouldnt matter if in an international story randomly you have characters of a whatever race, but im afraid that in art things do usually have a purpose, things just are not random, or at least are not received as random by the viewers. My suggestion is, you can totally have an asian lead and a bunch of asian or whatever characters, but if the two core characters both are asian looking surrounded by a bunch of non-asian people, then this setup will almost always be or be received as some sort of a message, even if it is not meant that way. Even in 200 years in a completely global mixed communist perfect world they would watch this movie from our time and think ""okay, is there a reason these two leads are asian? considering the context of the world they are in?"". Maybe there could be a reason, but judging from the statements from one of writers it doesnt seem that way.  
  
2) The above is not my real issue. What bothers me is that authors would be willing to care less about important parts of a characterization of protagonists, maybe out of good intentions, but to the detriment of the story telling. The writer says ""it is an asian story"", but... this does not mean anything here, its a very empty claim. And I would not even care that much if this was just a whatever tvshow, but this is one of the first big anime adaptions in tv form, and especially here I think that when there constantly are these awkward political issues in the room it will be a detriment or rather, meaningful delay to this whole endeavour.  
  
I totally want audiences to call for things like representation when the industry for whatever reasons does not deliver enough, and I want authors and industry leaders who take that to heart then, and be maybe influenced in what stories they tell and how they conduct business. But I really dont want already present stories to be reshaped into something less authentic and meaningful. Otherwise people might always look back on this age of early anime adaptions as something that cant be divorced from its societal context. "
Sword Art Online,Because Asuna seems to be natural redhead isn't she only like half-Japanese though?
Sword Art Online,Sure because clearly the characters are totally Asian.
Sword Art Online,It's sad that this is considered newsworthy.

Sword Art Online,"I mean, even if it's bad, at least it won't be a bad adaptation of something good. "
Sword Art Online,fullmetal and this srls stop it do it for your souls
Sword Art Online,[removed]
Sword Art Online,"""Kirito, it says I got XP! Is that bad?"""
Sword Art Online,"It's crazy how much better the abridged series is than the real one in terms of character development and depth. Not to mention Kayaba's motivation for turning SAO into a death game...
              
Here's episode one of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0"
Sword Art Online,"They really fleshed out the characters more in that, plus the humor about mmos would be nice"
Sword Art Online,Sociopath Kirito is the best
Sword Art Online,that series was awesome when they were following release schedule with the timeline
Sword Art Online,"Honestly, it's a kind of fun premise that could be very cool if they make it less of a kinky okaku erotic fiction and more of a science fiction adventure story."
Sword Art Online,the first arc of the first season was absolutely incredible. it went downhill when they got brought out of it
Sword Art Online,"Or since the author's already rewriting the first chunk to make it less shit, just do Progressive. No stupid time skips, actually keep that weight from the first couple episodes instead of having them jump straight to OP as hell."
Sword Art Online,"Yeah maybe they will just focus more on the whole your stuck in a death game and how people deal with that and learn to survive and get strong, rather than time jump all over the place and blow up their cool idea in a half a season.  

Those months that it just timeskips over in the first say 5 episodes would be so interesting, guilds forming figuring out how to farm and explore without losing people, setting up an economy and things like that, discovering all the unknown stuff would be interesting but they speed past it to have main character be the master."
Sword Art Online,"No, no, all the characters gotta keep trying to see how well Kirito can ""duel wield""."
Sword Art Online,"> Also, give the main characters some actual characteristics instead of one note.
       
How will ~~weebs~~ the audience self-inset if every character doesn't exist solely to talk about how great the ""*character*"" Kirito is? Kirito needs his harem!
        
You also forgot: Stop having the second lead get sexually assaulted for titillation purposes. Find a new way to put them in distress. Tentacle rape isn't enough to sell merchandise and blu-rays here. Be more creative than just rapey bad guys.   "
Sword Art Online,Aww I was looking forward to my live action tentacle monster rape scene.
Sword Art Online,jesus i completely forgot about that
Sword Art Online,"Excuse me, but where the hell is that scene from?"
Sword Art Online,just add twice the tentacle rape 
Sword Art Online,what’s the point of making steins gate or psycho pass into live action shows? they’re already perfect. a remake has nowhere to go but down. SAO on the other hand has room for improvement. starting first off with getting rid of the harem crap. 
Sword Art Online,CG wouldn't translate well because of the mecha.
Sword Art Online,"Code Geass would be absolutley incredbile, especially given how racially diverse the cast inherently is and the cool geopolitics of the show, but fuck me they'd never be able to do the fight scenes. You're forgetting it's a mech show.  That would be incredibly expensive, unfeasible, actually"
Sword Art Online,"I don’t know about Code Geass.

I mean, if anyone knows about oppressing the Japanese, it would be America."
Sword Art Online,Pretty much of all series adapt they picked wrong one and the actors will be the one's blamed when shit bombs.
Sword Art Online,"Curb your fanboyism, just because a trash live action movie doesn’t take away from the series. "
Sword Art Online,Aight I agree with you
Sword Art Online,She should be played by a Japanese person…
Sword Art Online,"Don't you worry, just slapping ""Sword Art Online"" on a thing guarantees you thinkpieces and a toxic fan environment no matter what happens."
Sword Art Online,"> toxic fan environment.

Actually, I just remembered it's an anime adaptation, so we'll get that no matter what.

"
Sword Art Online,"Don't worry, it's SAO, there will still be plenty to complain about by dint of its very existence."
Sword Art Online,[deleted]
Sword Art Online,I just hope it'll be a series rather than a movie like Death Note was. I was so excited when I heard an adaption was being made then it turned out to be a movie. How does someone crunch hours of content into 1.5 - 3hrs? I won't jump ship until it's released or more is said. 
Sword Art Online,American studio. The Altered Carbon creators are behind this.
Sword Art Online,"Actually SAO has such a shit original I'm half expecting the American version to be better written.  SAO the novel was never really meant to be published, it was a web novel from a writer who went on to write better things that inexplicably got popular out of nowhere 16 years after he'd written it and then it just snowballed into one of the biggest anime franchises of all time because weebs and otakus like VR and anime girls"
Sword Art Online,Most can't compare to a story that takes a day or two to fully tell in 2 hours. 
Sword Art Online,i think inception is far better than paprika.
Sword Art Online,Because it's a shitty anime that's extremely popular.
Sword Art Online,"It makes mountains and mountains of paper dude.  It's shitty, but by god is it profitable, in both japan and America.  Even youtubers rake in the dough when they make videos about it"
Sword Art Online,"It's ironic that it's being called shitty yet it makes bills. Kinda wonder the type of people calling it shitty. I mean supposedly there have been ""better"" animes, yet make a fraction of what SAO makes. By the end of the day, if your ""good"" anime isn't making much, there goes the future of that anime. It's like most of the ppl bashing SAO do not realistically understand that anime is a product that is being sold for money. If you do not profit, IMHO it's not ""good""."
Sword Art Online,"No, it's terrible. The concept is good and has potential for indepth exploring, but it's wasted on being a power nerd fantasy with waifus and harems. Think Twilight for guys. I only manage to watch half the first season and then stopped. "
Sword Art Online,"good premise, shit execution.

just do the [abridged.](https://youtu.be/V6kJKxvbgZ0)"
Sword Art Online,I have seen far worse.  I would say it’s an ok show if you just watch the first arc.  Stop when that obviously is over and you have seen a mostly ok story with some really nice art and a cool concept.
Sword Art Online,"People on reddit hate it but I remember loving it when it came out, at least I loved the first season. Later seasons were kind of a mess."
Sword Art Online,its fun but cringe-worthy in plenty of moments 
Sword Art Online,"It's good.  It's about a guy, Kirito, who understands the game they're locked in and becomes mostly OP and while a *harem* does happen, the MC is actually dating Asuna which is atypical of your normal anime with a harem.  I enjoyed it but I don't take things too seriously."
Sword Art Online,"I actually enjoyed it very much. However, stop at episode 14, its the best poetic ending. If you go on, your curiosity might lead you down some weird episodes.

When I rewatched with my wife, i stopped at episode 14 and said nothing else came after, the end. "
Sword Art Online,"> Is the anime worth watching?

Only the first cour (13 episodes or so) is decent. The rest ranges from mediocre to terrible."
Sword Art Online,The first few episodes are good. The idea was great when it was called .hack. The abridged is amazing 
Sword Art Online,"the first 13 episodes are pretty good. the music is exceptional. after episode 13 it just becomes retarded and pointless. also, you have to be capable of looking past the cliche harem plotpoints that so many anime suffer from. it’s not too much of a harem. it’s about level 6 harem. but it’s there. "
Sword Art Online,"You can watch the abridged series inside, it executes the concept better by making the characters more true to life.  That doesn't mean you'll like them, in fact, they're intentionally grating, but so are actual MMO players

It's better written and it's funnier, which counts for something.  Voice acting is also pretty alright, I'd say it's the third most popular abridged series of all time after DBZ and Yugioh"
Sword Art Online,"From what I understand, the first season is perfectly fine.  Just don't go beyond that, lol"
Sword Art Online,"The first season is good, although it suffers from quite a few cliches. Namely the main character being a outcast nerd who is OP in another (virtual) world. I think it manages to hold up despite this, but I believe that others could point you to other anime that pulls this type of plot off in a better fashion.

Later seasons range from bland to awful as more cliches are thrown in, character progression halts, and the main character becomes too OP for any climax to stick."
Sword Art Online,"It has a good premise, if you have to watch it, watch the abridged series, it really cuts out a lot of the crap and makes a lot of improvements to it. Like making it less of a nerd fantasy with waifus."
Sword Art Online," watch the abridged series

it takes the premise and makes something with it"
Sword Art Online,Watch the first arc and stop. That's about half way through the first series and in my opinion it's fantastic until that moment where it drops the ball so hard that I can't even comprehend a suitable metaphor to describe how hard that ball dropped. 
Sword Art Online,It's a great concept. 
Sword Art Online,They made a movie as well
Sword Art Online,"although I’ll never watch it and forget it exists in a week, it’s likely to be better than netflix’s death note.

easier to improve a piece of trash than a new spin on a classic."
Sword Art Online,"look less at where the money comes from, but at who the director or writer is. "
Sword Art Online,"To be fair, Death Note 2017 was quite a bit better than the Japanese adaptions."
Sword Art Online,"Asuna has naturally blonde hair, which is a strictly European trait.  

Asians all have dark hair, 
Australian Aborigines all have dark hair,
Africans all have dark hair, 
Micronesians all have dark hair, 
Polynesians all have dark hair, 
Eskimos/Inuits all have dark hair, 
Native North Americans all have dark hair,
Native South Americans all have dark hair, 
Arabs all have dark hair, 
Persians all have dark hair,
and people from India all have dark hair.

So if you don't want to replace the character's original race with an actor of another race, you would have to cast a white actress for Asuna.  "
Sword Art Online,"If you really want to give it a go, yes. That was how I approached it back then at least with the first 14 episodes of season 1. "
Sword Art Online,"You should stop about 3 episodes in. The first half of the first arc is okay, and then it gets worse and worse. Season 2 is also terrible except for the brief arc where Kirito is almost totally absent."
Sword Art Online,"I mean, the anime itself is an adaptation.  I don't see why there's not space for another one.  I think it could be pretty interesting to see it in live action, as the setting is rather low-fantasy (in the first series) and probably very easy to adapt.  I probably wouldn't watch the different SAO 'games' though.  I don't think any of the later stories were better than the first."
Sword Art Online,"Feel free to not watch adaptations that don't appeal to you. Personally I'd like to see my favourite franchises in as many formats as possible.

That said I will never invest a single second more into the dog shit franchise that is Sword Art Online"
Sword Art Online,"The Anime is a light novel adaptation, so... why tell an animated version of a story that's already been told in print?"
Charlie and Lola,Got a kick out of the *But I’m a Cheerleader* reunion.
Charlie and Lola,I guess Charlie Barnett will appear in second season. Also it would be great to see Samira Wiley again.
Charlie and Lola,I was hoping there would be a few more OITNB girls after episode one. I’d love to see Danielle Brooks in this show
Charlie and Lola,"Every time she's on the screen, I can't help but feel she watched a ton of Columbo episodes prior... and I love it!"
Charlie and Lola,Any plans for it to come to the UK 👀
Charlie and Lola,"Such a good show, glad it's getting a 2nd season!"
Charlie and Lola,Great to see this show gaining more international interest! Cunk is great.
Charlie and Lola,She really needs to interview Marjorie Taylor Green.
Charlie and Lola,This shit isn't funny even a little sorry
Charlie and Lola,ive been watching clips of cunk and her character is absolutely golden
Charlie and Lola,we call that the netflix effect
Charlie and Lola,We forgive you?
Charlie and Lola,"It's just not your cup of tea Mate, it's funny to me though"
Charlie and Lola,"“So, what is clocks?” might be one of my favourite lines ever."
Charlie and Lola,"She opens one interview with ""Hello Science Man"" and every single time it knocks a laugh out of me like a direct hit to a pinata."
Charlie and Lola,"Some of the stuff is eclipsed by Ali G and others having done it a little better, but the viral clip of her upset nuclear weapons still exist was a brilliant twist on ""idiot."" She's stupid, but it's so manifestly horrible to contemplate that it still upsets her...touching, human shit."
Charlie and Lola,I love her getting stuck on the fact that there's a dead dog in space.
Charlie and Lola,"I really connected when he said ""I'm good""."
Charlie and Lola,"And their inspiration for Sauron was The Joker, Scarface and society."
Charlie and Lola,"With the amount of interviews done by these showrunners, Amazon and the people attached to this show, you'd think they just concluded the final episode of the final season, and went ahead to be showered with 15 Oscars and worldwide recognition ."
Charlie and Lola,"Is Amazon trying the ""piss the audience off so we get engagement"" angle here or are these guys literally this full of themselves?

Unless season 2 is a total turnaround, this is going to go into the *John Carter* dustbin of history."
Charlie and Lola,I would have no emotional connection him if I wasn't sure he's gandalf.
Charlie and Lola,"Naming off a bunch of better works of art will definitely elevate your bloated production by association, definitely."
Charlie and Lola,"I was only emotionally connected to Elrond and Durin, while the rest are bland and slow as an ent."
Charlie and Lola,That whole fake out (Slim Shady calling him sauron) at the start of the finale was so lame
Charlie and Lola,I have a very strong emotional connection to the character who did nothing and said nothing for 7.5 episodes/8.
Charlie and Lola,"Someone on Amazon's higher ups really needs to put these two on a media embargo. the interviews they are giving do not make them look good at all, nor does it inspire any sense of optimism for the next season, if there was any left after the first one concluded."
Charlie and Lola,Amazon is really pushing the hell out of marketing this after the audience reaction. Someone there is in crisis mode.
Charlie and Lola,The way they are handling the conclusion to this show and the legit criticism the show is receiving leaves me zero confidence these two bumble fucks learned anything.  These guys are legit fucking morons.
Charlie and Lola,"This show is exactly what I would think would be the result of a soulless mega corporation adapting tolkeins work.  

It has no soul, no original content, no passion.  

What did we expect???  Amazon is a current day Mordor/isengard with its very own dark lord.  

To this day I still tune in to the original trilogy music. I can see the scenes in my head when a certain tune strikes, it's beautiful, the way it all works together.  I never want to think of rings of power again, this was worse than season 8 of GOT, much worse."
Charlie and Lola,These guys really don't know what they're doing. It's really hard to have an emotional investment in a character that is purposely minimally developed for 8 hours just to keep his identity a secret.
Charlie and Lola,Sadly their inspiration for writing was fucking J.J. Abrams.
Charlie and Lola,"Well now that he suddenly speaks perfect english we might develop any connection at all.

Go figure, the biggest giveaway that these guys are hacks is that they had to resort to cheap fan service with lines from the movies to get the faintest emotional reaction."
Charlie and Lola,"It was a bunch of mediocre mystery boxes strung together with expository speeches pretending to be dialog.  

The show mostly sucks."
Charlie and Lola,Shame they wern't inspired by Tolkien.
Charlie and Lola,Might be a better show if it was inspired by Tolkien and the Trilogy lmao
Charlie and Lola,"""IAMGOOOOOD!!!"" kinda ruined that for me lol"
Charlie and Lola,The audience has no strong emotional connection to any character in the show because they are all shallow and one-dimensional with perfectly predictable storylines.
Charlie and Lola,"These two hacks need to stop doing interviews unless they're going to address the criticisms of the very poor writing in this show. They're also seemingly too stupid to even do interviews.  


The only inspiration for Gandalf in this show, should be fucking GANDALF. Why are these stupid fucks taking inspiration from the 'Iron Giant' etc. It's painfully obvious they aren't interested in being faithful to Tolkien and the Films, they just want to make their own thing. Which is not so surprisingly, horrible."
Charlie and Lola,"How do we get people to connect with this character?

Base him off of every other likable character.

Brilliant!"
Charlie and Lola,"I really don't get how anyone takes this show seriously lol, it just feels like such a letdown"
Charlie and Lola,">J.D. Payne claimed that they want the audience to have a strong emotional connection to the character.

Seeing as though he was a mute 7/8 episodes, and then generic and forgettable in the 8th, I'd say mission failed."
Charlie and Lola,"So they admit they don’t have original ideas. Everything’s based of if something else. This, the upcoming season will be Breaking Bad etc."
Charlie and Lola,"If you wanted people to have a strong emotional connection to anything in your show, you should have hired competent writers. Rings of Power is a pile of amateurish nonsense that caters to the ""shut your brain off and enjoy the pretty visuals"" demographic, and you're not getting much emotional connection out of that audience."
Charlie and Lola,"My favorite part was when he said ""You're wizard, Nori."""
Charlie and Lola,"Maybe they should have tried The Silmarillion 

But hey-ho, homicidal, Irish not hobbits it is!"
Charlie and Lola,This show would be so much cooler if they spent a billion on an all-star cast. Pick any amazing actor for any role. They would cary this show. Money better spent than.. whatever they spent it on.
Charlie and Lola,"These interviews are only doing more damage and pushing me further away from watching season two. These comments from the creators/writers/showrunner I've been reading do not inspire confidence but reveal why I think the show wasn't that good. 

You know they say ""HotD and ROP can exist at the same time. There doesn't have to be a one or the other. Everyone has time to watch both"" and it's true but they didn't consider the fact that one being soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better written and acted really, really hurts the other show. Every time I watch and finish an episode of ROP I think about how HotD is x10 better and how I'm so excited to watch HotD and dread watching ROP, with sweet relief only coming during scenes that feature the Dwarf prince and Elrond. 

It's not Halo bad or even Witcher bad but it's getting a lot wrong like Witcher has (typical TV quality writing, TV tropes and changing canon which is superior in quality) and like the Witcher showrunner and writers, the comments made after the season end are so discouraging and lessen any intention to check out the next season that I had."
Charlie and Lola,can someone just stop this madness? please. I'll be your servant for a year
Charlie and Lola,Is that why they gave him that dumbass IM GOOOD line in the last episode? Real emotional for sure.
Charlie and Lola,Was it the ET from the ET game because the guy did fall into a pit at least once.
Charlie and Lola,Good idea not to have him talk then. Really helps the audience bond with a character.
Charlie and Lola,"I've watched every episode, even some of them twice (with the wife), and mam oh man, connecting to characters is not something I'd give this show credit for.

They could be blipped from existence by Sauron and the most I'd walk away with would be ""damn the special effects looked great though"""
Charlie and Lola,"Well, ya failed."
Charlie and Lola,"It would have been nice if they were inspired by... 

*Checks notes*

Tolkien"
Charlie and Lola,"""Inspired""  by the Iron Giant? They practically stole the Superman scene. I was actually a little angry about that, I'm like sure you can pay homage to The Iron Giant but this is too much, this is just ripping it off."
Charlie and Lola,"Well, they failed."
Charlie and Lola,Would be epic if they also got inspired by .. you know... the fucking Silmarillion which they are adapting
Charlie and Lola,There are so many articles talking about how the creators were inspired by this & that and how Season 2 is Shakespearean.  It is actually sad that they cite such works then create such mediocre content
Charlie and Lola,"Okay, I think they just grabbed random titles and celebrities at random."
Charlie and Lola,They left out the inspiration they drew from dogshit
Charlie and Lola,"basically, they were inspired by everything BUT the works of JRR Tolkien."
Charlie and Lola,"They succeeded, hate is indeed an emotion."
Charlie and Lola,They might as well just start calling him Gandalf at this point. The follow your nose line was too much of a giveaway.
Charlie and Lola,">J.D. Payne claimed that they want the audience to have a strong emotional connection to the character.

Well that was a failure. Every time it went back to the Stranger or Harfoot scenes, I was getting annoyed and bored with the show even more. Not once did I ever connect with The Stranger as I do with ET or Charlie Chaplin.

Also, there was a recent article with the writers where THEY ADMIT they messed up on the pacing and realized it too late. They said they learned that smaller scenes still need some urgency, and to have tiny plot threads that relate to the grander plot - that way the machinery keeps moving along and not grinding to a halt. It's almost like they are describing the Harfoot scenes!

So anyone who also felt like this show dragged - it ain't just you, and it ain't your fault. The showrunners (who barely have experience running a large scale show) admit they mucked it up. Critics of RoP vindicated."
Charlie and Lola,Well they failed miserably
Charlie and Lola,It would be nice they were inspired by Tolkien.
Charlie and Lola,I want what these idiots were smoking.
Charlie and Lola,"Damn, really wish they woulda hired someone who was inspired by peter jackson. That or just a good writer. All tell no show"
Charlie and Lola,"Tbh I found it a little awkward watching a grown man acting like a toddler. I did like him once he started talking in full sentences, though."
Charlie and Lola,I also wanted to have an emotional connection with the characters.
Charlie and Lola,Maybe try next time to be inspired by Tolkien ffs.
Charlie and Lola,"Imagine making such a colossal dumpster-fire of a show, then trying to rationalize it and pat yourself on the back later as if you made something worthy of praise..."
Charlie and Lola,didn't feel a connection to anyone. maybe the girl hobbit  but i don't remember the name.
Charlie and Lola,Suuuuupeeeeermaaaaan
Charlie and Lola,"That's funny because not only is there zero emotional connection to this character, but there is also zero emotional connection to the Harfoots.

Removing their storylines would be immediate addition by subtraction."
Charlie and Lola,"Well, they failed in their attempt. There was no emotional connection because all we saw was an inept, bumbling fool, whose great, awe-inspiring line was:

""I'm good!""

Tolkien would have had an aneurysm watching that scene."
Charlie and Lola,This show gets far too many articles written about it and posted about it.
Charlie and Lola,Yeah I really emotionally connected with a rumbling idiot who didn't talk a proper sentence in 7 out of 8 episodes so that they could feel really clever by giving him an actual character in the last fucking episode -.-\*
Charlie and Lola,i only wish that they inspired from tolkien himself.
Charlie and Lola,Narrator: They didn't
Charlie and Lola,"It was okay, it isnt the worst thing out there, just has some really big shoes to fill.

Overall I liked the dwarfs the most, they felt the most genuine and similar to how we know gimli to act

(never read any of the books)"
Charlie and Lola,I felt nothing the whole season. Except for maybe the Elrond/Durin/Disa interactions. All the other writing was trash.
Charlie and Lola,Wish they felt the same way about the source material and lore that they seem to have for all these other random topics.
Charlie and Lola,They failed miserably.
Charlie and Lola,so he's Saruman right? that would be the first one to be sent down.
Charlie and Lola,Honestly I have enjoyed the shit out of that part of the story waaaaay more than Galadriel’s
Charlie and Lola,I kind of wanted galadriel and sauron to be a couple at the end.  Would have made a good twist.
Charlie and Lola,I enjoyed this show. I hope it get better.
Charlie and Lola,"This show absolutely does not deserve the hate it is getting online. Save your criticism for shows that actually suck, Reddit.

On the other hand all of this petty negativity makes it really easy to get people into the show. Everyone I’ve recommended it to has come back saying they were surprised by how much they enjoyed it."
Charlie and Lola,I want to like this show but it seems like Amazon is doing everything to prevent me from doing that. I can't for the life of me understand why they gave a show to people who never sold a single script or ran a show before. Their lack of talent and experience shines through every episode. The show's just not good and that sucks for all of us because nobody want's to watch crap.
Charlie and Lola,"The character I connected with the most is the wagon wheel, they went through so much."
Charlie and Lola,"> Charlie Chaplin, the Iron Giant, Buster Keaton, and E.T.

What a weird mish mash of characters lol."
Charlie and Lola,[deleted]
Charlie and Lola,"I really loved the line after: ""It's Gooding time"""
Charlie and Lola,"People continuing to remove all context from lines in a fantasy show and pretend they're cringe, huh?

Guy lost his memory and was being manipulated and told he was an evil lord by the disciples of Sauron. He was clearly in conflict about who he was and whether he was a ""peril"" or not. ""I'm good!"" makes plenty of sense in the context of him rejecting them while also attacking them to save his friend. Especially in response to their recognition that ""he is not Sauron."""
Charlie and Lola,"I fucking loved that part. 

If all the “shades of gray” nerds that hate stories where Good and Evil are palpable, diametrically opposed forces were triggered by it, then *I’m good* with that."
Charlie and Lola,exactly what tolkien was going for. /s
Charlie and Lola,And Kylo Ren
Charlie and Lola,"> And their inspiration for Sauron was The Joker, Scarface and society.

We live in a Mordor"
Animal Mechanicals,"TL;DW

Kevin Smith was approached by Berlanti productions (Arrowverse shows) to write and direct one episode of an anthology series using lesser known DC Comics characters for HBO Max called Strange Adventures. 

He expected the budget for an episode to be in line with CW shows' budgets, $2-3 million per, but was shocked when he was told they were planning $16-20 million per episode. It would have been a ten episode first season. He found out earlier this week that the project is now dead.

His episode would have had Jimmy Olsen and Perry being kidnapped by Bizarro and taken back to his world where he tries to be Superman. They were hoping for Nicholas Cage to play Bizarro."
Animal Mechanicals,The fact we missed out on Kevin making a nick cage bizarro (something nick cage would definitely do) is actually a tragedy
Animal Mechanicals,Did it feature any giant mechanical spiders?
Animal Mechanicals,Glad to see Smith is as flabbergasted as the rest of us at the post-merger direction of HBO.
Animal Mechanicals,"Ok, I didn't know about this but the budget for this is bonker, AT&T was clearly out of their mind. Can't blame Smith for being salty, but come on. AT&T clearly have problem with budgeting. Like spending 250mil for a contract with JJ Abram, who didn't produce anything but demand another 200ml for a separate TV series. Thankfully Zaslav axed it too. Madness"
Animal Mechanicals,I still want his Howard the Duck cartoon.
Animal Mechanicals,Kevin Smith strikes me as someone who has probably had far more non-starter projects than he has that have seen some sort of release.
Animal Mechanicals,"Really looking forward to this era of tv where shows get announced, hyped, and then canned at 90% production and the only thing that's on tv is ""problematic youtube/tiktok star investigates \*spins wheel of cryptids* Swamp Ape.""

But the budget for this sounds insane for an untested concept. Like that should be the budget for the next season after the first one is insanely popular."
Animal Mechanicals,I’m surprised people keep giving this man money to make things.
Animal Mechanicals,"So it was like DC Black Mirror, wow wish I didn't know this existed now I'm just disappointed it's canned."
Animal Mechanicals,"Oh wow, that sounded awesome."
Animal Mechanicals,"I really like Kevin Smith the personality. But does anybody like Kevin Smith the filmmaker anymore? His 90s wit seems so corny and cheap now.


Edit: I guess people like Kevin smith!"
Animal Mechanicals,"Sounds pretty mediocre not gonna lie, I grew up watching Kevin Smith films in school like mallrats, chasing amy and dogma, but he makes some pretty average movies as of late like the Jay and silent Bob reboot that literally just lives off nostalgia, hopefully clerks 3 is good and this doesn’t sound like a giant loss tbh"
Animal Mechanicals,Good he has wrecked enough things.
Animal Mechanicals,The Zas strikes again! Another big budget show canned to make way for more reality shows…
Animal Mechanicals,Kevin smith is a joke.
Animal Mechanicals,After what he did to masters of the universe revalations I'm surprised he'll get approached to do anything ever again.
Animal Mechanicals,They would have been bad.very very bad like everything he has made over the last 20 years.  He had so much promise and he’s a fan of all the right things but fuck his movies suck.
Animal Mechanicals,Fuuuuuck Kevin Smith for what he did to the he-man series. I was one of his biggest fans. I stayed a fan and watched his movies even though they have gotten worse and worse over the years. But he fucked us over for the last time.
Animal Mechanicals,His Heman was hot garbage.
Animal Mechanicals,Tusk was the last thing I watch from Kevin Smith.
Animal Mechanicals,[deleted]
Animal Mechanicals,"Awwwwww boo hoo. Guess killing any faith fans had in his projects other than his Skewniverse movies was a bad business decision in the long run.  
Oh well, so anyway…."
Animal Mechanicals,This is excellent news.
Animal Mechanicals,Good. He probably would have ruined it like he ruined he-man.
Animal Mechanicals,Let’s just set fire to WB’s pocket book. What a ridiculous budget
Animal Mechanicals,I lost all respect for Kevin Smith after he utterly destroyed He-Man and lied about it.
Animal Mechanicals,">but was shocked when he was told they were planning $16-20 million per episode. It would have been a ten episode first season.

This would have been one of the most expensive TV shows ever, wtf?"
Animal Mechanicals,obviously too expensive but the concept has potential. Shocked they couldnt find a way to bring the budget down.
Animal Mechanicals,"> They were hoping for Nicholas Cage to play Bizarro.      
     
Would have loved to see that..."
Animal Mechanicals,Missing the latter half where Smith is perplexed and saddened by the post-merger direction of HBO.
Animal Mechanicals,"(Berlanti also an EP on DC non-arrowverse shows like Titans, Doom Patrol, etc)"
Animal Mechanicals,I remember reading an article about how Nicolas Cage wanted to star as superman in the past and they even had a picture of him in costume. This would have probably been something he'd do just purely based on the fact that it would kinda fulfill what didn't come to be for him previously. Poor guy was probably aware of this and now it fell though. How shitty it must be to know you had both a superman and bizarro movie fail that you would have starred in!
Animal Mechanicals,"No, but  It did mention toyman"
Animal Mechanicals,At $16-20 million an episode I can see why this got the ax. Lol. Who green lit this?
Animal Mechanicals,"The more we keep hearing, the more I'm flabbergasted at ATTs decision making more so then the post-merger direction"
Animal Mechanicals,"Anyone hiring Smith is clearly out of their mind, money has nothing to do with it

And Smith is always salty, have you seen his shit-fits when people didn't like his cartoon?"
Animal Mechanicals,I think he’s just more vocal about it. Most people don’t talk about projects in development because they could easily be shutdown.
Animal Mechanicals,"Everyone in hollywood has far more non-starter, unproduced and rejected projects than released. That's the nature of the game."
Animal Mechanicals,They are finally stopping
Animal Mechanicals,"It was an anthology, but it wasn't about phones."
Animal Mechanicals,"For me, it’s been all downhill since Dogma."
Animal Mechanicals,"I liked the few flash/arrow episodes I saw he directed (so he wasn't the one writting it and wasn't the one setting up things ... he was just responsible for the directing and probably some of the editing). I also enjoyed his he man show despite not giving a shit about he-man.

I just think his movies aren't for me anymore but I like that he has fun with his friends making it and enjoy his podcasts."
Animal Mechanicals,"I for one welcome ‘My 90 Day Secret Identity’, ‘My 600lb Bizarro Life’ and Honey Boo Boo joining the Batfamily."
Animal Mechanicals,"Yea I lost all hope for this guy after masters of universe, he just seems like a corporate shill who pretends to be one of us nerds"
Animal Mechanicals,"The second season was much better, it even had He-Man!"
Animal Mechanicals,His Heman is awesome and has over 90% on reotten tomatoes. People who attack that show clearly never watched the originals.
Animal Mechanicals,Masters of the Fucking Universe! He-man isn't even in the title!
Animal Mechanicals,Doom Patrol makes me feel like Gerard Way went to his weed dealer's run-down hoarder house and took notes on everyone hanging out there so he could make fun of them later.
Animal Mechanicals,Redstate and Tusk were great. So I'm not sure what you mean by non ViewAskewniverse movies being bad.
Animal Mechanicals,I'll never understand regular people rooting for business moves over more art.
Animal Mechanicals,"I get it from a business perspective but I cant help but think big budget explorations of smaller characters could be great. It really looks like anything with any risk is just dead at this point. Obviously bring the budget down from 20 per episode, youd need to use more recurring locations across a season and use lots and stages, but this could have been good."
Animal Mechanicals,"“Ruined” He-Man? You can’t polish a turd, Beavis."
Animal Mechanicals,It’s a standard budget range for big budget streaming episodes these days.
Animal Mechanicals,Apparently Stranger Things S4 cost 30 million per episode and Rings of Power cost over 50 million per episode.
Animal Mechanicals,*Cough*ANIMATION*Cough*
Animal Mechanicals,"That movie was Superman Lives which was also written by Kevin Smith, meant to be directed by Tim Burton. I’d highly recommend watching the Evening with Kevin Smith clip where he talks about it. 

So I assume he wanted Cage because it would be a nice bookend to that story and project that never happened."
Animal Mechanicals,He also named his son after Kal El
Animal Mechanicals,At least he still got to voice Superman in Teen Titans Go! to the Movies. That movie was awesome. Probably has the best >!Stan Lee cameo!< ever.
Animal Mechanicals,You can see part of this movie by watching Wild Wild West.
Animal Mechanicals,"Exactly. Everyone is acting like HBO Max is destroying its brand, but these are sensible decisions. Handing $16 million to Kevin Smith, a director whose projects still look cheap and amateurish thirty years into his career, to make a single episode of TV is a total waste of money."
Animal Mechanicals,if its a 40-60min live action episode with better than CW quality than its not too far fetched
Animal Mechanicals,It’s not as if most of the DC Superhero projects that THAT profitable. I don’t think marvel tv shows cost 20mil an episode either.
Animal Mechanicals,Season 2 is on its way so sounds like it was just a vocal minority. Funny that.
Animal Mechanicals,"Aww, poor thing. Did he ruin your childhood?"
Animal Mechanicals,yeah dude obviously
Animal Mechanicals,By critics? Yes. By audience? Not even close. Lol
Animal Mechanicals,Yes and Constantine isn’t in the title but Hellblazer IS Constantine.
Animal Mechanicals,Did Season 3 fall apart? I enjoyed the first 2 seasons but i know the ending of the second season into season 3 took a big hit due to covid.
Animal Mechanicals,"Tusk is a lot of things. Great probably isn’t something I’d necessarily use to describe it. Red State was probably the last solid film he made, though a part of me hopes that Clerks 3 is as enjoyable as Clerks 2 was."
Animal Mechanicals,Just rather have the money be invested in something I would actually watch.
Animal Mechanicals,"It was doomed to be cancelled with such a ridiculous budget. Also, if the rest of the writers were of a similar calibre as Kevin Smith then I doubt it would be worth the watch."
Animal Mechanicals,Clearly you didn't grow up watching the show. Might as well say every 80's cartoon was shit while you're at it.
Animal Mechanicals,">  Rings of Power cost over 50 million per episode.

I have to assume some of that is writing the licensing cost onto production."
Animal Mechanicals,I predict that we're going to have a ten pack of $50mil turds soon!
Animal Mechanicals,Those are established IPs though. $16-20 million wouldn't seem unreasonable for something like House of Dragons.
Animal Mechanicals,"> Stranger Things S4 cost 30 million per episode

Most of those episodes were 90 minutes long."
Animal Mechanicals,"in the video, he say he is in contact with DC to try to get his episode into a comic book"
Animal Mechanicals,"You can also read the screenplay. 

http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/superman-lives-script.html"
Animal Mechanicals,also the documentary about it where the crazy producer is interviewed and confirm all of it.
Animal Mechanicals,Giant mechanical spiders everywhere!
Animal Mechanicals,They cost an estimated $15 million an episode.
Animal Mechanicals,Meaning it wasn't going to be anything like black mirror
Animal Mechanicals,A vocal minority were upset it wasn't all about HeMan himself. Sorry your nostalgia boner wasn't stroked.
Animal Mechanicals,"Not the same thing. The original series was called He-man and the Masters of the Universe. This series was called Masters of the Universe. That would include all of them including him, but not necessarily having him be the lead.  There is going to be a Part 3 where he may move back into the main character spot, but the previous 2 parts were to build a bigger, more interesting world. I was a huge fan of the 80's show and absolutely loved what Kevin and the writers did with the new series. All the whiners, butt-hurt over a cartoon from 30+ years ago, made to sell toys, make me laugh. How pathetic their lives must be that this is something that they need to focus on and waste so much energy being upset about. If you don't like it move on. It's not even the only Masters of the Universe show they released this year. Maybe you'll like the other one better."
Animal Mechanicals,"Honestly I couldn't tell!  The first two seasons were 75% the gang moping about in the house and whining and maybe 25% of them actually leaving and doing stuff, and I only fell out of season 3 with maybe 2-3 episodes left because I just couldn't take the pouting and self-pity anymore.  If they had just made a series about Danny the street/hippie van helping disenfranchised people, it would have been twice as better."
Animal Mechanicals,I really enjoyed Tusk and how fucked up it was.
Animal Mechanicals,They're not going to spend this money on something else though.
Animal Mechanicals,"His comics writing is usually pretty good, he understands the characters well. His movie writing isn't as good though."
Animal Mechanicals,"I did grow up in the 80’s, and the cartoons were shit. Next you’re going to tell me how awesome Inspector Gadget was."
Animal Mechanicals,Amazon has a $1 billion budget for 5 seasons of this show already
Animal Mechanicals,"Nope! They paid $250 million for the rights alone and $462 million for the first season. Insane, but hopefully it's amazing!"
Animal Mechanicals,I remember reading that a while back and almost immediately figuring out why they didn’t want to make it.
Animal Mechanicals,Actually I am wrong (I could have just googled it…) and they’re like 25 mil per episode.
Animal Mechanicals,an high budget anthology series on a streaming network with scifi stories with a twist. wanted me to write twilight zone instead. Learn to not be so literal dude
Animal Mechanicals,"Nah, everything has to cater to their specific tastes or they're throw hissy fits like the little kids they still are."
Animal Mechanicals,"Umm. I’d really like to reply with a detailed breakdown of your response, but it’s so wrong, I really can’t. It sucked. And, if you’d like to know how I know that? THERE IS NO PLAN FOR A FOLLOW UP. If it was the awesome tale you say it was, the. There would be sequels and spin-offs and the toys would be leaping off the shelves. LOL reality really must hurt the woke idiots."
Animal Mechanicals,They’ll invest it in expanding the 90 Day Fiancé Universe.
Animal Mechanicals,"No, Inspector gadget sucked. I'll give you that."
Animal Mechanicals,But at 50 million an episode that would only be like 20 episodes
Max and Ruby,"We have run out of time but want to thank everybody who has watched and enjoyed the show from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for your questions, sorry we couldn't answer them all and we sincerely hope we'll see you back at Portland Row before too long. 

Joe, Ruby, Cameron and Ali. x"
Max and Ruby,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
Max and Ruby,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
Max and Ruby,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
Max and Ruby,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It’s been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
Max and Ruby,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you’ve done trapeze! (I’m an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons 👀)"
Max and Ruby,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
Max and Ruby,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
Max and Ruby,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
Max and Ruby,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
Max and Ruby,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
Max and Ruby,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood’s usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
Max and Ruby,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn’t be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
Max and Ruby,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
Max and Ruby,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
Max and Ruby,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
Max and Ruby,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
Max and Ruby,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing 😂

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about 😂) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
Max and Ruby,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
Max and Ruby,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
Max and Ruby,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
Max and Ruby,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
Max and Ruby,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
Max and Ruby,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?
Max and Ruby,"Not show related, but for Ali: being that you're a lit student, do you have a favorite book and/or author?!?!"
Max and Ruby,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
Max and Ruby,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? 😂👀"
Max and Ruby,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
Max and Ruby,[deleted]
Max and Ruby,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
Max and Ruby,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
Max and Ruby,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
Max and Ruby,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
Max and Ruby,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
Max and Ruby,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
Max and Ruby,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
Max and Ruby,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
Max and Ruby,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
Max and Ruby,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a “show for kids”.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
Max and Ruby,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ❤️"
Max and Ruby,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
Max and Ruby,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
Max and Ruby,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‘locklyle’ shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
Max and Ruby,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
Max and Ruby,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It’d make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character’s past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren’t having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they’d be doing?"
Max and Ruby,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
Max and Ruby,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
Max and Ruby,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
Max and Ruby,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it’s one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here’s my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it’s based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
Max and Ruby,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
Max and Ruby,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
Max and Ruby,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
Max and Ruby,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
Max and Ruby,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
Max and Ruby,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
Max and Ruby,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
Max and Ruby,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
Max and Ruby,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
Max and Ruby,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
Max and Ruby,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
Max and Ruby,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
Max and Ruby,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
Max and Ruby,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
Max and Ruby,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
Max and Ruby,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
Max and Ruby,what were first and last shootings?
Max and Ruby,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
Max and Ruby,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
Max and Ruby,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
Max and Ruby,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
Max and Ruby,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Max and Ruby,what was your favourite location to film?
Max and Ruby,"The netflix adaption of Lockwood & Co was so visually stunning and still did the book series justice! 

What scene was most fun to film? Because of the scene itself, or on-set antics?"
Max and Ruby,"For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: what talent would you prefer to have? Touch, Sight or Listening?"
Max and Ruby,"Thank you to everyone involved in this project! It is a pitch perfect adaptation of one of my favorite series of books. Love the cast, the settings, and the whole vibe of the show! Hoping for more seasons as I would love to see Aickmere’s Department Store and the Fittes’ headquarters scenes on screen. 

Question for the cast: what was the most challenging scene to film?"
Max and Ruby,choose my lockwood and co themed tattoo PLEASE
Max and Ruby,"For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What is your favorite song from the soundtrack? 

I love the show so much! I had never read the books, but after one watch, I was inspired to read the books! That's how great the show was! Perfect adaptation! After reading the books, i can appreciate the work that everyone put into the show that much more to bring Jonathon Stroud's masterpiece to life. Best show I've seen in years! And the acting was on point! I'm super impressed with Lockwood's character! He was literally copied and pasted from the books to TV lol. Lucy is a badass and George is hilarious and so lovable. Y'all are awesome! :)"
Max and Ruby,"To all four of you - 

The show's had a chokehold on me ever since I watched it (as soon as it came out) and I haven't been able to eat/sleep/watch anything else because it's always on my mind! I'm not even exaggerating 

So first of all, thank you so so so so so much for this opportunity, my brain is finally at peace.

As for the question, how does it feel to be a part of something as big as this? You guys have put in your absolute 100% and trust me it shows! Not only have you catalysed the spreading of this fandom, but every single person who has watched the show has only had positive stuff to say about it!"
Max and Ruby,Why does Lockwood wear pink socks? And are they the same ones or does he have multiple pairs lol?
Max and Ruby,Is Lockwood jealous of Lucy initially that she can speak to type threes?
Max and Ruby,"What was it like filming the scene when Lucy is ""possessed"" by Annabelle?"
Max and Ruby,"Greetings from Ukraine! Thanks for the opportunity to ask you a question! After watching the adaptation, I really wanted to read the books, so I have a lot of respect for the painstaking work on the series.  
Before I ask the question, I just want to express my endless love to the actors who played their roles incredibly. This is the best adaptation from netflix in the last year, if not two :ʼD  
Questions for Ruby: did you prepare in any way for the role, I mean maybe read books to soak up the atmosphere, or maybe listen to some playlists like Ali. Maybe you were looking for something on tiktok or aesthetics on pinterest? and did you enjoy the fencing lessons before filming?  
Questions for Ali: (George is my favorite character and the way you played him is just amazing). Do you like George as a character? Do you have any similarities? maybe you found some minuses or pluses in your character?  
Questions for Cameron: When I found out that this was your debut role, it was a pleasant surprise for me, because you completely got into the character of Lockwood and his charisma. Did you read the books or maybe some excerpts? Plus you are very good at using a rapier. If you had the chance, would fencing become your hobby? Is it possible that fencing is already one of the hobbies?  
And a question for all three of you: if you had the opportunity to take a vacation as characters from the show, where would you go/fly and what would you do there?"
Max and Ruby,"THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCE! The show is incredible! I love it! Everyday I’m watching it twice! 
Q to Joe: Did you saved all sets, costumes and stuff for maybe a second season or has everything been dismantled?"
Max and Ruby,"For Joe: Any deleted scenes that had to be cut due to time that could be shared?

And also, could you by chance go into detail on how the red room scene was done with the blood dripping from the walls? What had to be done to get that specific effect? 

For Cameron: What's a specific character dynamic between Lockwood and any other character that you wish we got to see more of? 

For Ruby: What was your favorite part about playing Lucy? She's such a developed character with a pretty big depth of emotions as we saw. Was it difficult to get that range of emotions without it seeming forced at all?"
Max and Ruby,"Thank you for doing this! I have a lot of questions but I'll try to keep it to a minimum

For Joe:  Why did you decide to have Norrie get ghostlocked instead of ghosttouched?

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: What do you think your character's favorite movie is?

For Ruby: What was the transition like going from something like ""Bridgerton"" to a show like ""Lockwood & Co?""

For Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: In what way do you think you are similar from and different from your characters?

For Joe: Who was your favorite character outside of the main trio to write and why?

For all of you: Do you like to watch fan edits or read fanfiction? If so, what's been your favorite edit or fanfic?

For Ali: What do you think George's favorite dish to cook is?

For Joe: What made you want to adapt these books specifically into a TV show?"
Max and Ruby,"For anyone: Which scene was the most difficult and/or took the longest to film? 

Bonus random question: what’s your favorite ghost movie?"
Max and Ruby,"Question for everyone: what’s something that you could see the characters doing together that we don’t see in the books or on screen? Ex: dance parties to relieve stress, everyone piling into the library for a book club, etc"
Max and Ruby,"To Ruby and Cameron,

Q: How would you guys describe Lucy and Lockwood's relationship?"
Max and Ruby,"How do I audition for your show? They say to be bold and ask, so I'm trying!"
Max and Ruby,For Cameron and Ali: Can you guys confirm your birthdays? The internet is going crazy trying to find them out haha
Max and Ruby,"Hey Joe and the others!!!!
Season 1 was amazing. Can't wait for more.
So do you guys have an idea about how many seasons you want to do to wrap up the story? 
Also, episode 7 was amazing!!! Bit shoutout to the cast and crew. Loved the show."
Max and Ruby,Favorite book in the series?
Max and Ruby,"Thank you guys for making the PERFECT adaptation of my favourite books. I can’t believe how lucky we are to have received such an incredible adaptation 🥰❤️

I’d like to ask Cameron, Ruby and Ali- what is your favourite book in the series?
And is there a particular moment across the five books that stood out to you? 

Thank you guys for doing such an incredible job!! You honestly feel like the characters jumped from the books! 🥹❤️"
Max and Ruby,What did you all do to get yourself into your character?
Max and Ruby,"Loved the show so much! It felt so natural and you can definitely tell a lot of hard work and talent went into this from all aspects, wonderful actors, wonderful script, editing, everything!

Aside from the obvious haunting question of when can we expect season 2… my question for the cast is if they had to pick an ability from the show which would it be? 
For Joe, can you share what some favorite moments from the books you are/were most excited to translate/adapt into the show?"
Max and Ruby,"(To Cameron, Ruby, and Ali) 
If you could have taken anything from the set as a keepsake, what would it have been? And why?"
Max and Ruby,For Cameron and Ruby: Ali's mentioned in interviews that he made and listened to specific playlists to help get into character - were there songs (or other media) that helped you prepare for Lockwood and Lucy as well?
Max and Ruby,For everyone: what is your favorite haunting in the book series?
Max and Ruby,"Thank you so much for giving us such an awesome show! The books and the show both depict a variety of different ghost types, from Changers to Cold Maidens to Spectres. What's everyone's favourites?"
Max and Ruby,Any fun stories from downtimes on set? How was filming on all the amazing sets + at the different locations? <33
Mia and Me,You played Charlie Cox’s dad in Stardust. Can we extrapolate this data to assume that Billy Russo is the father of Daredevil?
Mia and Me,Not about Shadow and Bone but I loved you in The Punisher as Russo. If you were given the chance would you return to the MCU? Thanks!
Mia and Me,Can you please stop dying? I'm traumatized every single time
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben!

First, you're amazing in concert, I saw your first show in LA and loved it!

Second, I wanted to ask - we've seen Freddy fully embrace the Kazzle Dazzle name. I've seen The Darkling referred to as ""Darkle Sparkle."" I was hoping that you'd see this and the next time you and Freddy post things together, maybe you can refer to yourselves as Kazzle Dazzle and Darkle Sparkle just once?"
Mia and Me,"Mr. Barnes, can you tell us a happy memory about Narnia?"
Mia and Me,"Greetings Benjamin, I just want to know the name of The Darkling’s horse—if there’s no official name, I want to know what YOU think it would be. Thx"
Mia and Me,"Does Leigh Bardugo work closely with the show and if so, how is it working with her? She seems really involved when I check out her Instagram and seems like she has a great relationship with the cast."
Mia and Me,"I've been in love with you since I watched you in Prince Caspian and Stardust when I was 12 years old. So ummmm will you marry me?

Just kidding. My question is, are you a Neil Gaiman fan? What other books do you enjoy?"
Mia and Me,What is your favourite type of cheese ? 🧀
Mia and Me,What comes natural to you.... Playing A Bad Guy or Playing a good guy? And Why?
Mia and Me,"Do you, as a person, think the Darkling is redeemable?"
Mia and Me,"I have two for you Ben
1. How would you describe The Darkling’s feelings regarding the women he’s impacted in the series ie Alina, Zoya, Genya, Baghra
2. Have you, at any point in your life, read fanfiction about a certain long haired, convicted murderer that turns into a dog at will and his friend group whilst they were at school?"
Mia and Me,Could you spoil one of the lines that you managed to sneak in this season? 🤧🤧🤧
Mia and Me,DROP THE SKINCARE ROUTINE!!
Mia and Me,How did you and Jessie Mei Li develop such great chemistry?? You guys sizzle on screen and seem like lovely friends off screen!
Mia and Me,what music/album do you think fits the Darkling and his story?
Mia and Me,"Hi, now I feel guilty for not watching S&B yet."
Mia and Me,Hi. Thank you for doing this! Hope you’re having a great week. The Polygon interview just got released so I’m wondering if you can share what your ideal rom com role is?
Mia and Me,Which order of Grisha do you most align with?
Mia and Me,"What was your experience like working with Zoe Wanamaker? Did you share a mother-son sort of relationship off cameras (if so, how many times did she hit your leg with her stick) or was the relationship like coworkers."
Mia and Me,"Hey hi! if the darkling had a signature scent, what would it be?"
Mia and Me,hello! how different was to play darklina scenes this season rather then the previous one?
Mia and Me,What is your favourite book in SaB series?
Mia and Me,which character you wish the darkling had more scenes with?
Mia and Me,From the six crows which one would you most likely be friends with?
Mia and Me,What's the scene you're the proudest of?
Mia and Me,What would be The Darkling’s favorite stuffed animal???
Mia and Me,"If you could swap characters with your co-cast, who would you want to swap with?"
Mia and Me,which episode of season 2 would you say is your favorite?
Mia and Me,Are you working on any new music soon?
Mia and Me,"I first know about you as Prince Caspian and since then I’ve watched you as Logan in Westworld, Jigsaw in Punisher and Darkling in S&B. 

My question is, which type of characters do you prefer playing? The dark ones or the nice ones?"
Mia and Me,"If you could have any quote or icon from The Grishaverse tattooed on you, what would it be and why?"
Mia and Me,"You play fantastic heels in Shadow and Bone and Westworld. Will we see good guy Ben Barnes anytime soon? 

Also your long hair look is #goals for me. Any tips?"
Mia and Me,Have u ever read the picture of Dorian Gray
Mia and Me,#RUSSO!!!
Mia and Me,What was it like being an audiobook narrator for The Lives of Saints and The Demon in the Wood for Leigh Bardugo? Was it a new experience? What was your favorite part?
Mia and Me,"Hey! Great to have you here! I have following questions:

The darkling looks much older in the show than in the books (even though he is hundreds of years old in the books too). Dont get me wrong, you are a great cast for him! In the books he is as old as Alina, how do you think changes that ""up-ageing"" their relationship? 

And: are the costumes comfortable? Sometimes the keftas look kinda stiff and I am wondering about the scar make up too!

Cant wait seeing you all on screen soon again!"
Mia and Me,"bin bons???? 

but in all seriousness, your performance as the darkling is truly insane- you bring so much nuance to this character while still making it clear that his actions are just.. awful. i remember growing up watching you play prince caspain too, so i guess my question is, who are your favourite literary heroes and villains? (p.s. i LOVE that you're an anna karenina fan too!)"
Mia and Me,"Since your have parents come from a fantastic professional mental health background, I wonder how they reacted to your roles of being an absolute psychopath. Did your parents ever recommended you to therapy looking at your immense sense of intrigue towards recently portraying a villain."
Mia and Me,Not a question but you're great in Cabinet of Curiosities on Netflix.
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben!! Thank you for taking the time to answer fan questions on here. 

We know that you and Jessie watched Jane Eyre to prepare for the first season :) Did you do anything in particular with Jessie to prepare for Darklina scenes in the second season?"
Mia and Me,"Hi 🥰
Can you tell us a bit about your experience with narrating audiobooks? Do you have any vocal warm ups you follow and how do you prepare for a day of recording? 

do you ever mess up or are you just (annoyingly) perfect

MUCH LOVE"
Mia and Me,What was your favorite scene to film as Billy Russo in The Punisher?
Mia and Me,did any of your s&b castmates fangirl over you the first you met them? haha
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben!!! 

What would you say a typical filming day looks like for you? Any *rituals* or specifics you do before starting a scene or starting your day overall? 

❤️❤️❤️"
Mia and Me,"What is the one project you've done that you'd suggest to someone who's never watched your work, that you think summarizes best what you are/represent as an actor? ❤️"
Mia and Me,"If the show is renewed for season 3, do you think that you would feel comfortable returning as the Darkling (if/when he's killed off, if/when they go the resurrection route) considering that they massacred the S1 development and backstory of the character in favour of making Aleksander the scapegoat for the systemic oppression of the Grisha in S2?

You added a lot of humanity to the character and elevated him from a one-dimensional villain to a fallible human just desperate to save his people from persecution. From the S2 trailer, it seems that they just want to erase all of that work. Whether you step down or not, thank you for all you've done to give the Darkling depth and growth.

PS If they cast for a young Darkling to do any Demon in the Wood flashbacks, might you recommend Louis Partridge? He's perfect for younger you, even if you are ageless and immortal.  


Much love,

a fellow English degree nerd"
Mia and Me,How do you feel about the way the show handles the Darkling & Alina’s relationship/dynamic in the second season? Super excited to see it!
Mia and Me,"What was your favorite part about shooting for Season 2? Were there moments from the books that you were craving to do or new characters you were excited to meet? 

Also: you’ve played characters that come from books before; what makes Shadow and Bone stand out as another literary adaptation for you?"
Mia and Me,"In season 1 there were hints of the Grisha being an oppressed minority and you spoke about it in some interviews, but I have not seen this mentioned so far in any season 2 interview…did season 2 ignore how the Grisha were persecuted for hundreds of years before the Darkling lived???"
Mia and Me,"As a long-time Shadow and Bone fan its exciting to see the characters come to life on screen, especially the Darkling!

Is there any aspect of the book version of the Darkling that you've primarily kept in mind while acting as him? Thanks!"
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben, I'm rewatching Season 1 just now and I have to say it's still one of the greatest show on Netflix and your performance is brilliant.

Q: How does it feel to be the villain in Shadow and Bone?

I can't wait to watch Season 2."
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben! Hope you’re doing well! My question is, what is your favourite thing about playing the Darkling? Is there a particular aspect of his character you find the most interesting or fun to explore? Thanks! 🖤"
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben, you don't know how excited I am to have you back as The Darkling believe me this wait has seemed like an eternity haha. I know that you will have many questions to answer and I hope you can answer some of the ones that I am going to leave you:  
  
***1.- What was your biggest challenge that you faced in the recording of this second season?***  
***2.- What is your favorite dialogue of this second season?***  
***3.- This is not a question, I just wanted to tell you that if you keep giving shows I really hope you can come to Mexico to give even one show.***  
  
And I don't want to miss the opportunity to tell you how much ***I love you***, in fact you have been with me practically all my life since I met you in Narnia and I hope to have the opportunity to meet you in person very soon, I love you, I love you, I love you and ***I am very proud of you. XOXOXO***"
Mia and Me,"Which role is the most challenging for you so far, and why?"
Mia and Me,Whos your favorite shadow and bone cast member to work with?
Mia and Me,"If you were born in Ketterdam alongside the other crows, what job do you think you would do in the gang?"
Mia and Me,"Can you tell us your personal favorite episode of season 2? And any hope for Darklina fans??

On a side note, pretty ptlretty please do a fan convention in the US. (with a cherry on top)"
Mia and Me,How do you prepare for more intimate scenes like the kissing scene with Jessie?
Mia and Me,will we get more Alina and Darkling content?
Mia and Me,Would the darkling listen to Taylor Swif?
Mia and Me,"Hello from Italy 🤗
What are you favourite memories from shooting Shadow and Bone season 2?
I really love all your performances and I'm so looking forward to see the new season just because you're in it. Lots of love xx"
Mia and Me,"Hello Ben! I have been a longtime fan of the series, and I love the nuance you bring to the Darkling! Book Darkling could feel like a cartoon villain sometimes, but you play him with so much care that the viewer sympathizes enough to hate themselves for rooting for him. 

Do you think the Darkling really cares for Alina as a person? If so, does he care about her because of her powers, or because she is the only one as endless as he is? Or is she just a pawn to him? 

Much thanks for reading, can't wait for season 2!"
Mia and Me,"After shadow and bone, would you like to work with Jessie again? She's so talented, and you two work perfectly together."
Mia and Me,"Hi, you are amazing villain in Shadow and Bone. 
The Darkling is my most favorite character on the show.I'm so excited to watch season2.

You've played roles of villains/bad guys many times.
Your acting is just amazing. And you seem like a very nice person. How do you separate your work and your private life? Has playing villains affected your private life?

I also wanna know funny behind the scenes stories about Shadow and Bone.


Lastly, watching Shadow and Bone helped me get through when I was in my lowest point of life. Thank you for your amazing work and your costar's amazing work. The show is so special for me."
Mia and Me,"I had no idea who you were before I watched Shadow & Bone but I became a big fan of the show almost entirely because of your scenes. Also I'm jealous I'll never be able to pull off an all black outfit like you can.

Anyways, you've been an actor for a majority of your life.  What is a role you wished you would be asked about more and why?"
Mia and Me,How is playing the Darkling different or similar to your previous roles?
Mia and Me,"Hello Ben ! I’m excited to see you back in season 2 ! And by the way, you have such a lovely singing voice ! My question is : What would be your dream project/role ?"
Mia and Me,"Which episode from Season 2 is your favourite, and why? Also hi, love you <3"
Mia and Me,"Hello Ben!! Not including the Darkling, who is your favourite Grishaverse character?"
Mia and Me,what can you tell us about the darkest part of shadow and bone season 2?
Mia and Me,Tell us one darkling's line you included in season 2
Mia and Me,fav darklina moment from the books?
Mia and Me,"What have you taken from your time as the Darkling? Either physical set objects, lessons, etc"
Mia and Me,"besides your character, who's the most interesting character for this season ?"
Mia and Me,what's your favorite thing about Aleksander?
Mia and Me,Hi Ben! Please tell us whether we get any Darklina goodness in S2? 🖤
Mia and Me,"If you could make up another Grisha power, what would it be?"
Mia and Me,"hi ben, i'm rewatching s&b s1 rn and i love your performance more somehow. i remember the fandom basically going crazy when you were cast, was that an overwhelming response? did it make the role less or more daunting and you less or more nervous?"
Mia and Me,What was the most fun scene to film from season one?
Mia and Me,"Hi Ben! 

My question for you is: if you could put any of the other movie or tv characters you played in the past in the Grishaverse (to be a hero or a villain, your choice) who would you choose and why?"
Mia and Me,who do you think would be the darkling favorite author and why? 🫵🏻
Mia and Me,Hi Ben! I love seeing your appreciation for the grishaverse books and Leigh - do you have a favourite scene from the S&B trilogy and a favourite scene from the SoC duology? Cant wait for s2!
Mia and Me,"Even though you play the darkling (and amazingly at that), which shadow and bone character do you think is most similar to you?"
Mia and Me,"Hey Ben! Hope you're doing well.
I wanted to ask if you have any book recommendations, I trust your taste. Thank you! Can't wait to see Shadow and Bone on Thursday."
Mia and Me,What’s your favorite book in the Grishaverse?
Mia and Me,"hi! absolutely ecstatic for the release of season 2 and i was wondering if the grishaverse was real, what place would you choose to travel to?
i’d personally love to explore the jurda farms in novyi zem!"
Mia and Me,What's your favorite line from the upcoming season? 🥺
Mia and Me,How did you prepare for the audition as the Darkling??
Mia and Me,who is your favourite crow?
Mia and Me,"Hey Ben! 
just wondering .. if you could play any of the six crows, which one would you pick and why?
sending love <3"
Mia and Me,why is darkling such an emo crying baby
Mia and Me,What do you think about Jessie? 🙂
Mia and Me,"Hey Ben! You always seem like such a fun, loving nice guy in social media and interviews but seem to have a preference for playing bad guys (and wonderfully, I must say, I've loved your roles in Westworld and Shadow & Bone, but have been a fan since Narnia). Can you share with us why? I'm guessing it's because it's fun to pretend to be someone else, but I wondered if there are other reasons.

Also, revealing the Darkling's real name was a significant thing in the Siege & Storm book and a very memorable line from Alina in Ruin & Rising, but in the show it's mentioned very early in the story. Why the change?"
Mia and Me,"hello ben!!! i’ve been a fan since your narnia days, but your role as aleksander in s&b and the show in general has meant a lot to me—i was juggling an intense degree program and taking care of a family member pretty much alone when s1 came out, and it was an escape that brought me lots of joy and led me to some amazing friends. thank you for the passion and commitment you bring to your craft and all the roles you play! 

actual question time: who’s your favorite poet? are there any particular poems or lines of poetry that are (figuratively) forever engraved in your brain?"
Mia and Me,"Hello!!! 🥰🥰🥰 I have seen you first in  ”Dorian Gray”at the cinema, though I was young, in my early twenties, and though I even deeply hated the book, you have done an amazing job, even then! But I loved you in “Easy Virtue”! And I adore your album!  In this series, though you are more good-looking than what I have pictured reading the books, you are still rocking it because I totally despise your character 😆 like in the books! And that means A LOT!👏👏👏 since I consider you a super sweet and handsome man!   


MY QUESTION:

Did you tried other characters in the show before be assigned to the General Kirigan? Or did you choose to do that role? Or were you being contacted only for that character?   


thank you 🙏 

I wish you well and have a lovely evening!

😘😘😘"
Mia and Me,"hi bin bons, have you seen supernatural and would you ever consider working with jensen ackles?"
Mia and Me,"Do you think The Darkling is right about that the path he wants to follow is the best for Ravka? 
Because after reading Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom I think that if The Darkling were ruling, the Grisha would never be THAT threatened."
Mia and Me,When can we see you and Andrew Garfield together on screen? Hopefully in a Comedy? Or any other genre.
Mia and Me,do you think the darkling and magneto would be friends
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I would give anything for this.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Please god
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,yes please
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I would be all in
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Yes! Do it! :-)
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I live for this show.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,And Billy Drago :(
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Same
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Just don’t have it on Starz
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Same!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,You don't know Jack
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Sho Nuff!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,You love to hear it
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,">Episodes dropping on Disney+... the very next day after airing on Disney Channel

Owl House fans: **Are you** ***FUCKING*** **kidding?!**"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,This show is hella cute. Glad Lara Jill Miller is still voice acting. Loved her as Juniper Lee.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"Man, between this, Party Down and Yellowjackets, this has been a particularly good time for me to be watching television. I'm so excited. This was one of the surprisingly best things I saw in the last year."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,They're doing that for the final episode of The Owl House as well.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I love her as Lambie in Doc Mcstuffins, her voice acting is super charming"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,It wouldn't *be* the final episode if they were doing this from the start!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Fred Fredburger was a name known by every kid at my middle school.

Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,DESTROY US ALL!
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Clowns hate tangelos
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,One of Cartoon Network’s best and a true shame the whole series isn’t on DVD.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Scrape and lick.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!

Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Please pass the egg salad.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Loved billy’s relationship with his adopted spider son
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [“Why won’t you love me dad?! I’ll be anything you want me to be!”](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Loved it
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Definitely a favorite of mine
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order
Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures,"I still, to this day, reference the root beer fountain episode.

Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"It doesn't explicitly say in the review, but are most of these characters teenagers? Because I just watched the trailer, and most of the cast looks really young."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Just in time to get cancelled prematurely, right? Right?"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Man, SyFy  sucks.

Can we get more shows like Dark Matter, Killjoys etc? Why so hard."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,">finds its own groove as a bit of exciting, undemanding fun.

It's always a good sign for a show when a reviewer uses a word like ""undemanding,"" a term only used to describe shows that serve no purpose other than to consume hours between now and your death with something more stimulating than staring at a wall."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I’ve watched 15 minutes and I already hate everyone
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Holy crap. I don't care if this review claims it gets good at episode 4. I just watched the first 20 minutes and had to turn it off. The writing is terrible, every character is absolutely insufferable, and the logic behind the entire premise is ridiculous. 

What kind of idiots planned this mission? You're telling me that when planning a multi-year journey where the entire ship is automated and everyone is in cryostasis, no one thought, ""Hey, maybe we should spread out where all the senior command officers are sleeping in case there's an accident?""

Nah, let's put every single high ranking officer in the same bay. Because obviously when the entire ship is sleeping at the same time, it absolutely matters that people are segregated by rank.

Worst. Business continuity plan. Ever.

Edit: Also, this was mentioned in the review, but the theme music is so out of place with the tone of the show. Who okayed that? It's like some OG Battlestar Galactica shit (though to be fair to the original BSG, that music was completely in line with that era of TV)."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I got to the scene where the horticulturist shows the ""acting"" leader his hidden soil and she didn't even realize they could grow food in it. That is as far as I could get. If it's going to get better, then I'll read about it getting better and come back to it. I doubt that it will."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Just watched the first episode.   SPOILER ALERT

The plot is so full of holes.  It is not smart science fiction.  All the command leaders, teachers, and mentors are in one pod that is destroyed. You would never put all the experts in one pod  lost, would leave the trainees to fend for themselves.  

As the episode moves forward, it turns out that no one is who they appear to be or do things that hand-picked, trained individuals no matter how young simply would not do.

So it might turn out to be a fun watch, but it does not appear it will be a smart science fiction series."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"The special effects are some of the worst I've seen in any show, ever.  The writing is very, very bad, the acting is even worse.  It's cringey on all levels.  Avoid this show as you would the bubonic plague or anthrax."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I wish they wouldn't be using technology from 90s TV shows...
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I had high hopes... that was my first mistake..

The special effects are poor..

The set looks like it was made at a highschool.. the caution tape felt so out of place, the helmets make zero sense, somehow they supply air tight oxygen in vacuum yet they look like they don't even fit on the characters heads and shoulders snug or properly.. the stars outside the bridge window look like space confetti..

The acting is subpar, you don't get attached to any characters on the first episode, and they feel pretty dumb for characters who specialize in the top of their career choices.. 

The plot is generic, there is nothing to grasp your attention at all, it feels badly written tbch, the soil.. the water.. the issues that arise... all bland, plain and boring.

After ALL that I'm still going to give it 1 or 2 episodes, why? Because after SGU ended there has been almost nothing interesting to air.. and maybe this trainwreck will find something to momentarily interest me."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Any show they put teenagers and they fuck up, the 100, walking dead world beyond and such."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"The showrunners are Dean Devlin (*Leverage*) and Jonathan Glassner (*Stargate SG-1, The Outpost*) and the show's on SyFy. What were they expecting? *The Expanse?*  ""Not great, but still fun"" is exactly where my expectations are dialed in for this one."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"My God is this show horrible.

I had to take a break when they drained the ship of all energy to power the grow lamps for plants that are still seeds in the ground. Holy shit. You don't even have to know anything about space.

And then this serbian bullshit I only recognized when I saw the credits.
This is made in Serbia by Balkan studios.

I understand now why they felt the huge importance to let characters say they are serbian. Clearly in the future with a global space Agency people will still care about such small nationalities or countries in general. Serbias rampant nationalism is uncomfortably showing"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,they look like they bought their space helmets in the value village halloween section
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I'm watching the pilot now and I literally want to throat punch almost every single character... The talk too fast girl and the nerd farmer and the slutty blonde and shady for no reason couple that are probably brother and sister and the clearly intentional asshole. Throat punch them AAALLLLLLL!

I do, however, like the three Lieutenants and the kid with the oxygen tanks.

And the plot is actually pretty interesting.  Tone down the stupidity of the support cast and maybe it could be ok?"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I want them all to die as it’s too stupid to go on.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,This show is so fucking awful. We ended the misery after 25 insufferable minutes.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Is anyone else getting a 1994 Babylon 5 feeling from the CGI?
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Why are there always emotionally stunted pinheads ""hand-picked"" to travel in space? I mean, I try not to be too critical with these types of shows, but come on, most of the characters wouldn't pass a psychological test for common sense, let alone space travel. And thus ends my rant."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,This crap is below FreeForm channel standards
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich are like two men lost in a forest searching for each other again.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"oh jesus another life spin off?

it's already stupid after 3 min...why put every commanding officer in the same place.."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Whatever happen to syfy's Battlestar Galactica and Stargate SG-1 caliber of series. BSG felt so freaking epic.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"It's looks so cheap and the dialogue is horrendous. There are so many issues with this show that I just couldn't take it more after watching about half of episode one. Mind you I'm a huge sci-fi fan so I gave it more than I normally would have. This was just painful. 

I don't get it why the producers feel the need to make it feel so unrealistic? This isn't the first show and it won't be the last that does the exact same thing with the same result which is a terrible show that tanks quickly. 

I could go on but enough is enough. I really do not recommend watching this, you have been warned."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I was so looking forward to this show. Not sure i'll even give it a go now.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,This article title was a rollercoaster
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,This is the worst show ever
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"what has happened to creative thinking on tv.  past shows, 100, 12Monkeys, Killjoys, Expanse, all great shows.  Today we get the Ark, rediculous and frustrating.  Way to unrealistic responses by all. Yes sci fi but there is still reality to answer to otherwise unrelatable. Who wants to watch a bunch of people in a SPACESHIP acting like teenagers instead of adults running an advanced spaceship. Again, where are the creative writers?"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"When you have shows like the Expanse setting the bar for excellence, shows like this look like a bunch of 14 years olds wrote the script."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Taking four episodes to get good is probably a bad thing for this show's longevity.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Hellooo?? Raised by Wolves did it better and way original
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,ChatGPT can write a better title.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Just started watching the first episode and it is hilariously bad.

Sorry but I grew up on Stargate SG1.

The CGI was bad then, but the stories were mostly good and the actors actually acted.

This is the for sure worse then that Katee Sackhoff Netflix thing.

WoW!

The CGI is 2000's B-List video game, the dialogue is from another universe.

OMG, I think I have to give this a shot, until my cringe-meter overflows.

Man. This is hard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

OMG she really said ""God help us!"". Please let this be satire! xDDDD"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Damn, I hadn't even heard of this. I'm an aspiring screenwriter with a pilot that takes place on an ark-like ship, though it's not a disaster piece, more of a slow-burn murder mystery. Nevertheless, something like this failing just makes it even harder for mine to get read."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Is this the show they wrote for the podcast ""Let's Make a Sci-Fi""?"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"This story has been done so many times before

I liked raised by wolves better"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Not all shows have to be great.  Some can simply be entertaining.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Is this on a streaming service, as it's 2023 and I don't have basic cable any more."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Does anyone know if this show has a subreddit? This is basically the first new television show I've watched in years.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Episode 1 is available on Peacock in the US. It’s NOT The Expanse. Further judgement is reserved and I will not spoil it for anyone.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I’m sorry.  I loved the 100.  This prequel is shit so far.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I grew up on 90' TV series, so for me, the ""quality"" of cgi or else isn't really fundamental at this point. Because the acting, the dialogues, the situations, the background are so horrendous the SFX don't really matters here.

I'm a big fan of Stargate franchise. I agree to say ""Stargate Universe"" was the weakest from all three shows, but i think it had the most ambitious concept for a third spinoff.

But when i compare The Ark with Stargate Universe, i just laugh. It's like comparing a teenager fan-fiction with a professional writer ongoing since years. And it's just about the writing.

Universe had a lot of flaws, but the SFX, the background, the ships, the setting... It was really convincing compared to the Ark. Don't talk about the acting, they had a lot of ""newbies"", they were 100x more good than anyone on The Ark so far. We also had this real feeling of military crew, civilians, REAL genius, and PROFESSIONAL IN THEIR DOMAIN OF EXPERTISE, when the main focus at first was: the wrong people in the wrong place.

Now look at The Ark: it's a PREPARED ONGOING crew, NOBODY seems like someone really selected for a colony. Beyond their age, they ALL act like kids, yelling, pesting, contesting EVERYTHING in one episode, in CRISIS SITUATION.

Beyond that, you have reactions like this: ""i'm in charge of wastes management for this ship... What, using poop as fertilizer? Whoooooooooooou""

I mean, how would you take seriously any character acting like that, in space, after a huge problem. And the other ""genius"", the ""horticultor"". The guy is some kind of prodigy who has x masters and able to grew up plants on desert... What he does? soil + water + heat + light = food. And the leader is impressed by that? Also, he apparently ""hide"" HUGE containers of soil, without nobody noticed, on a fuckin' spaceship. Sure.

I mean... I was really hyped when i heard about The Ark. Don't know why. Maybe i forgot we live in SNS era for 1 sec, where good show means ""diversity"" instead of real thoughts.

The Ark is the mere representation of what happens when you produce a show for gen-Z, you end with gen-Z inside of it, thinking they are qualified because it's on the paper they got on happy meal.

This show feels like ""drama teen space reality show"".

Anyone with a minimum of knowledge (i mean knowing, not letting smartphone searching the answer at any question), can see this series has the most absurd bullshit writing, coupled with childish behavior, unnecessary exposure of ethnicity and various cast to the point it's absurd (really, you have an helmet in space, you don't really do a BIG frizzy cut where you would suffocate by putting your helmet on, or you really don't wear a fucking scarf to show other you're Serbian by origin... And it keeps going on).

Also, just in case, in a space ship going to build a colony, i don't think you hire ""security guards"" to maintain order, because the crew should be selected by the most important people able to build a colony. And by the way, they have stowaway. On a spaceship, on a mission to do a colony, where people must be controlled, selected, etc, they have people able to ""steal"" identity to take place. Sure. The explanation?

Stowaway dude: ""you think you can hack identity and not dna controller?""... And with that, gen-z stop thinking.

I have one for you: ""you think..."" No, you don't think, that's the point.

You want me to believe the most absurd ""plot need it fact""? Sure, MAKE IT BELIEVABLE. Don't care if it's resurrection, false identity, breathing in space Leia Force style, put some effort in the writing of the explanation beyond a line of dialogue.

For Pete's sake, it's just one episode, it's everything i hate: absurd behavior, childish behavior, insufferable characters, bullshit situation (you have a leak of oxygen, some device close the doors where oxygen tanks are, you have to ""charge"" oxygen on ""helmet"" manually)...

Big news, Helmet don't provide oxygen, that's not the function, that's why you have tank. Also, a helmet without a suit really will not save you in space. Really feels like writers think you can survive in space or in a depressurize state with just some air.

Like this scene where leader girl activate something on her tablet without gloves in a depressurize situation...

Also, the suits... Yeh... you have suit that can help you walk because? They're special? Yeh... At least, make 1% of effort into the idea. You suffer post-cryogenic state, i don't think a pressured suit will help you to walk... Also, you have those suits, but you need to push a button on a tablet to force the rotating gravity system that is blocked by... What again? Sure, when i hit my remote, i repair it, that's the way. I can go to space do what leader do apparently.

My gosh, the more i write, the more i think again about how shitty this show is, and it's just about the first episode.

Is it what writers are nowadays? kids thinking writing something on a blog means being professional journalist? So here it's because they wrote 2 lines of dialogues between teenagers saying poop is disgusting, they're able to wrote sci-fi show situation?

... I don't know if it's me, but i really had this feeling of if people like this show, they are really dumb as fuck. Enjoying and seeing it's trash, i get it, that's one thing. But thinking this is a good show? Maybe without knowledge, sure, everything could be great. After all, there is still people truly believing earth is flat in 2023.

Guess this show is for them."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I watched the first episode,  I could live with the plot holes in the science, I could live with the odd characters. I actually liked the two nerdy ones. I can relate to babble mode when nervous.
However. Two things knocked me right out of immersion and the latter made me  say nope not watching ep 2.

The first one was the hacking of the door that was locked on R deck, the people trapped in there were all maintenance crew. You are trying to tell me none of them could unlock it?? Srysly??? It took the oxygen tank guy literally seconds and no one in there could at all? Wtf

The other was the medical scene, where the guy dies. The doctor sees him stop breathing,gives drugs, his heart stops beating, gives drugs. Brain goes red, gives up. . . .where the f was the CPR????? 
I could forgive a lot but that? It's a basic first aid skill that everyone on board should know, it still might not have worked he could still have died but they didn't even try I'm nopping out of this one"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"How does a show even get green lit for a season, when it's so generic"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"(Spoilers) The teens are hard to care about but the appalling science is worse.  1. No comet half way between stars is going to have a shiny tail; 2. when going to the absolute closest star to earth, no stars fly by the port you are looking out.   Lastly,  they are apparently most of the way to their destination,  but need to get ""back to close to light speed ""  they should be trying to slow down and no engines means continually moving at the same speed they were at, they don't suddenly slow down when they shut off."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Why does any of the ship spin when they apparently have artificial gravity everywhere?

The complete disregard of science in this is grotesque."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,It's a sad day when everyone's forgotten Ascension (miniseries) to bad it never went further that ending was epic
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I just watched the first 20 mins if episode 1. Dear god this is awful. Acting sucks, direction sucks. Sets are bargain basement. Sheesh"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Am I the only one who can't take the lack of physics as we know it?  Examples include: cryo pods are in a rotating center section I assume to create the centrifugal force that simulates gravity but they are on the wrong side (inside of spin). BUT the most forward section does not spin and it has gravity? So why any spinning section if they have magic gravity?

Also, when a part breaks off the spinning section, it would go out and away not forward. 

Also, if they were more than 1/2 way they would be decelerating not accelerating. Also, when the engine stops they would not be dead in space. 

I could go on and on..."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,This show is complete garbage and if I didn't know any better I would think this show was written by chat gpt.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,it scratches the Battlestar Galactica and Lost itch. Truly terrible CGI and some basic acting but it's like a soap opera in space with a compelling premise and I'm hooked so far. I highly recommend it
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Great show! Starting to get into it!
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"So this show does suck no ones wrong.  For a space opera you do need at least 1 or 2 likeable characters.

But that's not my main problem, this show isn't going back and stealing ideas from like..7th season deep space 9, or firefly or some older obscure...  they ripping off the friggin orville!"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"These are the most petty annoying characters I'm thinking if we could round up those same folks all of them & put them on arks it would be such a blessing for the rest of us, their constantly in life or death senerios but they don't care about any single person but theirs selfs so steal water let someone else go without good concept but you can't have so many idiots & just 5 sane people it's a no win senario"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I'm going to take acting classes and a time machine to be an actor on this show just so I can punch Brice in the face. You're welcome.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"This show is atrain wreck I can't look away from- they are supposedly on their way to proxima centauri- the closest star to earth, but they keep exploring other planets and star systems on the way. also when their engines die in deep space they stop moving, in direct violation o conservation of momentum. I could go on but I just keep wondering if all of these anomalies are going to turn out to be a suggestion that the whole thing is actually some kind of simulation, or if the authors are really too stupid to look up basic science facts on the internet."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I mean honestly if you were sending people light years away wouldn't you send younger people that wouldn't have to be replaced and could stand a better chance at conceiving children.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"They should stop with all this teenager crap in sci-fi and fantasy! Every time they add a teenager to a known franchise, they ruin it. Look what they did to Resident Evil and Halo."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Surprisingly not. I looked it up after watching the trailer and most of the cast are in their 30's. But they certainly cast people who look far younger than they are.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,most adults  act like teens in shows. so it doesnt make a difference
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Not teens, but twentysomethings I think."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"We really enjoyed The 100, but we preferred the stories focused on the adults rather than the idiot kids."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"this show makes is so bad.............

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

words fail me"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"No. Most of the characters are meant to be older; we only have two main characters so far who are teenagers (like, 19).  This isn't a YA series."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Some are/some aren't.  This show is horrible, I mean horrible, and I watch all the cheesy Syfy & Sci-fi stuff and love it."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"SyFy + Peacock = Oh, it's getting cancelled."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,They renewed Reginald the Vampire. . . . .   Although I think that one is super cheap.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"“Prematurely?” Based on this review and that trailer, I think cancellation is completely justified here and timely."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Dude SyFy in 2015 was fucking fire. Killjoys. Dark Matter. Mother Fucking The Expanse. The Magicians. 12 Monkeys. All in the same fucking year.

God what a great few years on that channel."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,SciFi was great until they rebranded as SyFy.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,It’s bizarre how Syfy blew the transition to streaming. Us nerds and geeks would pay for Syfy+ or whatever to get some quality space shows
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"There is still Chucky! 

Now if they'd only add Season 2 to Peacock..."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Those don't sound like professional wrestling shows to me...
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Because SyFy can't afford it. They don't have the audience to generate the kind of money these shows require.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Or The Expanse or Firefly? Oh wait! Those WERE syfy shows, and their programming geniuses cancelled them. God, the place is managed by a bunch of grammar school kids."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I mean, people didn't watch those shows either, that's the problem. They wouldn't cancel shows if they had the audience for it"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Well thanks for ruining TV for me.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,It’s like watching snails race or as exciting as watching paint dry. The thrill never stops
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"That's a rave review for a Science Fiction show too. You know, the genre often used to explore modern issues in an unassuming way that people can ingest, not feel offended by, and just *maybe* look at from a different perspective? Their opinions might not change, but they're more likely to if exposed to different viewpoints.

Undemanding. Science Fantasy then. Well, it is Syfy. They cut the Sci Fi out of themselves long, long... long, long, long ago."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,">hours between now and your death with something more stimulating than staring at a wall.
        
That hit close to home. Oof."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I checked Wikipedia and many of these people have acted professionally before, but I'm not sure I believe it"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,SAAAAAAAMMMEEEEE!!!!!
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I also hate everyone but I suppose there's at least an in-show reason -- all the smartest people got killed in the first 3 minutes.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"It's funny how the honest reviews saying ""This show sucks"" got buried underneath a thousand reply thread of how annoying teenagers are.

When the producers have to say ""This isn't woke"" in an interview and the paid shell entertainment reporter says ""it fills time"" I just KNOW it will suck flaming balls."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"> the theme music is so out of place with the tone of the show. Who okayed that? 

Honestly after the first couple minutes, the theme music was the only thing that got me to stick it out. It gave me that OG Star Trek mood."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I mean where else are they going to go? The ship's being ripped apart. You don't know what part of the ship would have been safe. The question begs why they weren't awaken first. Plus, if they're spread out away from the command deck...especially on a ship that locks down automatically when oxygen gets low...it'll be hard for them to get there in an emergency.  

Also, the rest of the crew are altogether."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"""growing plants...in soil...YOUR A GENIUS""

you made the right call, I continued past this point, it was a mistake"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"So, Avenue 5 without the gags?"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Lmao yes. When the main character was trying to “activate life support” during the initial cataclysm, she was typing on what looked like an iMac keyboard with a bare hand in a depressurization environment."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I REALLY feel that they should have all watched the Martian in preparation for this voyage... At least as a contingency planning worst case scenario type of training.  Matt Damon could really have taught them a thing or two about rations and teraforming an entire planet on limited supplies and farming with your own poop...
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,the 100 had a long run
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"World Beyond honestly isn't that bad, its just boring writing and a bad script. The actors tried their best."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Except it's not fun. ""Pandora"" was shit and fun. ""The Outpost"" was shit and fun. This ain't it."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I don’t understand the visceral hate from everyone. The pilot was nothing special but I still enjoyed it. And it’s only been one episode lol why can’t we give it some time?
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"I'm a big fan of Dean Devlin's and Jonathan Glassners other (older) work, but there's definitely a strong case to be made that they're still trying to make shows specifically for TV. I'm a huge fan of Stargate, Leverage, the Librarian movies and tv show, and the Outpost had it's moments but man somewhere around Leverage: Redemption you could just tell these guys are getting straight up old. 

It would honestly take too long to vocalize how I think they're just not getting it anymore, but man you can't expect to make passable shows and expect to get 5 seasons and a movie anymore. Most shows are lucky to get past Season 1 nowadays."
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,"Ah yes Outpost, a great show"
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,I don't trust entertainment news anymore.  Your review sounds more like what I would expect.
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,Same
Mako Mermaids: An H2O Adventure,The special effects here aren’t very special… and way below Babylon 5
Ever After High,I want a Hacks/ Veep crossover with the meanest dialogue ever concocted.
Ever After High,"Love this show, glad she is doing ok."
Ever After High,She’s one of my favorite actors. Glad to see she’s recovered well. Can’t wait for season 3.
Ever After High,I had no idea they were doing a season 3. Season 2 finale was written like they did not know if they were getting another round. They wrote off into the sunset from my perspective but excited for it to come back.
Ever After High,Jean Smart is amazing! Glad to read this
Ever After High,I’m kind of surprised that they are doing a season three because season two’s ending was absolutely perfect. I’m in though. I love the show.
Ever After High,"Just looking at this picture, I gotta say, Jean Smart has aged well."
Ever After High,"I first remember seeing and falling in love with Jean in Designing Women. Then I started seeing her in other shows like Frazier, 24 & Fargo. Then one of the first movies I remember was Audrey’s Rain that her real life husband Richard Gilliland co-starred with her. She was in Sweet Home Alabama and other TV Shows & Movies too! ♥️"
Ever After High,Love Jean! Glad she’s doing better
Ever After High,Oh fuck!!!! I assumed we wouldn’t get a season 3. I love this show so much
Ever After High,"Shows got heart 

fr tho , pun aside"
Ever After High,She was great in that show. I didn’t like the writer girl though. She was so not funny that I’m surprised she didnt get a Netflix show. Seems like every not funny woman comic has one.
Ever After High,"loved season 1, season 2 was a lot less funny imo."
Ever After High,"I would watch a show about Jean Smart brushing her teeth for an hour every week, but I really don't like Hacks much.  It feels like they just took a bunch of fun actors and were like ""We've got a bland story here, please don't add anything to it."""
Ever After High,Who?
Ever After High,Jean Smart has to be one of the greatest character actors of her time.  Her range is impressive and what she brings to life is something palpable.  Love to see how she can hold her own in a scene and make her mark.
Ever After High,"Jean Smart in everything please

I wanna see a Jean Smart/Jennifer Coolidge show"
Ever After High,"I like Hacks quite a lot but it is totally different to Veep. Sure, Hacks has some vicious insults, but Veep’s heartlessness was on a whole different level. Hacks is ultimately a far kinder show than Veep. It’s not exactly Ted Lasso level schmaltz or anything but it definitely ain’t Veep."
Ever After High,"Yeah, she's amazing. She also lost her husband while shooting the first season so she's had a rough few years."
Ever After High,"Man, ""wrote off into the sunset"" almost works here..."
Ever After High,"I would have been content if it ended with S2, but I’m glad we will (hopefully) see the two women come back to each other. The breakup between the two was tough love that they both needed at those different points in their career which will make the reuniting that much better."
Ever After High,IIRC they did not know if they were getting a season 3. It was not renewed until months after S2 was released.
Ever After High,Have you watched the show?  She's a goddamn babe.
Ever After High,"season 2 felt much more sinister with the like abusive relationships taking a much more center stage

Maybe it's just that season1 was a funnier take on abusive relationships. It makes me wonder what season 3 will feel like cause I think it will be a difficult balance

One of the best shows currently running though so exicted to see what's next"
Ever After High,One thing Hacks and Mrs Maisel taught me is that it’s incredibly hard to write standup comedy. The jokes are just so freaking terrible and it really ruins the illusion.
Ever After High,"I watched a few episodes and it was funny enough, but I refuse to get into any more shows about being a stand up comedian, it's a played out plot at this point."
Ever After High,How dare you
Ever After High,Featuring Christopher McDonald
Ever After High,"Cool. Didn’t really investigate the idea too deeply, but I’m glad someone did their due diligence."
Ever After High,That’s too bad to hear. She’s such a champion.
Ever After High,I realized it was wrong but i left it because it kinda works.
Ever After High,"I feel the same. 

The finale was so satisfying that I would be ok without a third but I still *want* a third season."
Ever After High,"I seem to remember the three producers said in one of the extras featurettes during S2 mention they have a four season arch. Alas, I canceled HBO for the time being and can’t check to confirm."
Ever After High,Her sex scene with Devon Sawa is super hot lol
Ever After High,i hope they get back to Vegas.
Ever After High,"it wasn't that, i kinda expected a dropoff, it was the story lines in season 2, i couldn't get into it, it was all about gay relationships, and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

season 1 was just funny, season 2 i feel they were trying drama, and it didn't work for me.

i still like the premise though."
Ever After High,I have a similar rule about novels about academics.  E-fucking-nough.
Ever After High,With the theme by Michael McDonald.
Ever After High,"She actually filmed the scene where she shows up at the funeral of Ava's dad about a week after Richard Gilliand passed. She absolutely deserved that Emmy, you could feel Jean's whole heart in that monologue in front of the mourners."
Ever After High,holy fuck that was Devon Sawa?!
Ever After High,">and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

You're not okay with that."
Ever After High,Why aren’t you going to watch something with a gay relationship?
Ever After High,"> it was all about gay relationships, and i'm ok with that, but i'm not going to watch it. 

grow up dude"
Ever After High,Right??!?!??
Ever After High,"Yea, homophobic much??!?!?!"
Ever After High,sure.
Ever After High,Because hes obviously a hateful homophobic trumper! Duh what else could it be?
Ever After High,why do you care?
Ever After High,"Yea fr fr, no cap. Only the most grown up, mature people find every show relatable and watchable, regardless of the characters and their stories. They like anything and everything, and everyone. Its lame and immature if you dont."
Ever After High,no
Ever After High,I dunno. That’s why I asked.
Ever After High,Just wondering since you decided to share on a public forum. Curious.
Ever After High,"We assume the worst in everyone here, where have you been?"
Ever After High,"a forum about tv shows, and i critizied a story line."
Ever After High,You’re doing a lot. It’s starting to feel like projection.
Ever After High,"Whoaa, is it?? Are you a mind Doctor or something?"
Ever After High,iTs ReDdIt. Im AsSuMiNg ThE wOrSt 🤪🤪
Ever After High,"What you are doing is fighting the good fight fellow redditor, keep homophones out of our subs"
Ever After High,"Wanna know how it was supposed to end?  Fazekas spilled the beans in [this interview](https://cliqueclack.com/tv/2010/02/01/how-reaper-would-have-ended-straight-from-the-creators/)!

> As for Sam and the question of who his father really was, this one’s a doozy: “If you remember, Dad wasn’t dead. And there was a whole reason why he wasn’t dead. Basically, the whole premise that never actually had the chance to come out was the idea that Dad was a demon, who made a deal with the Devil. He fell in love with Sam’s mom and wanted to marry her. So the deal was, fine, you’re not a demon anymore. He was never fully human, either, which is why you can’t kill him. So, in the pilot, when he said he was really sick and made a deal with the Devil, he wasn’t 100% lying nor 100% telling the truth. And this is the reason why Sam is special: Sam is part human, part demon.”
>
> Boom.
>
> “Sam was led to believe he was the Devil’s son, but that wasn’t true. That’s not the reason Sam had powers — the powers came from his father. His father was really his father. And part of his deal was that he was never really allowed to tell Sam the truth, and that’s the reason why he says to him ‘there’s more to this than I can tell you.’ And part of what we tried to get out of all of this was that Sam really is special. That’s the reason why, at the end of the last season, Steve comes to him and says Sam is caught between good and evil. What we hoped to get out of the third season was what part did Sam have to play? Sam’s whole existence, and the reason the Devil was paying so much attention to him and hanging out with him so much was because there was a reason: Sam was half-human and half-demon, and the Devil was really worried that this kid was going to be his downfall. If you look at what the Devil is doing throughout the series, he’s trying to tempt Sam to be bad. And he’s trying to tempt him to embrace this, that what you’re doing isn’t so bad. The whole point was that if he can turn Sam bad, the Sam isn’t a threat anymore.”

There's a little more besides in [the interview](https://cliqueclack.com/tv/2010/02/01/how-reaper-would-have-ended-straight-from-the-creators/), definitely worth a read."
Ever After High,Ray Wise's Devil is absolute perfection.
Ever After High,"It was a great show that was a victim of the [writer’s strike.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike) Just like Pushing Daisies.

Tyler Labine and Missy Peregrym were fantastic in it too."
Ever After High,Bret Harrison had a couple of good shows that didn't seem to last. I thought he was perfectly capable of carrying a show. It's a shame he didn't become a bigger star.
Ever After High,I enjoyed Reaper. I thought it was an interesting concept and loved how Sock took more enjoyment from soul catching than the main character. And his flirting with the DMV lady was great.
Ever After High,"Reaper was awesome. Right there at the same time as Chuck and the also cancelled too soon Pushing Daisies.

Also love your shout out to Brimstone."
Ever After High,Loved Tyler Labine ever since the breaker high days.
Ever After High,"Loved this silly show.  Ray Wise is, to me, the best Devil.  (Shout out to Tom Ellis, but not the same character!)"
Ever After High,Similar story with Better Off Ted. Way before it's time; it'd be a staple now with everyone realizing we're trapped in this surreal late-stage capitalism reality
Ever After High,"This was one of the few shows I’ve ever talked my parents into watching and it became one of my dad’s favorites. Ray Wise as the devil and the dmv as a portal to hell, just fantastic. He still mentions it sometimes."
Ever After High,Tyler Labine is so underrated and that show was amazing
Ever After High,Here is a [Reaper promo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gtw1wQy2TU&ab_channel=ReaperCW) for those who haven't seen it or seen it lately. It does spoil the whole first episode though. It's too bad it didn't survive. The show was fun from what I remember.
Ever After High,I chose my username because of Reaper. Haven't heard anyone mention it in years lmao
Ever After High,Reaper was so much fun. Is it streaming anywhere?
Ever After High,"Remember flipping through network TV and actually discovering shows? This was one of those shows for me, about halfway through season 1, flipping through when nothing was on, it looked interesting so I watched the rest of the episode. No trailer, no ""this is a match because you watched ______"", and this was at a time when shows (especially network shows) weren't always available next day so I just finished season one trying to piece together what I missed in the previous episodes. I miss how simple it was."
Ever After High,I miss wonderfalls.
Ever After High,Ray Wise played the best Satan ever.
Ever After High,"Loved this show!

I think of it as the comedic TV version of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"
Ever After High,"I was just thinking about Reaper last night!

I was trying to find a show to watch and Deadbeat popped up. It’s an early Hulu show with Tyler Labine playing a slacker medium. Felt like a Sock spinoff, but I couldnt get into it."
Ever After High,Back when someone actually wanted Kevin Smith to direct their pilot
Ever After High,"I have to admit, I watched nearly a full season of New Amsterdam before realizing ""Holy Shit! Iggy is Sock/Dale!""."
Ever After High,Used to watch this show for on Hulu when it was FREE
Ever After High,"Such a FANTASTIC show; perfect mix of story and humor with the supernatural backing. 

Probably could have had the success that Supernatural did if they kept chugging along"
Ever After High,Yes I remember this being one of those “way better than you thought it would be” shows!
Ever After High,"The creators of the show went on to make another show called ""Kevin (Probably) Saves the World"" that's similiar to Reaper but features Jason Ritter tasked with helping people with directions from angels. In one episode, Kevin has to get a Chuck E Cheese-style animatronic for someone and meets up with Sock and Sam who're hiding out from the Devil. 

Shame that the creators of the show can never land a series. Everything they do gets one or two seasons then cancelled with cliffhangers."
Ever After High,Reaper was one of the first shows I ever found as a teenager like fifteen years ago randomly browsing that I instantly clicked with. Was so disappointed the show never got to conclude
Ever After High,Ray Wise is simply brilliant as the Devil. This show was the tits
Ever After High,Reaper was so good
Ever After High,"Absolutely loved reaper, another one that was pretty good horror tv show and it was cancelled because of fox entertaiment being sold, The exorcist. 2 great seasons in my opinion."
Ever After High,A blast from the past! It was a fun and entertaining watch with a great cast
Ever After High,"That show was great! I'd forgotten all about it, thank for the reminder!!"
Ever After High,Love that show
Ever After High,"It was great, especially Ray Wise. I was so bummed when it was cancelled."
Ever After High,"It was a fun show, that managed throughout its two seasons, with interesting plot lines being developed and explored regularly. I was sad when I heard it was cancelled."
Ever After High,I adore this show. I think about the alcoholics anonymous episode a LOT because of both how funny and tragic it is.
Ever After High,I miss this show so freaking much. Sock had me hollering on occasion. Bret Harrison and Ray Wise were perfect. I hate they canceled this because this was really one of my faves. Such a shame.
Ever After High,"Bret Harrison had several pushes from network TV but just never hit. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who watched The Loop, Reaper, and Breaking In in their entireties. The Loop was the only one that was really bad. They threw a lot of talent at Breaking In- Christian Slater, Megan Mullally, Michael Rosenbaum, Ali Wong, Allyssa Milano, Samm Levine and Mike Tyson were all on the show."
Ever After High,"The writers strike killed a lot of good shows at the time, we then got tons of reality TV. I really hope we avoid another one."
Ever After High,"Bret Harrison just could not make a show work for him. I know of at least three lead roles he had in TV shows that didn’t last beyond two seasons: *The Loop*, *Reaper* and *Breaking In*. They were all decent shows that had solid potential. But they all suffered from the same problem: Bret Harrison.

Bret is a good actor. He’s had a number of great performances as supporting characters. But he’s always paired with more charismatic actors. In *The Loop*, he was acting alongside Eric Christian Olsen. In *Reaper*, he had to act alongside veteran actor Ray Wise. In *Breaking In*, most of the scenes he was in got stolen by the incredible Christian Slater.

I like Bret Harrison but he’s just not leading man material."
Ever After High,Almoat as bad as Raised By Wolves😢
Ever After High,">Cancelling 'Reaper' after 2 seasons is still one of the worst decisions ever made by a TV Network

Not for the CW network. The show got really low ratings. It ranked 192nd out of 200 shows the first year and 169th out of 190 shows in year two.  I suspect they renewed it for a second season, hoping that it would catch on but the ratings didn't get much better.  Reaper wasn't owned by CBS or Warner Bros (the owners of CW) so the network had no financial stake in the series. This was before streaming and there was no monetization of delayed viewing. I enjoyed the show but liked the second season less than the first."
Ever After High,Kevin Smith was also involved. Directed the pilot and executive produced.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"wow, these two, they really go back. That's like what, 30 years ago?!"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Took 25 years but he finally hit that.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Chris Rock is wearing a wig because otherwise he would look like GI Jane.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,How can ~~she~~ he slap?!
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,And still Will acted childish and took things to a ridiculous level for a very tame joke.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,[deleted]
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Man I thought this was gonna be some meme'd video editing but this is even better
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I rewatched this episode literally last week and still didn't make the connection in my head
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,[removed]
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,How is this episode still available to watch? Golden Girls and Community episodes are being banned for having blackface. But it's apparently okay to ridicule guys wearing dresses? Yikes.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,They were acting here and they were acting yesterday
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Gasp!
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Well played!
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"I go psycho when my new joint hit

Just can't sit

Gotta get jiggy wit it, ooh, that's it"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"He CAN hit! At this price point, they can hit"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"How do we know Will slapped Chris (besides our own eyes)?

Because they were fresh prints all over Chris Rock’s face"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Jada only likes to be slammed by her SON'S friends, not her husband's."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Or jealous because he's purtier?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Chris *is* a woman here in this role, not trans.

This is probably a lot nicer than casting an actual woman to be ugly or casting a transwoman for this role."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,But this isn't trans. Drag at best and only outside the show.  I'm pretty sure in the context of the show Chris is just playing a cis-woman. Being aware of transphobia is good and all but shooting accusation wildly does not help.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,No it's not...
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Shut up
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,well to be frank this episode has them ridiculing Chris rocks character for being an unattractive woman
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I mean the guy (I assume- apologies if I've misjudged that) isn't wrong. Dunno why all the downvotes
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Nah. Occums Razor.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,[deleted]
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Conspiracy theorists crack me up dude
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,broooooooooo
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Super surprised Vivian 1 is showing up
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Reunions, so hot right now"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Can't wait for Vivian to meet Vivian
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,RIP James Avery.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Ashley was my fantasy girlfriend.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"People outside of the USA - ""I'd pay to watch this""


HBO Max - ""Nope"""
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,#**FIRST THINGS FIRST....**
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Wont be the same without Uncle Phil
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,[removed]
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Rest In Peace to James Avery.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,*The Refresh Prince of Bel-Air*
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"First things first, Rest in peace Uncle Phil"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,TIL I'm still in love with Tatyana Ali.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,[deleted]
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Everyone looks so good. I used to be in love with Ashley. One of my first crushes. RIP James Avery.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,This should have been done when Uncle Phil was alive.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I wish marketing teams would advertise this as a round table rather than a reunion. I think people are going to get confused and think that they are doing a new episode.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,What a shame James Avery isn’t around. :’(
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Two seconds of ""how come he don't want me, man?"" buried in that clip, and I'm in tears.

Again.

Every time."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,[OG Aunt Viv meeting Aunt Viv 2.](https://media1.tenor.com/images/711e6a79134357cfb82e5845162c5c6e/tenor.gif?itemid=18212100)
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Ah shit! This just reminded me that uncle Phil is dead, man."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,RIP Shredder.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"This gave me absolute chills. To me Fresh Prince is the go-to essential sitcom. Been watching it for as long as I can remember.

I was also hoping OG aunt Viv would show up. Really looking forward to this- and it's only a week! I wish all media would just release trailers/be announced this much closer to release."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Real Aunt VIV!!!!!
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Was that Aunt Viv MK1 turning up at the end?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,That cliffhanger.....
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Did we really need the pep talk before the trailer to hype the trailer we're already watching?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Well shit, I'm going to have to subscribe to HBO Max now and I'm already subscribed to Hulu, Crunchyroll, Disney+ and Netflix"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,30 years? Where the hell has the time gone?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"*Sad noises*

It's only on HBO Max."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Aunt Viv #2 done turned into Hillary Clinton.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Stupid onions.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"I miss the golden years for black television. I hope we have a revival of sorts. Good Times, Sanford and Sons, The Jeffersons, Fresh Prince, Cosby Show, What's Happening these shows were the shows I grew up with and made me a better person."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"I was like ""oh, it's just a cast reunion and not an episode"" but then they started talking about James and it hit me. Can't wait to watch this and relive the show again."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Original Aunt Viv was always better. Will be interesting to see her back after a 30 year beef.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Y’all should listen to Live From the Poolhouse podcast. Two people of color host as they go beyond recapping episode by episode and explore how ahead of its time this show was.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,RIP Uncle Phil
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"First thing first, R.i.p Uncle Phil"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Nothing makes me feel like more of a curmudgeon than the feeling I get when I see tv show reunion new.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,This is literally my childhood. I'm so hyped to see this
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Firsts things first, rest in peace Uncle Phil..."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Sad seeing this as a white person who watched this show with his family growing up -- my family's been so intoxicated by Fox and Facebook, remembering that we all used to watch a show about a black family without it even registering because it was so well done and universally appealing seems a lifetime away."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"I shot this Reunion Special, was a lot of fun with some crazy moments."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Fresh Prince was a great show. This reunion looks like a half-assed money grab.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Shut up, you're crying!"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Where can I watch this in the uk

Btw the full show is on Netflix - so could it go to Netflix (we don’t have hbo in the uk)"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Loved this show. Can’t wait for this.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Uncle Phil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We all miss you.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,IT'S REWIND TIME
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"First things first, Rest In Peace uncle Phil"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,So sad that Uncle Phil is gone.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Seriously though. How does Alfonso Ribeiro look like he's still in his 20s?
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"This was hands down my favorite show ever. 

I was so obsessed as a kid that I found out via tv guide when the first episode of the series would air in syndication and started recording them in VHS, in order, commercial free by sitting down and watching them and being ready to press stop record when the commercials would hit.

Oh it doesn't stop there...I made labels on the sides of the VHS labeling the seasons WITH the Fresh Prince show logo.

When complete after pretty much just watching them in its entirety, I started over and fully incorporated many quotes in my daily life from the show. 

I was a pretty cool kid clearly and way ahead of my time."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,First things first rest in peace uncle Phil
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"they all look exactly the same, except for aunt viv's hair"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Nobody's commenting on how Alfonso (Carlton) hasn't aged?  Is that just makeup or a voodoo ceremony that MJ taught to him?  It's been almost 30 years!
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Lost me with HBO MAX. Oh well...
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Wow-what a twist, Vivian 1 ready to stir up the pot!"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I was hoping they would get Andy Borowitz to this reunion because he co-created the show and responsible for developing the style of humor that Smith is known for.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I cannot stand Will Smith.. so corny.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"HBO Max?

Fine, I'll pirate it myself."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I literally JUST finished the series on HBO Max lmao this is awesome. But Uncle Phil man how can it happen without him.
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,I am tired of reboots but perfectly fine with this
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Gonna miss Uncle Phil tho...
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"It's funny how the reboot Fresh Prince won't come to HBOMax after this reunion, you'd think HBO would have rolled the nostalgia all the way in."
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"Why are people so hyped for stuff like this and the Friends reunion? I could see if they were actually specials that took place in universe and were follow ups to the series finales but these are just actor roundtables.

I get why the studios are doing these, cause Covid shut down a lot of productions and actors are bored not working, but I can't understand the excitement from an audience perspective. 

Should be fun though, I have HBO Max and I like behind the scenes stuff so of course I'll check it out at some point. It just isn't an event, you know?"
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Rip unc phil
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,Aka these actors have nothing else going on
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,"YOU HAVE MY CURIOUSITY

The Amazing World of Gumball,That's not good to make kids shows adult.  Like should Sesame Street have become more adult and just ended up getting cancelled in a few years?
The Amazing World of Gumball,"In my opinion, cartoon shows don’t adapt themselves to older audiences: adults are supposed to grow out of kids content."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"This content lives forever. Kids in the future will need to be able to watch this show to completion while they are still children. If it becomes too adult, you’re basically depriving the whole thing from any future generations who may enjoy it.

Find a different show. I know it’s hard and sad but it’s like a campsite. You gotta leave it nice and tidy for whoever comes after you."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"I recommend theodd1sout's Oddballs. It feels very similar to Gumball (thought Gumball was extra meticulous in its ""Every character is a metaphor"" and Oddballs has a lot of crazy for crazy sakeness)"
The Amazing World of Gumball,[deleted]
The Amazing World of Gumball,Ever of heard of Ren and Stimpy: Adult Party Cartoon? This is why we shouldn’t turn kids shows into adult shows.
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Ok Sesame Street was for toddlers, the amazing world of gumball was themed to older kids and had a lot of references that only adults would understand. But television isn’t just a show it’s also art and can be remade interpreted, whatever, and why not? Not like a REALLY VULGAR adaptation. But maybe like TV-14 you know."
The Amazing World of Gumball,Let me enjoy what makes me and many others happy :’(
The Amazing World of Gumball,"For theodd1sout’s Reddit account!

Just kidding, the show is also good."
The Amazing World of Gumball,Yes omg thank god it’s not just me
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Don’t get me wrong, you do you and enjoy whatever, not judging. Just chiming in with my two cents on the reason why I think kids shows don’t grow up and mature alongside their audience."
The Amazing World of Gumball,">Yes omg thank god it’s not just me

Sure you're not just talking to yourself there buddy?"
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Ah, fair I find it cool when I do see it happen though but obviously it shouldn’t be done with things like coco melon or paw patrol respectively. But to me regular show and such makes sense"
The Amazing World of Gumball,This show is so dumb. I love it!
The Amazing World of Gumball,bruh what is that thumbnail
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Gumball it's my favorite cartoon ever, it gets crazier and better each season, it's really good"
The Amazing World of Gumball,"They had a golden girl episode.

It's crazy meta"
The Amazing World of Gumball,I start watching it thanks to my kids and now I am a bigger fan of it then them
The Amazing World of Gumball,Is this the show with the hot mom that gets in a DBZ styled battle with another character?
The Amazing World of Gumball,Can’t wait for the movie
The Amazing World of Gumball,"I love Gumball - it's my favorite CN show that I've seen but I think its subversiveness prevents people from becomig  as invested in it as - say - Adventure Time. There are real emotions in Gumball but the show constantly pulls the rug out from under you in ways that are clever and funny in the moment but ultimately deprives the show of the sincerity of  Adventure Time or Steven Universe. I think that makes people feel like it's a clever gag factory and not something they are supposed to  connect with.   

That's not a bad thing! Not every show is going to make you care the way AT did, but I think it explains why a show that is so brilliantly animated and written is overlooked by so many people.   


Anyway, this has been another episode of Boring Animation Nerd Corner."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"It was great but Regular Show, Steven Universe and Adventure Time over shadowed it. I'd argue out of all those shows Gumball had the fewest bad episodes. It was pretty consistent not counting the awkward first season."
The Amazing World of Gumball,It’s an extremely smart sitcom with glorious animation and adult humour
The Amazing World of Gumball,I totally agree. Its funny af and sometimes it even has some suble critics to society. If it was on Netflix it would probably be way more famous.
The Amazing World of Gumball,I always consider it as South Park for kids.
The Amazing World of Gumball,Don’t should on us guys.
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Completely agreed. It’s so insane to me that the show evolved from a comedic, light-hearted sitcom to a darkly-comedic social satire. You saw sort of the early workings in the show’s sardonic nature with S1 episodes like the DVD and then the series hits full throttle with other episodes lampooning censorship, politics, social inequality, disability, etc. It really came into its own (relatively shortly mine you!).

I’m so glad that it’s getting a spin-off as well. I’m expecting Mic Graves to produce another well-written project that will knock it out of the park."
The Amazing World of Gumball,There is also a staggering amount of rule 34 for it.
The Amazing World of Gumball,It's really fucking good. Try it on L.
The Amazing World of Gumball,The episodes with the Hot Dog guy are pure cringe...pure comedy cringe
The Amazing World of Gumball,The banana guy screaming as he is squeezing out his innards because he dropped his weight benchpressing is the most fucked up thing I have seen on tv.
The Amazing World of Gumball,the amazing world of gumball is good
The Amazing World of Gumball,"It is. But that's actually one of the very few scenes that are animated differently from the rest of the show, they blew their budget out on that though."
The Amazing World of Gumball,">but ultimately deprives the show of the sincerity of  Adventure Time or Steven Universe.

I was kind of with you until you mentioned Steven Universe.

Seriously, Steven Universe? That show is ***terrible*** and this is coming from someone who was a cringey SU fan once. Not to mention that the most popular show on CN was actually Gumball, Steven Universe doesn't even come close which is why they only gave it few time slots on the schedule when it was airing.

Also Gumball isn't a plot-driven show. They have few sub-plots like The Void and Gumball's relationship with his girlfriend...etc but that's more like a bonus and an addition. Gumball is supposed to be a comedy show."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Steven Universe is not my cup of tea personally, but to claim that it’s “terrible” is absolutely insane. It’s obviously a quality program, it has a massive fan base and an arguably cult following. Just because something doesn’t float your boat it doesn’t mean it’s terrible."
The Amazing World of Gumball,">Gumball is supposed to be a comedy show.  

I know that's what I was getting at with my long winded post. Also I only watched a bit if steven universe so I guess it was a bad example but know it had a very loyal following - and it was VERY sincere."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Every show has a cult following. Every damn show even stuff like MLP has a cult and fandom.

And I say this as somebody who once liked SU(I was cringe as fuck, I know)

SU literally redeemed 3 Hitlers in one episode with 1 line of dialogue each. That's beyond shitty writing and that's just a small example of how terrible it is."
The Amazing World of Gumball,Find something worthwhile to be that angry about my dude.
The Amazing World of Gumball,"But it's the basis of the entire show. That everyone is a flawed being, capable(and deserving) of love and empathy. And that there's no point in punishment when rehabilitation is possible. It's one of the strongest through lines of a show I've seen, from episode 1 to the finale and beyond.

Not to be a bitch, but I'm kinda getting a ""I liked this as a 15yo and need to distance myself from that person""-vibe."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"How am I angry? You said something and I said something back. 

I'm actually baffled at how this subreddit has a liking to SU since SU is usually a show that has a very bad reputation on the internet besides specific places."
The Amazing World of Gumball,">But it's the basis of the entire show. That everyone is a flawed being, capable(and deserving) of love and empathy. And that there's no point in punishment when rehabilitation is possible. It's one of the strongest through lines of a show I've seen, from episode 1 to the finale and beyond.

By redeeming 3 big villains with one line each? In the same episode?

No, just no. No matter what you're going to say, it's terrible."
The Amazing World of Gumball,I’ve literally never heard anyone say anything bad about SU until you. It seems pretty universally beloved.
The Amazing World of Gumball,r/CharacterRant literally keeps dissing it.
The Amazing World of Gumball,Oh. Cool. One weird niche subreddit. That definitely speaks for the entire internet.
The Amazing World of Gumball,"You just said ""Universally beloved"" and I gave you an example of how it isn't universally beloved.

There are countless places on Reddit that hates it too like r/cringetopia...etc in addition to Youtube.

Steven Universe is a very bad show with shitty writing that is supposed to send a message to kids over actually delivering. I'm actually surprised this subreddit likes it."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"It’s gonna be ok man. Steven Universe isn’t real, he can’t hurt you."
The Amazing World of Gumball,It's not gonna be ok man. People who hate SU exist and they can hurt you if you're a snowflake.
The Amazing World of Gumball,I’m not the one vehemently defending their hatred for a children’s cartoon am I?
The Amazing World of Gumball,"I'm not the one insulting people for not loving a children's cartoon, am I?"

The Amazing World of Gumball,I know a bunch of child psychiatrists that are going to get rich.

The Amazing World of Gumball,[Slow motion horror] Ohhhhhhh nooooooo!!!!!!
The Amazing World of Gumball,Green is not a creative color!
The Amazing World of Gumball,I wonder how much puppet body horror they'll be able to get away with
The Amazing World of Gumball,"The show is so underrated, it's seriously so good. It's definitely not only for children"
The Amazing World of Gumball,"As an adult with no kids who watches adult swim at nights, i randomly had the tv on during the day and this show was on and i just happened to catch a few minutes. Many of the jokes and themes are incredibly adult for a children's show. There is no way children would understand a third or more of what I've seen.  I now find myself actually sitting through episodes and searching clips on youtube because some of the humor is just awesome and has me in stitches.  

TL:DR- This show is full of adult humor (not every episode) and is worth checking out. 

EDIT: Examples of adult humor:

1. A rule 34 reference?

2. ""Contouring""

The Amazing World of Gumball,Idk how horrified I should be. 
The Amazing World of Gumball,"While we're at it:

1. Can the mods of this sub please add a Gumball flair?

2. /r/gumball needs some love too. Pls pay us a visit."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"The best episode of Gumball is when the dad gets a job and the universe begins to fall apart because of it, the animation and creativity in that episode is amazing! This excites me"
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Gumball is amazing in it's experimental episodes. Shows stories that not only can only be told through that medium, but can only be told as part of TAWOG "
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Hooooooly shit. One of my favorite animated shows on TV meets the most bonkers thing on the internet. Get hype.

If you're here for the Don't Hug Me I'm Scared part, I implore you to give Gumball a shot. It's a wonderful mix of crazy animation techniques (every other character not in the Waterson family has their own unique style of animation), perfect slapstick and wordplay, and genuine heart in a lot of places. Super underrated show that kind of get buried behind stuff like Adventure Time and Steven Universe (my other favorite show on the network). Most of it is up on Hulu right now and the episodes are 15 minutes a piece. Please check it out. "
The Amazing World of Gumball,New levels of quality tv now exist.
The Amazing World of Gumball,Amazing world of gumball is one of the best cartoon shows of the last 10 years. I think this is one of those shows that are going to be massive 10 years after it's cancelled. 
The Amazing World of Gumball,"I sometimes wish Gumball would get a bigger following, but I've seen a lot of the things I like get tainted by their own fandoms."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Sounds interesting. I like both series, they have the same type of fourth wall breaking so it will work"
The Amazing World of Gumball,[deleted]
The Amazing World of Gumball,Green is not a creative colour. 
The Amazing World of Gumball,I'm just here to gush about Gumball.

The Amazing World of Gumball,"No one seems to have started this yet soooo...

What's your favorite idea?"
The Amazing World of Gumball,Can't wait to bust out some aspic and see this.
The Amazing World of Gumball,"Youtube transitioning to TV hasn't always worked, remember The Amazing Orange Show? I don't want to remember it. I really do hope this works though, and for a single episode I predict it will be fine."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"This show looks stupid on the outside, but it actually has gotten genuine laughs out of me...consistently. Plus, some of the scenes and jokes are actually very clever. That, and the animation is trippu and amazing as hell, I like how it's a mesh of different techniques used by cartoons so far, right down to that ""upside down chin with googly eyes"" joke."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"This show is really worth a watch. After the first season they seemed to realise that it wasn't children watching the show, it was stoned students. It's catered to that and it's amazing. "
The Amazing World of Gumball,Oh no.
The Amazing World of Gumball,I freaking love this show. I watch it all the time when im on lsd or shrooms
The Amazing World of Gumball,How are those people allowed to direct an animation episode from the inside of an asylum solitary room
The Amazing World of Gumball,My kids watch this. I don't know what to say in reference to anything Gumball related. It really weirds me out. 
The Amazing World of Gumball,"God, I honestly think Gumball may be one of the best modern cartoons I've ever seen. Like while shows like Steven Universe handle drama well, Gumball has some of the best humor I've seen in a kids cartoon. From having no 4th wall, to not caring about the censors, to even anime and game references (to the point where they got an anime animator). Its so wonderful."
The Amazing World of Gumball,"TAWOG is my favorite CN show! From the Kill la Kill homage to their FFVII parody episode, they totally cater to my ""nerd culture"" needs"
The Amazing World of Gumball,This show is weird!
The Amazing World of Gumball,"That's awesome! I love DHMIS, I hope this episode has the requisite disturbing, strange humor and symbolism."
The Amazing World of Gumball,I wonder if they'll have the DHMIS characters pop up in a background cameo.

The Amazing World of Gumball,"Let me guess, on Father's day?"
H2O: Just Add Water,They gonna kill em all and then one of them will time travel and save them all for a happy ending.
H2O: Just Add Water,that means one of the og cast is gonna die if there's no new characters to kill off
H2O: Just Add Water,Hoping to see Mr. Clarke one last time before the show is over.
H2O: Just Add Water,"- **Duffer brothers** ***Hope ‘Stranger Things’ Will Do for a New Generation What ‘Scream’ Did for Them.***

**Ross Duffer said :**

> We’re doing our best to resist [adding new characters] for Season 5. We’re trying not to do that so we can focus on the OG characters, I guess.

**Matt Duffer :**


> Whenever we introduce a new character, we want to make sure that they’re going to be an integral part of the narrative. **So that’s something with Eddie this season, where we go, ‘Well, we need a character here for this storyline to really work, and to give it the engine that is needed.’** But every time we do that, we’re nervous, because you go, ‘We’ve got a great cast of characters here, and actors, and any moment we’re spending with a new character, we’re taking time away from one of the other actors.’ **So we’re just very, very careful about who we’re introducing.**"
H2O: Just Add Water,"I enjoyed season 4 a lot, but it definitely suffered from being overstuffed with characters. I love David Harbour but the entire Russia side plot just felt so unnecessary"
H2O: Just Add Water,"They spent most of Season 4 teasing either Steve or Nancy getting killed off. They had them have a romantically tinged reconciliation of sorts, and hinted heavily to them getting back together, only for them to now turn it into a love triangle of sorts for the final season. One of those three will die, likely either Steve or Jonathan."
H2O: Just Add Water,"So... they've not ruled out bringing back old/dead characters? Calling it now, Eddie will come back somehow."
H2O: Just Add Water,Balki Bartokomous shows up to live with Mike and the series is renamed ***Perfect Stranger Things.***
H2O: Just Add Water,"Huh, no love interest for Will"
H2O: Just Add Water,"They should do whatever they please, they have delivered a great story so far, no reason to tell them how to end it."
H2O: Just Add Water,Jonathan dying to save Will and Joyce would be fully acceptable to me.  But it will probably be Steve and I’ll never recover.
H2O: Just Add Water,But then who are they gonna kill off?
H2O: Just Add Water,Barb is gonna be brought back to life only to sacrifice herself so no main characters die
H2O: Just Add Water,"Every Season synopsis: misunderstood person enters sleepy town and becomes an antihero savior while one ancillary character dies, and villain gets routed yet again by the scooby doo gang.  Mean while they mix an unlikely duo together for endearing comedic relief

Still a great show but they have that formula they reuse so damn effectively well. I’ll take another season 4 with more or less the same mix any day"
H2O: Just Add Water,"I think it’ll just be minor new characters, none on the level of a max or robin or Eddie. I also fully expect them to kill off one of the OGs, I think they’ve just been saving the main death for the final season because they didn’t want to make full seasons of the show without any of the main crew."
H2O: Just Add Water,Doing that is often a problem in stories where the main cast is a Swiss Army knife for the plot.
H2O: Just Add Water,They need to bring Eddie back from the dead so he can play a solo of “For Whom The Bell Tolls” on top of the video store then murder everyone. 🤘
H2O: Just Add Water,"Ehhh. I hated how they introduced such a good character this last season just to kill them off so the main cast could live. 

I haven’t liked Eleven since the first season and that painful ass punk arc that went no where and her weird “I have friends but these popular people not liking me means I have no friends” arc was just stupid. 

I actually loved the build up before the second part of last season but it kind of built up to a pretty big let down. Not sure why TV writers have this issue with injecting relationship drama into everything. People can be good friends without needing to date. 

Reminds me of how when Game of Thrones ran out of source material suddenly a bunch of relationship drama was added anywhere they could put it."
H2O: Just Add Water,What they did with Eddie was inexcusable! I’ll never forgive them lol
H2O: Just Add Water,Sex Education could take a few notes from that.
H2O: Just Add Water,Carol Burnett will be joining.
H2O: Just Add Water,Trying? Is the script resisting them by randomly appearing new characters they didn't write?
H2O: Just Add Water,Kill Mike
H2O: Just Add Water,Even though added character this season arguably the best.
H2O: Just Add Water,All the new characters are dead.
H2O: Just Add Water,Yes please
H2O: Just Add Water,We’ll RIP Steve it’s the final season we all know they were waiting to do it until the end already building to it last season but I’d rather johnathan die
H2O: Just Add Water,"Can Mike please die in the first minutes of the first episode then?

So we can actually focus on the likable cast."
H2O: Just Add Water,I hope for once they have the balls to kill off a main cast member
H2O: Just Add Water,"So they are not going to introduce Robins mam? I would really love it if they cast her actual mam (Uma Therman) to play that part, it just makes sense also very easy casting too.

I'm sure the audience would definitely be okay with it as well."
H2O: Just Add Water,Good.  There are too many as it is.
H2O: Just Add Water,Keyword - “trying”.
H2O: Just Add Water,"People complain about the ballooning cast, but also every time they add new characters, (most of them) are the most popular of the season. They should do whatever they want."
H2O: Just Add Water,Original cast?  They have a lotta people to kill then.
H2O: Just Add Water,I've never really liked Jonathan so I had no issues at all with how they handled him in S4. Eddie was a way more interesting and fun character.
H2O: Just Add Water,"They know their jig is up. The audience is on to the “add a character to kill later in season” gimmick. Any new face we see we will immediately assume that person will perish. And it being th last season, its too late to add a persistent character."
H2O: Just Add Water,But adding Billy and Eddie was what kept show interesting. Anyways - it's gonna be all over soon.
H2O: Just Add Water,A show about will Byers? Urgh. It'll never work.
H2O: Just Add Water,How the hell would new kids even be introduced? A new family comes to live in an inferno?
H2O: Just Add Water,At this point I trust them to make the right decisions. IMO there hasn't been a character that's truly taken away from the show yet (though I wasn't a huge fan of Paul Reiser's acting in Season 4).
H2O: Just Add Water,"Page 1 - Ext.
Eddie returns!

FUCK! Okay okay just this once? Just this once."
H2O: Just Add Water,I still think this show will end as it began. Will and Co playing their first game of DND and basically resetting the “timeline” with El sacrificing herself
H2O: Just Add Water,But then who will they kill
H2O: Just Add Water,I hope there is a few Eddie cameos in form of flashbacks or something… what a fantastic character.
H2O: Just Add Water,"Good. S4 was great but it suffered from having way too much characters and too much storylines. Hopefully s5 is a little bit more linear, like s1"
H2O: Just Add Water,"No matter what they write, it won’t be as good as season 1.  The story involving the main characters should have ended there."
H2O: Just Add Water,No point in introducing side characters just to kill them off and keep the main cast alive.
H2O: Just Add Water,Bring back Barb!
H2O: Just Add Water,"i predict that eleven will reach her hand out at the generic evil monster, and fall to her knees in slow motion"
H2O: Just Add Water,This show has been awful since season one. It should have been a one and done thing.
H2O: Just Add Water,The pizza guy was the worst. Am I wrong in thinking that his whole existence was just so that eleven had a tub to soak in for the finale?
H2O: Just Add Water,The show is shit anyway.
H2O: Just Add Water,THey should remove some from original cast instead.
H2O: Just Add Water,Barb
H2O: Just Add Water,"let’s just focus on the final season. get this crap over with already. it’s already spawned endless 80s inspired schlock i’m sick of it … completely… well not “un” i guess, more so over inspired"
H2O: Just Add Water,They’re gonna do hopper like they did Bob
H2O: Just Add Water,Hopefully they can tighten up the writing so that military grade walkie-talkies aren’t required..
H2O: Just Add Water,No don’t see how you have an entire town go through that and not explore at least a couple new characters.
H2O: Just Add Water,"It's not hard to not add new characters... just don't add new characters. It's not like these people came out of nowhere, you created and wrote them in lol"
H2O: Just Add Water,"Last season, last movie or last episode is a good time to kill off major characters. Not gonna post any examples."
H2O: Just Add Water,Kill Steve.
H2O: Just Add Water,Please eliminate pizza delivery dude.
H2O: Just Add Water,"The Duffer Brothers are absolute masters at this. While I'd totally trust them to introduce new main characters,  I also understand their instinct to close with the originals.

I cannot wait."
H2O: Just Add Water,They need to commit to killing people. Eleven is right the duffers are soft as fluffers.
H2O: Just Add Water,"I don’t know, if they don’t add new characters we won’t get characters like Susie or Eddy…"
H2O: Just Add Water,"I don't see the problem. I enjoyed all the new  characters in s4, they were fleshed out really well."
H2O: Just Add Water,"They already dug a hole too deep. The fact of the matter is that there should’ve never been a fifth season even planned for Stranger Things. Yes it’s a great show, yes it is pretty influential in today’s world but we need to let go at some point. As the actors who play these characters grow older, it starts to make less sense and in a way they loose a lot of their acting ability with age (though it’s usually the inverse). The kids in the show did amazing in the first three season (not to say they were particularly bad in the fourth) because they didn’t need to *act* like kids, they were kids. As Gaten reached 20, it’s harder for him to act like a Junior, let alone Sophmore in high-school. 

The Duffer Bros also messed it all up by setting up the end-of-season cliffhanger in the way they did. The scene which hangs over the entirety of Hawkins, in anticipation for the next season, disallows any time jump to make the kids ageing more natural. I know I’ve said it before but a fifth season was so unnecessary and now they find themselves forcing a new story upon the viewer."
H2O: Just Add Water,"I just hope robin and will survive. Killing off the queer characters is gonna sting way too much. Steve has been on borrowed time for awhile, I really thought he was gonna bite the dust with the bats."
H2O: Just Add Water,Final season?  Thank god.
H2O: Just Add Water,They’re only doing it because Millie Bobbie Brown bitched about too many new characters ruining her photo ops. Guess she doesn’t like to share the spotlight.
H2O: Just Add Water,"LOL, swear to God before I checked the actual link I thought this was an Onion Entertainment headline. 

But no, it's actual news that these guys can't hold focus on their already existing characters. 

>We’re doing our best to resist \[adding new characters\] for Season 5. We’re trying not to do that so we can focus on the OG characters, I guess.

""I mean, if we have to like, do things with the OGs, *I GUESS*, sure, okay, whatever (vigorous shrugging ensues)"" LOL"
H2O: Just Add Water,"Do or do not, there is no try."
H2O: Just Add Water,Max is not OG Cast. Came later. Didn’t understand how her role became so big.
H2O: Just Add Water,[deleted]
H2O: Just Add Water,I just hope Stranger Things continues with a different cast and different Adventure
H2O: Just Add Water,For some reason the entire time I thought season 5 was the last season. Even telling my gf don’t worry you don’t have to watch any more after this….oops. 😂
H2O: Just Add Water,"I wouldn't be surprised if both Steve and Will dies in S5. Will sacrificing himself to save Mike, and Steve sacrificing himself to save Nancy. It'd make sense from a story perspective."
H2O: Just Add Water,They need to focus on not having very episode the length of a movie.
H2O: Just Add Water,I thought it was over already. Too much of good thing. Can’t wait to see these kinds still reprising the roles for the next 30 years.
H2O: Just Add Water,“Trying”  rofl
H2O: Just Add Water,"Please keep trying. Right now the main character count clocks in at about 20 (!!!), and they're all lovable. Just let them have their stories told."
H2O: Just Add Water,Had no idea the next season was the last?
H2O: Just Add Water,Killing off Eddie was a mistake.
H2O: Just Add Water,"They might as well, pretty much lost me after the first season, I’m still struggling through though cause people keep saying “it gets really good if you keep watching”"
H2O: Just Add Water,I’ll never forget Eddie. Most relatable character in the show.
H2O: Just Add Water,Except every time they do they are somehow better than the og
H2O: Just Add Water,"Season 5 begins:

Grogu was just a regular high school kid, never seen any weird shit in his 55 years of life.  He’s small, lovable, and totally not about to rip the rug from under you with senseless self-sacrifice."
H2O: Just Add Water," Well, a possible love interest for Steve would be cool…."
H2O: Just Add Water,"""But theres not enough gender queer poc minorities"" 🗿"
H2O: Just Add Water,Hmmm the Duffer bros said they had planned all 5 seasons out ahead of time so why would this even be a thing. That’s rather strange…
H2O: Just Add Water,Eh…gonna get roasted here but I’ll do it anyway.  Can’t we have like a Menudo clause where when they age out of being cute preteens we re-cast them all?
H2O: Just Add Water,they should focus on writing a better show
H2O: Just Add Water,Please bring back Eddie as a vampire. Thank you
H2O: Just Add Water,I’m confused. I thought the series and ended with last season they put out.
H2O: Just Add Water,Not diverse enough . Need new characters
H2O: Just Add Water,"Learning all the wrong lessons, new characters are fine they just should get 1/8 of the treatment Billy got after a superweak season two"
H2O: Just Add Water,Gotta be the ugliest cast in tv history
H2O: Just Add Water,"Getting this off my chest…I hate Max.  I thought the addition of her character was awful.  I generally don’t like new additions, but I did like Maya Hawke.  

(I didn’t watch third season…but from what I hear Eddie was a rad dude)"
H2O: Just Add Water,Enough with the new characters.
H2O: Just Add Water,"What ever happened to the outcasts eleven hung out with in that one odd season 2? episode?

Did they have any intention of using those characters anymore at some point?"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Although this post is 8 years old, if anyone else reads this, both the animation and story get progressively better each season.

There are two or three relatively bad or ""cringy"" episodes in the first few seasons (watch out for the IMDB rating), but overall it's really good. 

Also the ending is more emotional than it has any right to be for a show, in theory, aimed at kids."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Did Sonic Boom start strong or something?
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Someone in DreamWorks look on the other room where they were creating dragons: race to the edge and said""we will do funny copy of this "" some story lines started as greate ideas but (incompetent) writer  turn them in to the unfunny jokes  

(both shows are Pg +7 ) 
(Both premier in 2015)"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Eight years later I agree.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Many storylines where great ideas but writers decide to make ""funny "" jokes"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I came up on Sonic the Hedgehog. It was tight. It should have ended there. Sonic Boom is a pile of garbage. Even my nieces and nephews can't stand that shit. And they can't stand Adventures of Puss in Boots either.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Haha, a blast from the past then. Crazy to think I've also been on this site for nearly a decade...

Just finished the last season and was pleasantly surprised and am still a bit moved."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,So I checked this out and it is ridiculously low-budget. It's not very good either.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I would give anything for this.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Please god
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,yes please
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I would be all in
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Yes! Do it! :-)
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I live for this show.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,And Billy Drago :(
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Same
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Just don’t have it on Starz
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Same!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,You don't know Jack
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Sho Nuff!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,You love to hear it
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Fred Fredburger was a name known by every kid at my middle school.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Hoss Delgado is my homeboy
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,DESTROY US ALL!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Clowns hate tangelos
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,One of Cartoon Network’s best and a true shame the whole series isn’t on DVD.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Scrape and lick.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"""Hateful fart cartoon"" is going to be one of my favorite descriptions of anything, ever."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"[They caused Property Damage, Like an Angry Woman](https://youtu.be/5vA5c5-7d-w)"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Please pass the egg salad.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Loved billy’s relationship with his adopted spider son
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [“Why won’t you love me dad?! I’ll be anything you want me to be!”](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Loved it
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Definitely a favorite of mine
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"I still, to this day, reference the root beer fountain episode.

""Un*LIMITED* access, *to the fountain*"""
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Yes.
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,F R E D B U R G E R
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,Juuudge? Can I have some nachos?
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,I think he's earned a free hotdog
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"""The name's Hoss. Hoss *(muscle flex)* Del-*(muscle flex)*-ga-*(muscle flex)*-do"
The Adventures of Puss in Boots,"No joke, we literally just finished that episode and then I saw this comment."
All Hail King Julien,The one on netflix?  Haven't seen it but I like to move it.
All Hail King Julien,"Yeah, I watched and enjoyed it. I enjoyed Mitch Watson's previous shows (Scooby Doo: Mystery Inc. and Beware the Batman) and watched it. I'm not a huge fan of Madagascar, but I liked the show's weird humor and satire on politics and trends. Plus, I really liked the adventurous tone it took with Exiled. "
All Hail King Julien,I’ve watched all 5 seasons.
All Hail King Julien,"If you like adult humour dressed up in kids TV, this is the show for you, my friend. "
All Hail King Julien,"I've heard, and its nothing special"
All Hail King Julien,This post brought to you by the makers of All Hail King Julien.
All Hail King Julien,"Steve

-4 when fighting Highschool Kids

+8 when fighting Interdemensional Demons"
All Hail King Julien,The Dustin/Steve pairing was amazing. Steve ended being one of the best characters on the show by far.
All Hail King Julien,Does anyone else see that Dustin is the only one in the pack that doesn’t have a brother or sister? He also doesn’t seem to have a Dad around so to me Steve seems to be his only older guy figure and I think that’s amazing.
All Hail King Julien,#justiceforbob
All Hail King Julien,"I think Nancy and Steve grown a lot with the story, and a part for the better. Steve had the most growth after getting beat up in the first season, he realized that wasn't him. Anyways, I just hated how the kids would square up with those damn dema-dogs but when Steves was getting the crap beat out of him they were just standing there yelling. "
All Hail King Julien,"The pairings of Dustin/Steve and Eleven/Hopper was the two best things about this season. 

Honorable mention to the scene between Billy and Mrs Wheeler."
All Hail King Julien,"""Like the Germans?""

Steve and Dustin were comedy gold!"
All Hail King Julien,At the beginning of the series I always thought Nancy was too good for Steve. I was wrong. Steve is too good for Nancy.
All Hail King Julien,"Never have I hated a character so much in the beginning of a show, only to be rooting like crazy everytime he fucking steps up.

Honestly I sort of forgot about Steve in between seasons, and when I saw him in season 2 my first reaction was ""Oh yeah, fuck this guy."" Then a few episodes later I'm like, ""Oh yeah, this mother fucker Steve."""
All Hail King Julien,He arguably has the best character arc on the entire show
All Hail King Julien,He broke the camera because Jonathan took nudes photos of his girlfriend. Does nobody remember this?
All Hail King Julien,I just wish they would have allowed him to beat the shit out of Billy...hated every second of Billy I saw.
All Hail King Julien,I demand a drake and josh style spinoff sitcom where dustin and steve become unlikely step brothers
All Hail King Julien,"Dustin and Steve were the best of the show, but the best scene between Dustin and Mike's dad was comedy gold, I never laughed so hard."
All Hail King Julien,"Steve's arc is one of the best ""jerk"" arcs ever on TV. Him and Jamie Lannister. Love it. "
All Hail King Julien,"I'm actually really wondering about Steve's character for S3. He's no longer dating Nancy, He's not going to be hanging out with the kids or the adults on a regular basis.

He has nothing that grounds him to the town of hawkings anymore. His family was never introduced, He has no siblings, no friends. 

Had Dustin not met him by happenstance he wouldn't have even been apart of this adventure. "
All Hail King Julien,"Long live the king, and may Nancy forever live in regret!!"
All Hail King Julien,"I need to watch season 1 again because I remember not liking Steve but this season I was all about him. Even at the beginning when Nancy was drunk over Barb and he was just wondering if she loved him. He was even super sweet and asked Jonathan to take Nancy home.


Steve....even when in an argument with his girlfriend is still man enough to trust the guy who has a crush on his GF to get her home safely. "
All Hail King Julien,My 2 favorite relationships are hopper and eleven and dustin and steve hes the unexpected big brother and im glad he took dustin under his wing it shows he just needed a friend thats decent
All Hail King Julien,"Too bloody right !
Sod, the kids, Steve was like an epic RPG NPC that helps you out and levels the playing field.

What a guy.

What hair !"
All Hail King Julien,King Steve grew old and became Steven King 
All Hail King Julien,"The whole season I expected a reveal that Billy is gay. Was it just me seeing things, or were there hints?"
All Hail King Julien,Best character arc of the show. My bet is it keeps arcing. 
All Hail King Julien,I hope Keery is seriously considered for an Emmy nom.
All Hail King Julien,[deleted]
All Hail King Julien,I can deal with him being the meme this season since he's an actual character 
All Hail King Julien,"Am I alone in thinking Steve was not really being a dick by breaking Jonothan’s camera? He legitimately took pictures of Nancy naked, through a window. He should have gotten reported, not just a broken camera. "
All Hail King Julien,[deleted]
All Hail King Julien,Is joe any good in this show? Last time I saw him perform was in some plays back in our high school and he always seemed like he’d be going somewhere great
All Hail King Julien,"The real MVP is Bob, you will forever be missed R.I.P"
All Hail King Julien,LUCAS is the REAL winner this season 2
All Hail King Julien,sticking with the RPG references in the show Steve is definitely the tank. He's not officially part of the kids' party but he's definitely the tank anytime he's involved.
All Hail King Julien,"Steve had a really nice character growth towards the end of s1 that it made me so mad that the show redeem Steve for me by not running. I liked that he didn't lose that in the second season and he seemed to have grown into a better person. But that was not cool leaving Nancy drunk at the party. 

Nancy and Jonathan story line was too focus on on justice for barb and just cementing their relationship. Cute and nice, but didn't add to much in their character growth. Although I do love seeing Nancy take charge and have the more ""masculine"" role while Jonathan has the more ""feminine"" role. "
All Hail King Julien,He's the best character in season 2.  It's not even close. 
All Hail King Julien,"I really hate the line ""We all like Steve, but we don't love Steve"".

Steve got the best character development in Season One.

1. He started out to look like a Jock-Asshole.
2. He realised his errors and made the best of it.
3. He confronted his asshole ""friends"".
4. He stood up to the challenge and actually rescued both Nancy and Jonathan.
5. He was literally ""there"" for Nancy.
6. In Season 2, he was actually protecting Nancy from being killed, from her own early to expose the truth. Nancy was lucky that ""the agency"" had a change of management. If it was still run by Dr. Brenner, she and Jonathan would be dead.
7. He could have just GTFO, the moment those kids were going on one of their ""adventures"".

I really hope in Season 3 that Steve and Nancy gets back together and Jonathan will be with Samantha.

I really hope this show will not go the ""Gay"" route and make Steve ""go gay"" with the Max's step-brother. They are strongly implying Max's brother is or might be gay, but I really hope that they will not make Steve ""gay""."
All Hail King Julien,#justiceformews
All Hail King Julien,He's second behind Will for me in best expanded character this season.
All Hail King Julien,bruh did this fucking ad just spoil the show. wtf
All Hail King Julien,[deleted]
All Hail King Julien,justice for mew mew
All Hail King Julien,Steve is such a good dude. Shame about him and Nancy. 
All Hail King Julien,"I have to agree. Steve's journey has been really great. Every time you think he is going in a stereotypical direction, he changes course and surprises you. That ending with him and Dustin was downright heartwarming. "
All Hail King Julien,"He needs to train so he doesn't get his arse kicked again in the third season, or it could be joke. ""You got your arse kicked again?""."
All Hail King Julien,"I liked *Stranger Things*. I did not like *Stranger Things 2*. That being said, maybe I could watch it again at a more leisurely pace & enjoy it more, but some of it was dreadful... that Suicide Squad episode was especially awful. "
All Hail King Julien,Didn't really like him in season1 but in 2 he turned into one of my favorite character 
All Hail King Julien,I've never seen a heel turn face like Steve.  
All Hail King Julien,"Every time Steve gets punched in the face, he becomes a better, stronger person."
All Hail King Julien,Someone really needs to teach him how to fight though. That's twice he's gotten his ass kicked.
All Hail King Julien,Maybe Kali can be Steve's rebound.
All Hail King Julien,King Steve or Stephen King?
All Hail King Julien,I feel like this is a spoiler right? 
All Hail King Julien,"God fucking dammit, if the title is a spoiler I'm going to be so mad."
All Hail King Julien,I’m obsessed with everything about this show. From the 80s nostalgia to the characters. I can’t get over it and I already binged watched :(
All Hail King Julien,"During the first season I was very much doubtful about Steve, but during season two he became one of my favorite characters"
All Hail King Julien,I really love Steve's character but I can't get to invested in him because I feel like they are building him up to die in the series. That would be too much. 
All Hail King Julien,"I was sure he was dead...so glad he wasn't. 
Billy totally kicked his ass though."
All Hail King Julien,When the hell did Steve become my favorite character? He’s awesome! I must be in the Upside Down. 
All Hail King Julien,I was a big fan of Goth Eleven and Hoppers reaction to that.
All Hail King Julien,"Every time he had a scene I was genuinely excited for what he was going to do, he is such a badass with a good heart"
All Hail King Julien,His hair style in season 2 reminded me of Jean Ralphio.
All Hail King Julien,"At the end of season 1, my wife and I dubbed him “Good Guy Steve” It’s been really Fun to watch his character grow and change into the hero Hawkins deserves. "
All Hail King Julien,Yes!! Steve was my MVP last season and this season he just did it again! Loved Dustin and him together.
All Hail King Julien,"I love the transition from Season 1 Steve to Season 2 Steve. I didnt get the ""Nancys Special"" thing, but you can tell he changed because of her by the end. His transition was perfectly executed. Also the contrast of him and Maxs brother was awesome."
All Hail King Julien,The scene in the tunnel when Steve and Dustin are getting charged had me emotionally up against the wall by the throat!!
All Hail King Julien,This show makes me feel like a kid again. Best feeling ever
All Hail King Julien,"All hail King Steve and the Royal Consort, a can of Farrah Fawcett spray!"
All Hail King Julien,Steve is a BAMF who gets things DONE
All Hail King Julien,Dustin and Steve ended up being to each other the sibling they never had 
All Hail King Julien,"I was two episodes from finishing when I saw this headline, and I was convinced it meant that Steve was going to die. I was biting my nails for 2 hours."
All Hail King Julien,"Yeah, they nailed it.  I hated him in the first season, towards the end was warming. 

Second you get to see that he is a guy who will step up, and is loyal, maybe overly trusting but brave. 

Fucking great show."
All Hail King Julien,He's a lot better than that asshole Billy! 
All Hail King Julien,"If any lotr actor they had to cast, the show should have gone with Sean Bean instead of Sean Astin. Then it would be more fitting to kill the poor Bob."
All Hail King Julien,How about a fucking spoiler tag?! Fuck
All Hail King Julien,Can't wait to see the bad bitch Steve upgrades to next season.
All Hail King Julien,"""Yeah yeah, don't cream yourself""

Edit: Downvoted for a Steve quote?"
All Hail King Julien,"I liked Steve this season, but I can't forget the awful things he said to Jonathan in season 1. Every time I felt myself starting to like him, my mind just went back to how sad that scene was and how it made me feel about the character."
All Hail King Julien,"Anyone else find Eleven to be the show's weak link? Something about how she is written just irritates me.

Great season overall though."
All Hail King Julien,"Best character in the show, by far. I was so bummed out for him at the beginning of Season 2 - he didn't deserve what Nancy did to him (that bitch!). "
All Hail King Julien,This headline is such a fucking spoiler.

All Hail King Julien,Literally the only good part of season 2
All Hail King Julien,"Not if the sniffer dogs get at his handbag, he won't."
All Hail King Julien,God this show sucks

All Hail King Julien,"Your title eludes to him dying a glorious death. Nice spoiler(maybe), asshole(maybe). "

Sam and Cat,"> “It was a show about a woman who was finding herself sexually, turned into a show about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.” 

😬"
Sam and Cat,">Casting K-pop superstar Jennie of Blackpink was the biggest get for Levinson. Under the show’s hashtag and teaser trailers, her stans steamrolled comment sections to cheer on the singer in her first acting role. But crew members claim Jennie has barely any air time and an inconsequential story arc. “It was like three or four lines per episode for her,” a production source says. “They didn’t let her talk that much. Her job was to sit there [and] look pretty, basically.” 

Like YG Entertainment would have agreed to anything more. They now have a well-established reputation for overhyping and underdelivering."
Sam and Cat,Sam Levinson seriously needs to jerk off before coming into work.
Sam and Cat,">The first public inkling of trouble came last April, when director Amy Seimetz, of The Girlfriend Experience and She Dies Tomorrow, suddenly exited with roughly 80 percent of the six-episode series finished. HBO addressed the news by confirming The Idol was set to have a major creative overhaul and would be adjusting the cast and crew. There was little explanation for the shakeup, except for reports that Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

&#x200B;

I mean, the protagonist is a woman, how is leading too much into a female perspective is bad?"
Sam and Cat,"I understand that Levinson is a fucking creep, but let’s not forget that The Weeknd is co-creator, co-writer, exec. producer, and apparently put in the request that turned the show on its head. Whatever comes of this, he deserves just as much blame as anyone else, and it’s crazy that most people are kinda glossing over that."
Sam and Cat,It’s insane that Euphoria will coast over 100 million for the next season.
Sam and Cat,"Man, I was mostly interested in this show just for Amy Seimetz. Replacing her killed my interest even before all that shitshow."
Sam and Cat,Every single thing I read about Sam Levinson screams *”I’M THE SON OF A FAMOUS DIRECTOR SO I THINK I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!”*
Sam and Cat,I seem to recall that the original director had wanted episodes exploring Lily rose depp’s character’s personal life and relationship with a childhood friend- good reflective stuff that gives the show depth. Anyway The Weeknd vetoed it for being too feminist 💀
Sam and Cat,"> Levinson allegedly stopped sending scripts to HBO and certain department heads, according to two people familiar with the matter. “I got the vibe that the mood on set was, ‘What’s HBO gonna do, pull the plug? Yeah, right. If they want a third season of Euphoria, they’ll give me what I want… We’re just gonna shoot what we want and if [HBO execs] have a problem with it, that’s their problem,’” they explain. 

wouldn't be surprised if Euphoria gets canned after this, the arrogance is astonishing"
Sam and Cat,"*Seimetz seemed set up to fail from the start. When she arrived on set seven weeks before the show started filming, she was given half-finished scripts, a first-time showrunner in Epstein, a tight schedule, and near-impossible expectations from HBO, those sources say. “Amy was doing her best in an impossible situation, but she was going to lose this no matter what,” one production member says. “Honestly, I think HBO handed her a shit stack.” (Seimetz declined to comment.)  HBO had wanted to keep costs low with a series budget around $54 million...Euphoria’s upcoming third season, which is expected to cost at least $110 million.*

So they wanted to do it cheaply, didn't make sure the script was done, drove the director out of the project before it was done, reshot the whole thing writing it in a completely different way...  It's sounds like the developmental execs at HBO are terrified to do their job well given all the projects getting axed by the new overlords."
Sam and Cat,I went from wow that sounds like a mess to work on to wow an egg where and she is begging him for what?!?! I like dark shows and shows that push the envelope but this is not it.
Sam and Cat,I know several people worked on this show and I’ve yet to hear a single person say a good thing about it. Such a fucking mess and it definitely crossed into dangerous territory once Levinson was there.
Sam and Cat,They gave The Weeknd too much power and not surprisingly he went on an ego trip. He has that movie with Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan that he's also writing and producing up next which is too bad because we'll probably hear something similar there.
Sam and Cat,"I'm genuinely starting to believe that this show does not and never will actually exist, and that its seemingly neverending promotional rollout/behind-the-scenes soap opera is in itself a work of Andy Kaufmanesque performance art. Certainly I'm no closer to knowing - beyond the bare-bones outline - what the hell the actual story is supposed to be than I was when it was first announced approximately two thousand years ago, so maybe it really is all just an elaborate Situationist prank?

At any rate, I think it's very funny that everyone's wringing their hands about an obviously planted story that paints the show as a dark, dangerous, boundary-smashing orgy of decadence, which just so happens to be the exact image its makers are going for. [This legendary Onion story](https://www.theonion.com/marilyn-manson-now-going-door-to-door-trying-to-shock-p-1819565904) kept springing to mind."
Sam and Cat,All of Sam Levinson’s projects seem like a dumpster fire to work on. His sets are always chaotic and messy and unorganized. And this torture porn thing is not a good look.
Sam and Cat,"""Falling too much into a female perspective [paraphrased]”

On, my dear God, *no*!  Not something that will speak to 51% of the human population!!  The *horror*!

JFC."
Sam and Cat,ok but that egg scene? have you lost your damn mind levinson?
Sam and Cat,"Levinson sounds like a budding Weinstein. Dude's private, sketchy predilections coming out publicly, and all he gets is more money and power. 

When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time, Hollywood."
Sam and Cat,I'm not going to be surprised at all if some kind of Kevin Spacey/Bryan Singer/Harvey Weinstein type stories come out about Sam Levinson. I am surprised they haven't come out yet.
Sam and Cat,Sam Levinson’s got some issues.
Sam and Cat,"Warning: Rape, Sexual Assault

“At various points, Levinson’s scripts contained disturbing sexual and physically violent scenes between Depp and Tesfaye’s characters, three sources familiar with the matter claim. In one draft episode, there allegedly was a scene where Tesfaye bashes in Depp’s face, and her character smiles and asks to be beaten more, giving Tesfaye an erection. (This scene was never shot, the source says.) Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.) “

Can someone check Levinson’s and The Weeknd’s hard drive and search history please. I know that these ended up not getting filmed but why were they up for consideration in the first place?"
Sam and Cat,"Even since it was revealed that The Weeknd felt that the show was heading too much into a ""female perspective"" and therefore decided to change that I knew the show would end up being messy."
Sam and Cat,This will either bomb or this will be such a huge hit that talking heads will question if this is the further moral decline and decadence of society.
Sam and Cat,The Weekend is a misogynist? How unsurprising.
Sam and Cat,Wish Harmony Korine was at the helm 😀
Sam and Cat,Well I'm glad I'm not the only person who thinks Euphoria is creepy voyeurism and not the show of a generation anymore
Sam and Cat,"Reading the whole article, it appear that as problematic as Sam's writing is, the issues were apparent long before he took over.

Looking at some of these quotes in bold:

**As promising as those initial scripts were, the scripts for the final episodes were still only half-finished and the finale completely unwritten. Seimetz was encouraged by HBO and producers to put her own spin on the show and write the last episode, a source explains. As a result, Seimetz was polishing up scripts and writing while directing. She also had her assistant, who had no previous credited writing experience, writing scenes, with HBO making the assistant a staff writer last January. (The assistant did not respond to a request for comment.)**

**Organization quickly evaporated, mainly due to changes in the script, sources say. One production member says the first version of the show went through more than 20 rewrites, saying scripts were being updated constantly: “We did it every fucking day. It was insane.** 

**Eventually, the crew say they stopped getting one-liners, an industry term for daily schedules of what was being shot. And the few one-liners that were given out quickly became useless due to changes, sources say. Decisions were being made on the fly, frustrating several crew members who say they felt they could never properly prepare for the next day of work. “I’d be driving home [at the end of the day] and they’d be like, ‘Oh, we’re adding a scene, but it hasn’t been written yet,’” one says.** 

**A report from April blamed the show’s overhaul on Tesfaye, who was reportedly unhappy that the story was focusing too much on Depp’s character, according to Deadline. A source with knowledge seconds that Tesfaye was the reason behind the shakeup, wanting to tone down the cult aspect of the storyline and pivot into something else entirely, dropping the “feminist lens” through which the show was being told as a result. “It was like the Weeknd wanted one show that was all about him — Sam was on board with that,” another source explains to Rolling Stone.**


In a six episode season, if you still have unfinished scripts for the remaining episodes and an unwritten final episode while you are filming an hectic production, it is obvious that the problem are deeper than just one person.


From reading the quotes above, It look like nobody had any actual finished outline of what direction the show was going toward or how it would end since they admitted that they already have gone through 20 rewrites while Seimetz was still in charge of the show. 

When you are rewriting scripts that many times and you still haven't even finished the scripts for the remaining episodes in a six episode season, it will be difficult to have a coherent story and character development. 

The crazy thing is that if this was a 22 episode season, it would make sense to have rewrite or revision to the scripts due to the length of the season but when you are struggling to write up only six episodes with a small timeframe for shooting and production, this is basically an issue from HBO management to the writing team. 

As problematic and disturbing as the reports have been about Sam especially backstage on Euphoria, it appear that just blaming him is the easy way out regarding the issues plaguing this show. 

The article make it clear that the issues were there from the first day of production before he was even involved and that the issues just kept getting worse as shooting continued. 

Also, It look like Tesfaye wanted the show to be more about him and his character compared to Depp's character. When you have one of the two Main Character of the show apparently having an issue with a woman character being the focus, you are going to have a difficult time appeasing him unless you recast him with a new actor who would be fine with allowing a woman to shine.

Honestly, you can just lay the blame on HBO management which appear to have an unrealistic deadline and a refusal to oversee what actually is going on regarding the scripts and production."
Sam and Cat,Kpop fans will make or break this show.
Sam and Cat,[removed]
Sam and Cat,"Slightly off topic but does anyone else share this opinion about The Weeknd:

He sings about all the drugs and sex he does but form the very beginning I was like “nah,  I don’t believe you.”  He’s trying too hard. Like that kid that brags about his hot girlfriend but you don’t know her cause she goes to another school. He’s always giving lil dick energy. Some artists can pull it off, the attitude, the machismo, but not him. He’s a dork to his core. A pretender. 

Solid pop music though. Can’t argue with his phenomenal success!"
Sam and Cat,I mean Euphoria was softcore porn with the appeal of teenagers pretending they invented fucking wasn't it?
Sam and Cat,I always found the critics absolute obsession and love for this show odd. The length to which they show drugs and sex not only feels weird to watch it’s also just not accurate. Then again maybe most of the critics hadn’t experienced high school in some time so they actually thought this was accurate.
Sam and Cat,Honestly I stopped watching euphoria after a season because it just made me feel yucky.
Sam and Cat,"Tbh, you could also make a fine argument about euphoria glamorizing drugs and debauchery, more than actually addressing its problems. Just watch the first few minutes of the very first episode and you'll understand,lol"
Sam and Cat,Same with Euphoria.  It’s porn.   You can tell his intended audience is one that enjoys sec versions of saw.
Sam and Cat,"His Netflix film, Malcom and Marie was utter garbage in my opinion. I enjoyed Euphoria but when I look back on why I enjoyed it nothing comes to mind. I tried rewatching it with my girlfriend and found it to be more annoying than thought provoking or even entertaining."
Sam and Cat,"Justice for Amy Steimetz, an actually talented director with a VIEW and not just sensationalist style over substance.

This could have been so good with her given how terrific The Girlfriend Experience was."
Sam and Cat,[deleted]
Sam and Cat,The joys of Hollywood nepotism. Does Sam even know what real life is like?
Sam and Cat,"Used to date his former nanny. She’s also a total sociopath, and I’m not surprised she found herself in his employ. Hope this is the end of his gross and weird almost-middle-aged-man-cum-teen-sex-fantasizer trip."
Sam and Cat,"You can tell this show is going to be fucking sick, not in a good way. Euphoria works because it’s a more modern day “skins” but with all this stuff coming out about this guy his shows and its intentions are starting to show themselves"
Sam and Cat,"Zendayas story arch aside, Euphoria is just Degrassi with penises."
Sam and Cat,This is pretty obviously some marketing hype disguised as an expose.
Sam and Cat,What an awkward headline
Sam and Cat,This is giving Marlon Brando/Bernando Bertolucci vibes (IYKYK)...
Sam and Cat,"Sam do be into depraved, toxic sexuality."
Sam and Cat,"on the fence about whether this is *intentional* marketing -- but given that this exact article has been posted on Reddit 11 separate times, has almost 1500 comments on this thread alone, Tesfaye had a targeted and ready-made clip to respond to Rolling Stone with, and it subsumed discourse all day yesterday on other social media platforms incl. Twitter, I'm pretty sure it generated exactly the kind of outrage/buzz that will propel the premiere to sky-high viewership. Happy to revisit this comment when the show premieres and eat my words if I'm wrong but I doubt I will be. It's worth noting that the loudest critics of Euphoria have usually watched 16 episodes, maybe even all 18.

I'm pretty disturbed at how comfortable everyone is casually slinging around rumors about Levinson being some kind of predator, though. Not only is there zero evidence of that, but there's not even any *allegations* of him being remotely creepy. There's not even anything to disprove, just people clearly hoping that bad things will come out about him presumably because they dislike his work so much. Levinson certainly doesn't seem to find his own work as titillating as everyone here clearly does -- [seriously, I'd recommend reading this THR interview with him, he comes off as very thoughtful and just...not creepy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/euphoria-creator-boundary-pushing-hbo-drama-didnt-pull-punches-1218588/) -- and nearly all the social media comments are bursting with inter-generational hysteria about Kids These Days and dismissing Euphoria as porn while clearly ignoring the fact that Euphoria is making a commentary on how the ubiquity of internet porn has affected culture and particularly teenagers. I respect it for at least trying to start a cultural conversation on how porn is affecting youth and sexual expectations/gender dynamics especially when a lot of the takes around porn are just like, ""why don't you just jerk off in the privacy of your own room, you sick freak, and we can all pretend this huge cultural force doesn't exist.""

All this is not to discount the worrying accusations in the article, such as that of a disorganized set -- poor work conditions are no joke -- but all of the other stuff like the description of the egg scene, which wasn't even filmed, is to some extent clearly being enjoyed as salacious and transgressive by those who read it. Rape kinks are real and [not uncommon](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19085605/), another thing that could stand to be critically engaged with instead of acting like it's some collective dirty secret. Maybe the show failed at that but we can't really say until watching, which I'm sure most people will -- but I'm fascinated by how many people will eat up Levinson's work and then will completely miss the commentary or continue to insist he's some pervert. This conflict between what people do/want and what they openly admit to doing and wanting is a running theme throughout his prior work....and if you don't believe me on that then read the THR interview. anyway, ready to get downvoted into oblivion lol"
Sam and Cat,"Why do people keep hiring Lily-Rose Depp?

How much is this costing her dad in influence and cash?"
Sam and Cat,Gonna be funny watching everyone slowly realize Sam Levinson is a total hack…
Sam and Cat,Idk something tells me we will one day be talking about Sam Levinson the way we talk about J*ss Wh*d*n
Sam and Cat,"This: 
>	Tesfaye, who is co-creator, felt the show was heading too much into a “female perspective.”

Plus this:
>	It was like any rape fantasy that any toxic man would have in the show — and then the woman comes back for more because it makes her music better,”

Is super disconcerting."
Sam and Cat,"I’m not a huge Euphoria fan, and I tend to agree that Zendaya’s arc is definitely the best (and maybe the only good) storyline, but I’m always a bit confused by Reddit’s disgust for the show. 

It’s definitely not a super realistic depiction of high school and it’s way over dramatized, but people do drugs and have sex in high school. I went to a tiny school and even there we had heroin addicts, meth addicts, etc. People had sex at parties. It was certainly way more awkward and not as glamorous as it is on Euphoria, but Euphoria is purposefully melodramatic.

The nudity can be too much, but all of the actors are in their mid-twenties. I don’t really agree that it’s pedophilic of the creator to depict high school sex.  All of Harmony Korine’s early movies had  more fucked up stuff involving kids and teens than Euphoria does."
Sam and Cat,Dude is a scumbag. Plain and simple.
Sam and Cat,Read the stuff that got cut and I think I'm going to skip this one.

Oh boy."
Sam and Cat,"Its funny, I work in TV maeketing. Was watching a few trailers of The Idol today for work and said to my co workers “this is just softcore porn”."
Sam and Cat,"I'm so fucking done with overly sexual shows and movies. I just want a good show/movie without having to see extremely graphic sex scenes for way too long or straight up pansexual orgies.

I want to be captivated, not shocked. It has nothing to do with my beliefs (atheist) and I'm not sexually frustrated, I just hate it because of how unnecessary it is. If I wanted to watch porn, the internet's full of it already. It's not art, it's just showing everyone you're a fucking pervert."
Sam and Cat,Sam Levinson is gonna be one of those guys you find out in twenty years was doing some mad creepy shit behind the scenes
Sam and Cat,Euphoria sucked so I’m sure this will too.  At least it looks like the characters are supposed to be adults at least.
Sam and Cat,"The Weeknd deserves as much blame as Levinson imo, dude was a co-producer. Even some of his earlier music references taking advantage of young models, etc. Fucking creeps."
Sam and Cat,More high school teens fuckin... I mean that's HBO's bread and butter
Sam and Cat,I just know Sydney Sweeney is going to expose Sam once *Euphoria* is done. Expecting the upcoming season to be its last tbh.👀
Sam and Cat,"“The Idol, which is being billed as a **darker, crazier, and more risqué** version of Levinson’s smash-hit Euphoria.”

Maybe he hasn't yet, and he legit thinks he's just an artist, but people lie to themselves all the time and often times the harder they try and cover shit up, the more it pokes through. Either way, I'm leaving this here so I can link back to it when it becomes clear I was right."
Sam and Cat,It does suck if hbo enocouraged seimetz to do her own take and bailed on her...But overall I dunno...its the weeknd's show basically.If he wants it changed I guess I don't see the problem.The main creative leads are him and levinson I think(?).

Sam and Cat,Never go full Ryan Murphy.
Sam and Cat,"Wow you mean to tell me that a man who dated Bella Hadid since she was underage and visited all the Covid-unsafe parties in LA is self-centered and egotistical? That’s crazy, I would have never thought."
Sam and Cat,"I'm sure the production of the show has been bad. But this article, to me, seems like it's slanted in a weird way.

The article seems written to imply that something changed from the ""original"" show to ""the current show"" due to the involvement of Levison and The Weeknd. But Levinson and The Weeknd created the show.

I'm failing to understand how the show transforms from A to B when the creators are also the same people leading now. I would understand it if you said it went from A to B to A, but that's not what it says, nor does it say Seimetz rewrote the whole thing. The current version of the show sounds exactly like Levinson and The Weeknd, so how could it have been different in the beginning and why would they have wanted it to be different?"
Sam and Cat,Who exactly is surprised with those two involved?
Sam and Cat,This is such a load gossipy bullshite. How is rolling Stone even in publication still?
Sam and Cat,"""Another proposed scenario was for Depp to carry an egg in her vagina and if she dropped or cracked the egg, Tesfaye’s character would refuse to “rape” her — which sent Depp’s character into a spiral, begging him to “rape” her because she believed he was the key to her success. (This scene also was not filmed because production couldn’t find a way to realistically shoot the scene without having Depp physically insert the egg, another source explains.)""

How hard is it to shoot that? You shoot an angle of hand with egg going between her thighs, you cut to a reaction shot of her face. I mean, we've been simulating actresses being penetrated for decades without actually penetrating them, this cannot be difficult."
Sam and Cat,"What's missing from the story, because it's sourced by anonymous people who clearly wanted to publicize Amy Seimetz's perspective, is The Weeknd's vision of the show. They say it's about a guy's sexually abusive relationship with a woman but missing is his point. 

It could be wish fulfillment smut but there could be  something interesting he's wanting to land on that just wasn't what Amy was interested in doing. 

Messy production and sexual minefields aside, artists can connect with different aspects of a vision and end up running in opposite directions. I loved The Girlfriend Experience and find Amy Seimetz a great director but this may not have been the project for her. Also the Weeknd has never produced a TV series before and relied on Sam Levinson to execute his vision but Levinson was failing everyone

Either way I'll be watching, always down to see a beautiful mess of a series."
Sam and Cat,Nice marketing. When does it air? Sounds interesting.
Sam and Cat,"Unpopular opinion; i can see theWeeknd and Levinsons point of view.  If you want to make a dark and disturbing noir tale about how easy people can be used and abused, you have to show that. Film it. You cant just have have characters say things are bad then turnit in to the triumphs of the independent woman.  Which it sounds like what was happening.  The original director was turning it in to something hopeful and uplifting how the female character perseveres over all obstacles- which is the opposite of the story youre trying to tell"
Sam and Cat,"This comment section is weird. You can tell when people already have their mind made up about something based on what other people have said. It’s just a circle jerk here of people saying basically the same thing.

This is a tv show we are talking about right? They can do whatever they want as long as everyone involved is on board.

We’re getting to this point where sex and nudity in mainstream media has to be tasteful and meaningful and it’s bad if it’s it’s gratuitous. Gratuitous violence is ok though. But at the same time so many people are making a killing on onlyfans servicing that side of what people want. It’s like we’re trying to hide that part of what people are. But at the same time empower people to do whatever the fuck they want. So what if it’s torture porn? Don’t watch it if it sucks. Dude’s out there making what he wants and what some people want to see."

Sam and Cat,The only thing I've learnt from this thread is that reddit absolutely hates sex lmao
Gossip Girl,Yea guessed this was on the chopping block after the creator asked people to tune in. The first season turned a lot of ppl off so even if the new season was better it's a little too late
Gossip Girl,Such a forgettable reboot; gone was the sugary fun energy of the original for a more sophisticatedly dull affair. Not surprised it didn't last long.
Gossip Girl,"I can actually write a full ass dissertation on why this show flopped

It does a lot more telling then showing. One of the girls early on mentioned that they were all best friends since childhood but other than a few minor small interactions, it’s hard to actually believe that they’re friends.

And in the OG the friend group felt believable. Nate and Chuck were childhood best friends, Blair and Serena were friendenemies, Blair and Nate were a couple, Serena and Nate always had a thing for each other, Dan weaseled his way in but then became friends with Chuck, Eric and Nate then got together Blair. 

It tries to hard to be “woke” I hate this term because it’s been scooped up by the alt right conservative Republicans, but, this show tries hard to be woke yet completely misses why people loved the OG. It’s the same reason why people love Succession and even White Lotus. We love rich messy petty bitches who fight over dumb things.

One of the characters on the show literally said “Who knew people loved it when rich people fought” 

also, most of the characters are fucking boring and holier than thou. Obie, Julian are two of the biggest hypocrites in the show. They always call others out for being terrible yet they do something shitty then act shocked Pikachu face when they get called out for their bullshit.

There’s a fucking throuple in the show and somehow they made that god damn boring.

I couldn’t care less about Kate and her bullshit.

also, wasted potential. The characters who have the chance to be interesting like Max, Aki, and Luna and Monet aren’t focused on enough.

It’s giving Legacies. Shitty writing, relying on the OG show, then expecting the audience to like it when it’s just horrible. Yet never putting effort into the show itself.

Edit-forgot I had more to vent about

It also was like weirdly scared to be daring even though it’s an HBO show where they have no limits

The OG show’s entire point was to piss off parents to get people to watch and get people talking. The promo posters where like “Parental Advisory” or “Parents hate that their kids watch the show”  

The OG show had a threesome between Dan, Vanessa and Hillary Duff and that showed more than the threesome on the HBO show! 

Like the reboot wanted to be edgy but barely was edgy."
Gossip Girl,Why remake such a legendary show so badly
Gossip Girl,Good. It was terrible and I don’t get why they decided for a gossip girl reboot when the og finished in 2012-which wasn’t that long ago.
Gossip Girl,This show had no idea what to do with its characters. Season 2 was an improvement but still felt like it was cycling through plots very quickly.
Gossip Girl,It was so dumb. And I like a wide variety of garbage.
Gossip Girl,"The best character in this reboot was Luna, who was underutilised soooo much. I was surprised they gave her a story in season 2, if only for one episode.

She waltzed in, gave her advise, gave full camp just like OG GG and then floated away every episode. Luna and Monet made season 2 watch able"
Gossip Girl,Too wine and poorly written. The writers used every stereotype used against Gen Z and ran with it
Gossip Girl,Friendly space ninja must be rejoicing
Gossip Girl,"Being a fan of the original show, I gave season 1 a shot. That's time I'll never get back. They cannot make underage sex, (especially as their main plotline) appealing, it's just so disconcerting and pervy to me. The original show had it, but it wasn't the whole focus, it was more background and wasn't shoved down your throat. It was more realistic teenage scenarios.

This was just dressing up pubescent dolls as adults with adult language, immature storylines and totally gratuitous eye candy to try and make up for the lack of anything compelling. It felt like a fan fic show, updated with smartphones and new fashion designers."
Gossip Girl,"This show was everything Republican think television is.

Everyone was gay/bi/racially diverse/drug addicts/sex addicts and the show basically condones drug use and normalizes the sexualization of children. I know the actors aren’t kids, but having grown adults play kids and shooting the sex scenes the way they did was absolutely a terrible oversight (at best)

Anyway, it sucks and I had fun watching it. Glad it’s canceled"
Gossip Girl,TIL there was a gossip girl reboot
Gossip Girl,"Good, my ex loved the old show so I’m glad they canceled it because she will hate that!"
Gossip Girl,I’m sure pretty little liars is next
Gossip Girl,Xoxo
Gossip Girl,"It's actually impressive how many HBO Max-specific shows ended up bombing. Whoever tried to run the Max streaming arm failed utterly at adding value to the legacy HBO network. 

Under the Max brand they managed to release two of the most panned shows ever in IMDB/RT history, Santa Inc and Velma, as well as early cancellations of a huge portion of their Max shows. 

In fact I think they'd be in a better position if they had just kept HBO GO and just put HBO on streaming, without wasting billions on MAX releases. 

HBO Max is mostly a failure only saved because of legacy HBO releases like HOTD, White Lotus, and Last of Us."
Gossip Girl,It was an awful show. So not surprised at all.
Gossip Girl,I can’t believe it got another season. I’m an OG GG fan and this was impossible to watch.
Gossip Girl,"I was literally just thinking about catching up on season 2. Eh, May still watch it for the Friendly Space Ninja video."
Gossip Girl,"Nooooo, I actually liked this reboot. But not surprised given the creator asked more people to tune into the show via social media."
Gossip Girl,"That's awesome! It was so trash and absurd, with the teachers stalking and spying the students and the students with some nonsense storylines. Too much."
Gossip Girl,I really like how they’re trying to make HBO as shit as cable /s
Gossip Girl,"Everyone wanted to start their own streaming service instead of just licensing content.  

They are realizing that streaming services are expensive to build and maintain.  

They had it pretty good before.  Now they have to cancel shows just to stay afloat."
Gossip Girl,How I met your father and that 90s show is next 💀
Gossip Girl,"Of course, HBO needs the slot for Velma season 2"
Gossip Girl,OK. Now do Velma.
Gossip Girl,I can’t wait to see Friendly Space Ninja talking about Season 2.
Gossip Girl,I wonder why streamers are having such a hard time with the teen market. Even Netflix is more miss than hit.
Gossip Girl,I stopped watching when they showed a girl trying to eat her BF’s ass….
Gossip Girl,"Remember when there were just a few channels, shows got cancelled and everyone just said “oh look there’s a new show at 8 tonight”? Good times."
Gossip Girl,highkey thought that was nick kroll from the thumbnail
Gossip Girl,Good
Gossip Girl,Oh damn
Gossip Girl,Finally!!!!!
Gossip Girl,I was hate watching this every Thursday but it never got better.
Gossip Girl,Show was utter trash. No idea who in the hell decided to do a spin-off of one the MOST successful shows in history.
Gossip Girl,"Gossip girl here…

Where?"
Gossip Girl,"With cost cutting at HBO Max in general and them getting out of programming for the younger female demo this is no surprise. When Sex Lives of College Girls ends that will be it for YA female programming on the network. 

I’m also expecting them to axe Doom Patrol, Titans, and Pennyworth to save some cash. All failed to chart on Nielsen just like Gossip Girl."
Gossip Girl,Go piss girl
Gossip Girl,We’re seconds to midnight…. But OK.
Gossip Girl,Digging this cancel culture lately.
Gossip Girl,How about that racist Velma show?
Gossip Girl,"I liked OG, but stopped watching it after ep1.
Euphoria has more teen show appeal:  messed-up energy."
Gossip Girl,Evil has finally been defeated
Gossip Girl,The second season was actually fun - RIP!
Gossip Girl,"Wait, there was a reboot of a vapid show from years ago? Why?"
Gossip Girl,Noooooo there were so many hot people
Gossip Girl,"And this happens when someone pander to woke people.  It’s proven time and time 
again that these people are unreliable and shouldn’t be taken seriously.

Why entertainment industry haven’t learned anything yet is beyond me."
Gossip Girl,"Watched both seasons. Saw the show as a camp, fun to ridicule, so bad it’s good, absolute escape wreck. Most obnoxious:  sex scenes couples didn’t match.  Big tall girl and puny guy. The trio was freaky, but Aki hair a turn off. Max looked way too old for high school. I’m fact, most the actors looked too old. Best part of the sow - Juliens earrings"
Gossip Girl,That’s 2 seasons too many.
Gossip Girl,Who could live up to Blake Lively?
Gossip Girl,"Are you freaking kidding me? I thought it was a hit show. I guess Reddit did not post anything about it, so I had now idea season 2 was airing."
Gossip Girl,"Wow.  Not a fan of the show (new or original), but I was finally getting around to Season 1 of The White Lotus on the app for the past couple days and the homepage had this front and center.  Gives off Barry S3 vibes."
Gossip Girl,Should have let the original show alone and not reboot it into trash.
Gossip Girl,Netflix does it better.
Gossip Girl,"This is unsurprising. A little disappointing maybe. Not in the sense that it's good or anything, but I do feel like right now there's more potential for it to maybe get good than there has been in its entire run."
Gossip Girl,"Honestly I know the first season had some problems getting its footing especially with the 'pc, woke' characterizations but I was enjoying tuning in and turning off my brain for an hour this second season. Euphoria is too much sometimes and the netflix teen dramas are a bit cringey (aimed at a way younger demographic). Would have loved to continue watching - it is what it is."
Gossip Girl,"Not surprise. Xoxo. They should just make conspiracy boys, a much better entertainment"
Gossip Girl,i enjoyed it. felt like it was just hitting its stride.
Gossip Girl,Shucks.
Gossip Girl,"Good, it was a trash show anyway"
Gossip Girl,Finally good news
Gossip Girl,"I watched season one, and I managed to watch the whole season because I wanted it to be good until I realized it won't but I only have one or two episodes left so I just decided to finish it. After all that, I can say it's the worst tv I've watched in 2021 (if not ever)."
Gossip Girl,"From the first episode, it had a lot of issues and it kept getting worse. People already had doubts before it premiered due to the showrunner, who had been responsible for ruining the OG when the original creators took a step back after season 1, as well as wrecking Smash when he came on board in season 2."
Gossip Girl,I waited for this show for a long time but couldn't get past the first few eps of s1... it's bad imo
Gossip Girl,"What a shame I have enjoyed this season a lot more than season 1. I enjoyed season 1 too, but this one feels like they are starting to hit their stride. Georgina and the De Hans have been good villains."
Gossip Girl,The fact the show had 6 episodes and then disappeared for a couple months didn't help either. I kept meaning to continue to watch the show but I just kept forgetting about it.
Gossip Girl,I'm not surprised by this decision. The previews I saw for season 1 made the reboot look vastly inferior to the original. The article says the creators are shopping the series for a new home. I really wish they would just let it be. They caught lightning in a bottle with the original. I can't see them doing that again with any type of reboot.
Gossip Girl,Another woke show cancelled. 😂
Gossip Girl,What was wrong with the first season? Haven’t watched it but curious
Gossip Girl,"My problem with watching this was that I saw it on HBO Max, remembered there was an original version and this was a remake. Thought I should watch the original one first, so I watched six seasons of that. Then I wanted to take a break before watching this version, and now it’s already cancelled before I can watch it. 

The original being on HBO Max may have inadvertently got this cancelled lol."
Gossip Girl,"Gossip girl is supposed to be CAMP, like that’s kind of the entire point. The minute the show seems like it’s taking itself too seriously it loses all the appeal. Mm watcha say playing over dramatic confessions during an elaborate thanksgiving dinner? That’s giving the audience what it wants!

This new version took itself entirely too seriously which ruined the fun of watching rich people be messy and stupid."
Gossip Girl,"I remember the original, or at least hearing about it. I genuinely wasn't aware this reboot existed."
Gossip Girl,And don't forget about the teachers. No one cared about the teachers. I didn't see a single person say a single positive thing about them. Yet a good sixth of each episode's time was dedicated to them being weird and bullying/stalking teenagers?
Gossip Girl,">I can actually write a full ass dissertation on why this show floppes

This made me laugh so thanks for that. Great write-up of likely reasons why the show failed."
Gossip Girl,">It does a lot more telling then showing.

I only watch the first half of S1 so maybe these students truly became messy later.

The whole concept that the school staff is Gossip Girl is ridiculous at best (creepy and criminal at worst). But the show constantly tells us that these grown adults are justified in their actions because these new students are that awful. And... are they? The new GG leaked that Julien post a fatshaming tweet when she was in middle school or that Max is getting preyed on by a fellow teacher (you'd think that they would try to jail that man instead of posting CP for clout!). What have these kids done that deserves that level of bullying from grown-ass adults? The show never shows us!"
Gossip Girl,"The throuple storyline of are-we-aren’t-we was so annoying and went on for way. too. long. Then nobody’s actions in the show seem normal for any reasonable human being.

Teachers obsessed with bringing down their bratty students by stalking and manipulating them: you’re telling me not ONE teacher had the conscience and maturity to nope out or go to admin about this inappropriate behavior?

The teacher who is outed having sex with his student and then suffers no consequences? Excuse me, what?

Remember when the parents found out about the throuple and said they were “proud of them?” I’m no prude but I’d be discussing safe sex with my kid at the very least.

Julien is literally the worst person ever and vacillates from vapid rich girl to someone ethical who cares about societal injustices 20 times per episode.

Obie is just a rich boy prop to be thrown back and forth between Julien and her sister (forgot her name). Also, the sister is supposedly poor but always showing up places with designer clothes on. And the apartment she and her dad live in… I know it’s supposed to be her grandma’s.. but that ain’t no working class dwelling.

The blonde teacher who largely runs Gossip Girl is SO INSUFFERABLE. She acts like a twelve year old the entire time. 

What am I missing?"
Gossip Girl,"I watched the pilot and vowed I wouldn’t watch any more after they made the teachers Gossip Girl and had them stalking teenagers. I always said that Josh Schwartz missed the whole point of “Gossip Girl,” like who cares who Gossip Girl actually is."
Gossip Girl,"It has a lot of potential, but they would bring up stories, interesting plot devices and even characters etc every other episode only to drop it entirely the next episode and not acknowledge it."
Gossip Girl,"[Friendly Space Ninja’s review](https://youtu.be/VVRiaadXG88) is basically a thesis on why this show is dogshit. It’s among the funniest things I’ve watched. I never watched the original GG and this one, but the main points I got is that: those teachers should get fired or arrested for wasting their free time stalking and harassing their students, the show tries so hard to be socially-aware even the most staunch social justice activists would roll their eyes, and that girl with the shaved head is such a terrible actress. It’s like she’s reading off cue cards in a school play."
Gossip Girl,"Even the more feminists forums thought it was silly of the show to attempt to be more “woke” given that the appeal of the OG show was the plight of pretty white rich people getting into trouble. Honestly, did anyone think this version was better due to the kids taking Ubers instead of limos?"
Gossip Girl,I think they were setting up Monet and Zoya to be love interests too with the current episodes.👀
Gossip Girl,This is on HBO? Why would they bother when they have euphoria?
Gossip Girl,"Some of the show is stellar. Remove the teachers, obie, maybe julian, definitely zoya, and keep the rest. Like Legacies they really got some great young actors and then wasted them."
Gossip Girl,"In season 1, Luna and Monet were barely doing anything.

Some of those cast members are terrible at acting: the one who plays Julien acts like soap opera actors in SNL skits. Dude who plays Aki is not even trying to deliver his lines.

Storyline-wise, some characters are really lost: Luna, Monet (things got a little better for her in season 2, but it doesn't really make sense), Obie's storyline is a hot mess, Aki is also lost without the throuple. Even Zoya has been so lost lately which sucks because she'd be the perfect ""outsider but not so much""

Now, one character that amazed me so much was Max. He was supposed to be the Chuck and almost fooled me, but he brings such a sweetness and vulnerability to Max, it's impossible not to love him. I love when Max and Luna interact, they have an amazing friendship that feels really genuine, but we only get glimpses of that.

All in all let's all remember that even though the original GG was really iconic, that show was a hot mess most of the time. I remember, I lived through it (and rewatched it a few times, because why not)."
Gossip Girl,This show feels like they gave Disney channel writers the green light to make another Euphoria.
Gossip Girl,When did Chuck and Dan ever become friends? Did I miss a storyline?
Gossip Girl,Gossip Girl but there's no gossiping because that's mean.
Gossip Girl,"It is, “I couldn’t care less”. By saying you ‘could care less’ you are saying you do care."
Gossip Girl,"I haven't seen past the first half of season 1 - have they introduced a rapist that they try to make you feel sorry for?

Also the two  sisters were so boring omg"
Gossip Girl,:shocked_pikachu_face:
Gossip Girl,"Legacies was at least fun.  

This show made me roll my eyes at a thruple because it was so boring.

I liked the first season.  The second season took everything bad about the first season and made it worse.  One of the sixteen year old characters was sleeping with a married man.  Kids are having mdma delivered to their homes so they can take it and have sex while their parents are downstairs (which somehow ends up being boring)."
Gossip Girl,It’s not really a remake
Gossip Girl,$$$$ and brand Recognition
Gossip Girl,Same reason they are rebooting True Blood. 💀
Gossip Girl,That sounds exactly like the Original plus OC (Schwartz's other show) which would do about four seasons of storylines in a single season.
Gossip Girl,Right?  I'll watch most everything of this type and I quit a couple episodes in this season.
Gossip Girl,"agreed re: luna, loved her episode last week. with her, max, and audrey the actors are punching soooo far above their weight to try to make the scenes work."
Gossip Girl,"They had a beautiful latina transgender actress and did exactly nothing with her.  People were even asking during the first season if the character was transgender because they didn't mention a thing about it.

Her character in the netflix show she was in was so much better.  I didn't need her entire personality to be that she's trans but they could have mentioned it when she was getting ready at some point."
Archer,"Parnell:

>""I think you got a pretty good sense of the big shift that happened with season 13 without Mallory around, sadly, without Jessica. But yeah, I think it's gonna be more of us doing spy stuff, but we've just started recording season 14, so it remains to be seen what else is gonna happen."""
Archer,"If FXX doesn't pick it up for another season, I'm sure another network or streaming service will. It could just become a Hulu exclusive. I think it has a big enough fan base."
Archer,I really hope Archer finally gets a happy ending…. Phrasing!
Archer,"I loved the Danger Island season, I was a big fan of Tales of the Gold Monkey as a kid. 

&#x200B;

The noir one wasn't bad either."
Archer,"Skip ahead a few months...

Headline: **FXX Cancels 'Archer' Despite Season 14 Being Recorded**"
Archer,"I’m honestly asking, Is archer actually still good? I don’t think I’ve watch since season 7 after archer was left dying in a pool or something like that. Is the series still worth watching at this point?"
Archer,"“You’re so ugly when you cry, bwhaap”"
Archer,DANGER ZONE!
Archer,Mallory was by far my favorite character and when Jessica died I haven't watched an episode since. I didn't even finish the season she was still in because I was so upset about it. What are people thoughts on the newest season without her?
Archer,I bet Chris can do a good Rick..
Archer,"Don’t get me wrong. I love archer and all, but everytime I see a new season I’m like oh, they’re still continuing this show? I thought it was over a long time ago."
Archer,I stopped after season 4 or 5 when it seemed to go off the rails and was no longer about being spies. It's it worth picking back up?
Archer,I lost interest in this show so long ago I can't believe it's on season 14. I can't imagine it's that great considering it started get bad like 10 seasons ago.
Archer,"It's one of my favorite shows, even though I haven't watched since Vice.

I'd really like to see Frisky Dingo get a real conclusion."
Archer,Cool so worst case scenario we'll get an audio drama
Archer,"Has this show done anything good/fun since season 9? (being generous)

That's kinda where I fell off as a fan. I'd love to hear it got a resurgence though."
Archer,Yessss!!!
Archer,I lost interest once Lana got pregnant. It wasn’t as fun anymore 😩
Archer,"I didn't know this show was still airing. I liked the first few seasons, but it should have ended when Archer became a dad. The characters got old really fast for me."
Archer,Next season we see if Lana truly falls to the dark side and becomes the next Mallory
Archer,I had no idea this show was still on. I assumed it ended years ago.
Archer,You want ants? Cause this is how you get ants.
Archer,so what exactly is left now? just family guy and American dad I guess.
Archer,If FXX drops the ball Hulu will pick it up.  They already proved that with Orville and season 3 of that show was by FAR the best.
Archer,Well that's unfortunate /s
Archer,checked out after whatever season it was where they were helping the hollywood starlet. tried to go back and watch the coma seasons but i just couldn’t get into em.
Archer,tragic that archer got 14 seasons and frisky dingo got 2
Archer,"Lana Lana Lanaaaaaaaaaaa, What?!?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Danger Zone!"""
Archer,"Hulu pick it up and make it TV-MA.

They're hitting their stride again."
Archer,The show isn’t funny anymore
Archer,I think the newer seasons are okay but I also think it should’ve ended after he got shot and went it the coma
Archer,Great
Archer,"Got lost on the show after the mini sub into the body, then then he died, then he was dreaming, and Im just like wtf is going on"
Archer,I cannot believe this show is still going.
Archer,"Maybe just let it die with dignity? I haven't laughed since s10, and even then, it was a lot less than previous seasons."
Archer,Phrasing Boom!!! Something something mash potatoes!!!woooooooo
Archer,13 year olds rejoice in stupidity
Archer,So he's just sitting around the house saying shit into an 8-track?
Archer,"""WoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooHooooooooooooooooooHooooooooooooo"""
Archer,"When Malloy died Archer lost the base for any humor. She was the glue, it’s hard to watch now you expect her cutting remarks"
Archer,"will netflix be buying it, since they got the first seasons?"
Archer,"Good. Get on the ball, FXX!"
Archer,Spooge!
Archer,"You’re a loose canon, Cody"
Archer,Cheesy Pete!
Archer,I learned the watermelon (Charleston Gray) is man made from Archer.
Archer,Yea chris is gonna have some more stuff to get used to now that roiland is off rick n morty. Jerry for the carry
Archer,"Shit, I had no idea she died, and like 2 years ago…"
Archer,"I gotta be honest i love archer but even before the whole mallory thing the shows quality seemed to be going downhill... and i dont think its anything specific, at least i havent paid too much attention.

It's just a matter of the whole cliche getting a bit stale? It's just had its run in my opinion and the first like 7- 8 seasons are gold but idk its just kinds the same thing with different window dressing at this point, theyre kinda out of ideas and i mean how can you NOT be at that point? 

Idk love archer but want to let it die instead of drag itself out into a carcass of itself like the simpsons did."
Archer,"well, if netflix can accept seasons of craps like paradise pd they should for sure pick this one."
Archer,"> I think it has a big enough fan base.

This comment section would beg to disagree, as it's 50 people who don't watch the show complaining about how much better it used to be

I don't get it. I've watched Archer like 3 times - there isn't a huge difference between the earlier seasons and current as far as comedy is concerned. It's still awesome."
Archer,came to say this exact comment word for word with nothing else to follow
Archer,"Hulu and FXX are both Disney. I guess it's separate buckets, but it's the same company.

Hence why Archer is part of the FX on Hulu branding."
Archer,S13 was fire and a return to form. I am hopeful they will get renewed or find a new home as well.
Archer,"I don't even get why it's not currently on Hulu (US)/Disney+, FXX is owned by Disney is it not?"
Archer,"Well a lot of things FX makes now is stuff for Hulu, so I could see it becoming a Hulu Exclusive"
Archer,I can see Hulu picking it up for a few season till popularity dwindles past a certain mark.
Archer,So does archer....
Archer,"I would not mind death ending. All things considered... things always turned Archers way anyway.

Prayed for them killing off Pam since the coke season... they caricatured the shit out of that character and in the end she was just insufferable whenever on screen."
Archer,I kinda lost interest after the space season. Danger island was one of the most solid seasons
Archer,"If I could pick one 80's show to bring back, it'd be Tales of the Gold Monkey."
Archer,I loved the Noir season and really liked the Danger Island season.
Archer,"I keep the Tales of the Golden Monkey DVD box set in the minivan, and micro-watch it on the infotainment screen while the kids do their various activities… Also have Brisco County Jr. in the car…"
Archer,I know this is a joke but is this possible/has this ever happened?
Archer,"I wouldn't put it as must see, but I wouldn't put it as unwatchable garbage either. 

You *can* skip seasons 8-10 and just go to 11, but personally I thought the noir and pulp adventure seasons were pretty good, the space one not so much. After that it's regular Archer for 11-13."
Archer,"i like it. the island season was great, and hes out of a coma now but they did multiple seasons basically inside archers mind."
Archer,"I’ve just got to danger island and tbh all the jokes feel the same over and over, might leave it for a while before picking it up again"
Archer,"There is a few coma seasons. The first few were good but I didn’t like the last one. There’s been a couple of seasons where he’s out of the coma and I think they’ve been pretty good, just not as good as the first few seasons"
Archer,"I haven't watched season 13, and I took a long time off from it before I caught up on the coma seasons, but these days, I can enjoy the entire series. Everyone wants to nitpick about what they like and dislike about every season, for instance the early seasons were more like sketch comedy and the later seasons are way more serialized. TBH I'm not sure 35 year old me would still be enjoying Archer if it had just been season after season of sketch comedy and callbacks that I enjoyed 10 years ago. In many ways it's a good thing they stopped doing ""phrasing,"" to put it in a way. They've adapted in a lot of ways that has always kept the show fresh and it's still pretty damn entertaining, looking forward to 13 and hopefully 14 as well."
Archer,"It’s still good, as good as it always was. If anything it’s stale, but the quality of writing and production have not fallen"
Archer,"If you like the show, it is still the show. 

It really hasn't shifted fundamentally from where it started even when they were playing with different settings and character changes.

 Even when Krieger is a bird for a season, he still feels like Krieger and the show still feels like Archer, you know? 

A lot changes, but it hasn't lost the original charm or appeal."
Archer,I fell off at this time too. Last year I picked it back up and binged the coma seasons and honestly they were great and I had a ton of fun watching them all back to back.
Archer,It’s not. You watched till season 7. So did I. We both watched 2 more seasons than we should; hoping for quality.
Archer,"Season 9 is a good place to stop, though I felt s10 had a few high points. 11 and 12 aren't funny at all, and don't even feel like Archer anymore. I only managed two episodes of s13. Thinking I had maybe gotten bored of the style I went back to some random s3 episode and was laughing out loud within a minute. 🪦🏹"
Archer,It’s no longer funny
Archer,I just discovered Archer a couple months ago and I liked it up until the pool scene. After that it was three seasons of nonsense. They lost me after that and I moved on like the rest of the crew did when he was in the coma.
Archer,It's a sad season without her but the characters are all trying to do right by her and honor her legacy.
Archer,"It’s not the same, of course, but I was pleasantly surprised."
Archer,She got a really nice sendoff so I would recommend you to at least finish the season.
Archer,I'm rewatching Archer from season 1 and damn do I miss Jessica's voice.
Archer,"I really enjoyed the new season, they are back doing spy stuff and it was really fun. Can't wait for more."
Archer,"Her final episode is phenomenal. Perfect way to send off a character like that.

The season they did without her was also very good. The whole premise was they no longer had Mallory as their leader so naturally everything goes wrong. Good way to honour Jessica"
Archer,"Good or not, I kinda want to hear his impression now."
Archer,Exactly my take. I remember being disappointed in Season 4
Archer,Good luck with that. We've got a better chance of waiting out Venture Bros
Archer,"Lmao, right?

The thing that surprises me is that when this came up on the Archer sub, it was mentioned that the delay in getting renewed was because of issues with the animation department and that other shows from the company were also put on hold. So your comment was my legit first thought, like okay they either resolved whatever was going on or it’s just going to be their voices lmao."
Archer,"The answer is entirely subjective and varies from person to person as you can see if you browse r/ArcherFX. 

Some fans weren’t fond of the coma seasons (8,9,10) because they just wanted the characters to be in their original settings. Others were fond of them, as they were written by Adam Reed still before he stepped away. 

Then, for seasons 11 and 12 they were back in their original settings. I mostly liked them. But then season 13 came out and I found myself full on disliking episodes. 

My point is, no one knows what the answer is besides you. The producers have said that the network is happy with them. They still get views. So yeah."
Archer,"Season 11 was post coma, back to spy stuff and it was actually good though the final episode was a bit meh. Season 12 was decent overall but had too much focus on Lana who became the worst character on the show and undid a bunch of cool stuff from season 11, then 13 happened which was heavily focused on Kayvan Novak's character who is painfully unfunny, extremely annoying and a karma Houdini until the last episode which does not give him a cathartic enough punishment."
Archer,"Best case? It's a great episode and you have fun. 

Worst case? It's a decent background show. 

Either way, it's 20 minutes. If you had something better to do you'd be doing it."
Archer,"It has ups and downs. I didn't care for the noir coma season, but I liked the island and scifi coma seasons. Once Archer woke up, I enjoyed the show even more. The latest season felt... for lack of a better word, empty without Mallory, but it wasn't bad. It's just a huge change to lose such a central character. I'm looking forward to the next season, given some of the developments we've had the past few seasons.

The show isn't at its best, but I think it's got some creativity left in it. It's worth giving it a shot, just to see if it still has something left for you."
Archer,But… OUTLAW COUNTRY!
Archer,I’m surprised people here are saying that FX would be ‘dropping the ball’ by cancelling the show. They’ve seen the show through 13 seasons!
Archer,Bob's Burgers got 2 more seasons... 🙄
Archer,yet 18+ months and still no word on season 4
Archer,"they grew on me tbh, the island one where he's a pilot specifically."
Archer,"And a short lived (2 episodes) spin-off in The Xtacles. 

Incidentally, it still has one of my favorite lines in a comedy cartoon of all time (""You mean there's a rapey-er ape?"")"
Archer,This like going in to work even if you’re not scheduled. Imma going to get my weekly hours one way or another.
Archer,I’m not dismissing Malory and I agree but have you considered that they can just write a new character to fill that gap?
Archer,Shouldn't Mallory have a bad ass younger sister.. Arches aunt? That might be a new twist. They are chasing down a rogue agent and They keep seeing Mallory.. but it's her sister. Eventually she assumes control of ISIS.
Archer,Phrasing!
Adventure Time,Dukie going Bubbles was rough.
Adventure Time,"A lot of David Simon stuff does that. Generation Kill had a similar scene to end the miniseries. Excellent series, btw. If you liked The Wire, you should check it out."
Adventure Time,But the true ending is the final adventure time special.
Adventure Time,so do a ton of other shows
Adventure Time,I think a lot of shows end like this. Dragon Ball GT and Hunter x Hunter did as well.
Adventure Time,"Syndor becomes the new McNulty. Michael becomes Omar. Slim becomes the new Prop* Joe. Dukie becomes the new Bibbles. Valchek becomes the new Burrel.

The ending of season 5 is clear. Players change but the game stays the same."
Adventure Time,Yeah that one hurt.  Guessing the show runners did it to really drive home the point of how difficult it was to escape that life / grind of poverty. Dukie seemed like the kid most likely to escape and even he couldn’t make it out.
Adventure Time,"I agree, with the home video recap at the end. Great series!"
Adventure Time,Hunter X Hunter is still going on.
Adventure Time,Isn't his name Prop Joe?
Adventure Time,100% was the point. There were so many various depressing ends of characters/stories in that series. Def one of my fav all-time shows.
Adventure Time,Talking about the anime. I know it's still going on I read the manga every week. Chrollos backstory was great.
Adventure Time,Im about to binge the last 10 chapters. Ive been patient so I can it all in at once. Best arc yet.
Adventure Time,Yeah for most series we'd be looking back on the Chimera Ant arc as the peak but he's somehow managed to surpass it. Such a godlike series.
Adventure Time,Joe Pera
Adventure Time,"Adventure Time is one of my favourite series of all time. The creativity and imagination and ideas it’s plays with over its whole run is incredible. From multiverses, time travel and nuclear Armageddon, to building trucks with a Banana man, helping a horse get its groove back and a dog wanting to be a brick, it’s able to tell so many amazing stories. I love being in the world of Ooo."
Adventure Time,"I'm twice your age and I'm not ashamed to say I love Adventure Time, for many of the same reasons you do.

Good luck with that sleep thing, I still don't have it worked out - I control my circadian rhythm with (legal) drugs."
Adventure Time,"Let me throw Regular Show and Gumball in the mix. A testament to a good kids movie or show is its ability to be good when you remove the kids aspect, Regular Show, Adventure Time & Gumball do this. Regular Shows ending was fantastic and very mature."
Adventure Time,"This 45 yo, his 38 yo wife their 2 teen daughters and 10 yo son all completely agree. It is the one show we all agree on, and we don’t all agree in much"
Adventure Time,"I'm finding The Owl House a pretty solid spiritual sibling, if you're looking for one. It has that ""Genuinely solid comedy + horror flavored cartoon world"" combo Adventure Time always hit for me, where it was cute but rarely saccharine, and the underlying themes could be pretty grown up."
Adventure Time,I am a huge fan of AT. Now *Bluey* hits those notes.
Adventure Time,"""Haha tricked again by the river of forgetfulness!""

I don't know why but that exchange sold me on the show way back :D"
Adventure Time,Jake the Brick is one of my all time favorite episodes of TV.
Adventure Time,"I just watched this for the first time with my 9 year old I'm 38, and we both really enjoyed it"
Adventure Time,I'm turning 25 next month and I feel that same sense of comfort. I remember growing up with this show and Finn growing up along with me. It was one of the only cartoons where they aged the character up as it went on. I have tons of good memories tied to the show so it's always nice to turn on an episode.
Adventure Time,"To me, Adventure Time doesn't pick up until half way through its 10 seasons. Whenever the show started developing the lore through a cohesive story between episodes, instead of the random equals funny type of humor that was so prevalent early on.

Definitely a show I'd recommend if you have the patience for it. But it's a slow ride."
Adventure Time,"AT is legit one of my favorite shows of all time, though I liked it much more when it was pure, random surreal comedy and balls-to-the-wall weirdness before they started listening to the Tumblr contingent and adding all that lore and mythology and continuity."
Adventure Time,I really hope the Fionna and Cake show is still happening and Zaslov didn't scrap it...
Adventure Time,Summer Camp Island is so sweet it'll turn your blood to syrup.
Adventure Time,"Mmmm for me I need to be two blunts in before I can enjoy it.

Edit: also not encouraging you to if you don't part take but a nice aforementioned blunt is a good way to go to sleep fast without the side effects of alcohol or benadryl and other depresnts."
Adventure Time,You sound like your in a narrate your own life hole. Also probably wicked stoned
Adventure Time,This so much! That show is like a warm hug. I love the hell out of that character! Like how can you not love it when he shoots the shit with the supermarket sample guy?!
Adventure Time,Absolutely. A lovely thing to watch before one goes to sleep.
Adventure Time,"Would say The Owl House is more in line with Gravity Falls, totally.  There’s not really anything quite like Adventure Time."
Adventure Time,"Yeah, I miss the random, morbid humor from the earlier seasons."
Adventure Time,The surreal comedy and weirdness mixed with its level of lore and continuity is what *makes* it amazing.
Adventure Time,Smoking pot before bed does have similar side effects to alcohol. It fucks with your REM sleep. I used to pretty much not dream at all when I smoked it right before or very close to sleeping. Now I stop at least an hour (usually more) before bed and dream every night.
Adventure Time,"The heavy episodes always get the most attention, but I've always preferred the lighter, ""adventure"" type episodes. Dungeon Train was a masterpiece."
Adventure Time,"I started watching Adventure Time around this time. Unbelievable that this show has been with me this long, and that it's been 10 years! One of my favorite shows of all time.

Although my favorite episode has always been ""The Eyes"". Gotta love that horse."
Adventure Time,"So as someone who hasnt watched it, im guessing the ""king"" guy got some kind of ""dementia"" and is a villain when he gets the ""episodes?"
Adventure Time,Shit got me crying in the bed
Adventure Time,"Adventure time is such a phenomenal show.

The character development, emotional maturity, story, so much about it is phenomenal."
Adventure Time,Death in Bloom is my favourite episode. It’s just perfect.
Adventure Time,"Such a good episode.  Turns Ice King from a cartoonish bad guy into a real person with a tragic history.  Did the arguably right thing, knowing it would ultimately hurt himself.  And seeing Marceline's pain and anger with Ice King really hits you."
Adventure Time,Ocean of Fear is the first episode I loved
Adventure Time,Well I didn't expect to have a smoke session followed by a mid day cry but here we are.
Adventure Time,I'm rewatching this currently. Such a great show..
Adventure Time,So that's what we're doing today?  Just making people cry?
Adventure Time,"This is a masterpiece of storytelling, I might get shit for saying that but it really is."
Adventure Time,Such a good episode.
Adventure Time,Introduced my partner to this recently and she is loving it. I can’t wait till we make it to this episode one of the best imo.
Adventure Time,Man for it being what it was this show had some super deep moments and it was amazing
Adventure Time,This was such a great show
Adventure Time,This episode still makes me cry.
Adventure Time,"That shows lore was way too deep, and its writing way too good for Cartoon Network. I know too many people who passed on it until I made them watch a couple episodes."
Adventure Time,I play both the songs from this episode on guitar all the time. So good.
Adventure Time,"The one with the ice creature and the fire wolf was the first one I saw. Fell in love with it immediately. I loved the little lived in details, like the pinecones breakfast cereal."
Adventure Time,"Best episode is Hall of Egress.  This is a really good one too though. To the downvoter: go watch Hall of Egress, and then tell me I'm wrong."
Adventure Time,There are better episodes (even ranked by IMDb) but this was a great episode to show how the ice king wasn’t just some insane weirdo obsessed with princesses but a tragic character you could feel sorry for
Adventure Time,"I mean, that was a good one, but that wasn't light at all. It was about obsessive escapism in the face of chronic depression."
Adventure Time,Well it inspired what I believe to be the best animated show I’ve ever seen
Adventure Time,"Very fun, but also a pretty real look at video game addiction"
Adventure Time,Hall of Egress tread the line pretty good.
Adventure Time,The episode with Magic Man has always been my favorite.
Adventure Time,"Episodes like this that very obviously are lore heavy usually aren’t as interesting to me as the ones that just casually drop lore. The episode of Jake pretending to be a rainicorn where we found out about the crystal dimension war, humans being extinct and everyone eating soy human was one of my favorites."
Adventure Time,Death in Bloom was always my favorite.
Adventure Time,"I agree about the lighter episodes 

Bears bears bears bears bears bears bears bears"
Adventure Time,"I posted the Hall of Egress thread in the subreddit all those years ago. That was a real trip, and one of the best episodes.

This episode (I Remember You) is far and away the best episode of the show, but I do agree that the ""true art is angsty"" trope can get a little out of hand."
Adventure Time,Rainy Day Daydream is mine
Adventure Time,Just picturing that fucking horse still makes me laugh out loud.
Adventure Time,He's definitely no James Baxter.
Adventure Time,That horse is whack ... With poo brain
Adventure Time,"Spot on, yep, but this plot line is introduced only after a long time of the king being kind of a kooky pain in the ass who bugs everyone until now.

This ep tells us that his personality is because he was once a human who used a magic crown to prolong his life long enough to take care of Marceline (who isn't human and so ages slower and lives far longer), after the post apocalypse.

He doesn't remember her, but she starts figuring out how to maintain a kind of relationship with him anyway, and like you say it works as an analogy for something like dementia or mental illness.

It's so deftly done in the ep it's easy to forget it functions as a fairly significant retcon, and in fact it almost works better because we've had little or no hints of this. It is expanded further from here, Marceline is one of the show's most long lived characters so she lived through a lot of the stuff the show only really sprinkles in as flavor most of the time. 

The fact the whole show is set in the aftermath of an nuclear extinction war rather than a naturally magical wonderland was, for a long time, something you could mostly only infer from blink-and-you'll-miss-it bits of background imagery."
Adventure Time,"u/Archamasse said it perfectly to add.

He’s not just a goofy villain he’s a kids show punching bag to this point. He’s the butt of most jokes and the target of cartoon violence because of his villain actions (primarily trying to kidnap princesses). The show isn’t cruel but he is kicked around and treated as a pretty despicable and pathetic trash bag. At a certain point he’s not feared, just disliked very strongly, and his primarily character trait becomes trying to become best friends with the Hero despite being the antagonist. The same way young kids might be disgusted and annoyed by older family members whose mental decline is at a near terminal point but who are still trying to bond with younger family.

By contrast the girl her was at first introduced as a villain as well but in that episode the twist is that even tho she’s a scary vampire she’s really cool and mostly friendly. Classic kids show don’t judge a book by the cover. She takes on a cool older sister role who if anything is too cool for the hero and who he is still slightly scared of because he’s sorta lame compared to her. To keep going with the earlier metaphor this is like a young kid seeing a cool older sibling or cousin who he constantly want to impress bonding with an older senile relative he can’t stand/doesn’t understand. It’s confusing and heartbreaking and heartwarming.

In the show the Ice King rescued the vampire girl in the apocalypse (the show gets DEEP lore by the end) and raises her. But to protect her he needs to abuse ancient magic that melts his mind. She pities and idolizes him for that but his decision over time is shown to be more complex. Even tho it was selfless it still hurt people. It’s the most a kids show has ever unpacked very adult topics"
Adventure Time,"Yes. This was the first episode to show he and the vampire girl knew each other, and the first to show the ice king wasn't always like this. He's only a zany cartoon villain because he's ill."
Adventure Time,Pretty much. He also raised her.
Adventure Time,"""Yes"""
Adventure Time,"It's okay friend, I cried too."
Adventure Time,"To watch Finn actually grow and develop traumas and overcome some of them is actually quite impressive.

Like at 12 he's rambunctious and loves to go 100% all the time, but by the time he's 16 he's been through so much fucked up shit that we actually see him become kind of jaded to some of it. So much of it is done so well, I'm interested to see how they continue it."
Adventure Time,Adventure Time is up there with Venture Bros as the best animated show of my era. I couldn’t think of another show besides maybe the last air bender that really just was fun to watch but also contained a ton of emotional and comedic depth.
Adventure Time,You can't just go around stealing boots
Adventure Time,Sounds like you’re due for a late afternoon smoke session followed by a binge of Adventure Time because why are you not already
Adventure Time,Yea
Adventure Time,Every time
Adventure Time,Glad to see the call out for Hall of Egress. Definitely one of my favorite episodes of the show.
Adventure Time,wait adventure time inspired itself? because otherwise your comment doesnt make sense
Adventure Time,"I’m, a magic maaaaaaan

You won’t learn a lesson until you appreciate how much of a jerk I am!

Eat It!"
Adventure Time,"I hate it, because being a foot would be actually horrifying."
Adventure Time,"> poo brain

This term has been a mainstay in my house since that episode aired.  Used as a total catch-all for any amount of forgetfulness, lack of focus, confusion, etc.  
""Whoo, I got mad poo brain today!"""
Adventure Time,">It's so deftly done in the ep it's easy to forget it functions as a fairly significant retcon, and in fact it almost works better because we've had little or no hints of this

Except for the episode Holly Jolly Secrets, which tells us all about his human life pre-Mushroom War and how he found a magic crown that gives him powers but also turns him crazy."
Adventure Time,"Also his obsession with princesses is because of his wife passing, who he called princess, right?"
Adventure Time,Sounds similar to a certain character in Gravity Falls
Adventure Time,I remember that “theory” being a thing back when the show first came ou t
Adventure Time,"Ice King isn't just a standard cartoon punching bag, he's a reskinned Bowser from Mario. For years, people have joked about why Mario and Luigi and even Peach are friends with Bowser, the evil king who constantly kidnaps Peach and tries to make Mario suffer. He shoots cannons at Mario and friends, but they still let him come go-karting and play tennis with them.

Adventure Time started out as a parody of that character dynamic: ""what if Bowser was totally pathetic and desperately wanted to be liked by Mario?"" Then it delved deep into what a relationship dynamic like that would look like."
Adventure Time,[deleted]
Adventure Time,Me too!
Adventure Time,"I am late for a smoke session, and then FPS because I'd rather kill virtual things than feel those feels again so soon. Also I just finished AT again, and I try to do so once every year or two just to be like ""Wow, what an incredibly unique, and touching story"". Otherwise maybe it'll slowly lose its magic, and I love it, and want it to stay pure forever."
Adventure Time,"That episode along with a few other things inspired Infinity Train, which I believe to be the best animated show I’ve ever seen, even toping avatar and arcane, it’s painful to write about it since it’s been canceled but still"
Adventure Time,"That plotline iirc was originally written because they wanted a reason for him to know the ""daddy why did you eat my fries"" song"
Adventure Time,"Betty ran away from him when he put on the crown and lost himself the first time, Princess was what he called her and it carried over to the personality of the Ice King, which is explained as well when the lore of the crown is explored later as well"
Americas Next Top Model,"6 is pretty unanimously considered the best season. It is rife with iconic moments and characters. Iconic Final 3 and a diverse cast. 16 is also really great. Good drama, good models but the models may be unlikeable to some. 3 is amazing too. Also great drama and great models. Similarly, models may come across unlikeable. 4 is also great. Has probably the most iconic scene to come out of the show. 7 and 8 are also really good. 13 is really great in terms of modelling and photoshoots but it does lack in drama. The cast makes up for it, in my opinion. Amazing winner. 9 and 10 are also good but don't have particularly satisfying conclusions. 

Keep in mind, some seasons do spoil previous seasons. So, if spoilers are a concern then you should watch chronologically. If not, I'd watch the season listed above in that order.

After watching, do share your thoughts over at r/ANTM. Enjoy  😉."
Americas Next Top Model,I haven't watched it in years. I used to watch it in highschool but there's one season I loved. I think it was Season 6 with Joanie Dodds as my all-time favourite.
Americas Next Top Model,"Season 5 is my favorite, with Nichole and Nic and Bre."
Americas Next Top Model,The only one I've watched is the one with Creepy-chan from 4chan on it. It was alright.
Americas Next Top Model,/u/ghost-quartet
Americas Next Top Model,"I don't remember which season number it is but my all time favorite was the ""british invasion"" season tbh"
Americas Next Top Model,Cycle 6 is the funniest. I also love cycle 4 and 9.
Americas Next Top Model,is 6 the one w/ jade & gina? LOL because it is truly iconic
Americas Next Top Model,"Yep. Also Queens furonda, Danielle and Joanie. Its one of the best seasons of reality TV ever made."
Americas Next Top Model,"Whatever the circumstances this is such a horrible thing to happen to someone so young.

19 years old, RIP, such a shame. "
Americas Next Top Model,[deleted]
Americas Next Top Model,This is sad news. I wonder if her killing was related to her appearance and attitude on antm? (She did say she had an SO back home even though she liked another man on the show.)
Americas Next Top Model,[deleted]
Americas Next Top Model,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
Americas Next Top Model,"I have no idea what you're referring to but a quick google search says possibly drug related.

Americas Next Top Model,"Wait what exactly are you trying to say? 

Try being coherent."
Americas Next Top Model,Yay human empathy 
Americas Next Top Model,Oh I see. That link had more details than the previous article. Thanks
Americas Next Top Model,"What is this I don't even... with this much change, I think now is definitely time to end the show."
Americas Next Top Model,"but shes getting BRYANBOY!!!!!!!

its going to be FABULOUSSSSSSS...BABOOSH!!"
Americas Next Top Model,"All in the Family was supposed to be like that. It was a comedy about a man with a lot of biases and how they were out of touch and wrong, even for the 1970s."
Americas Next Top Model,"Before I opened the thread, I tried to imagine the most wrongheaded answer to this question, and it was All In The Family. I should go buy a lottery ticket."
Americas Next Top Model,Entourage. It’s so aggressively mid 2000s
Americas Next Top Model,All in the family definitely could be made today. You’re not supposed to like Archie. He’s showing the absurdity of the times. Today it would be Q folk and conspiracy theorist is who would be hated — anti Vaxers etc. you have to note the era and the message being portrayed.
Americas Next Top Model,I would say that there's no reality TV that ages well whatsoever.  It's almost entirely garbage when it's new.
Americas Next Top Model,"Hogan's Heroes -- I still struggle to comprehend how a screwball comedy set in a Nazi POW camp was a thing *then.*

Pretty much every 80's sitcom."
Americas Next Top Model,"Manswers, or anything from the Spike Tv era in 2003-2006"
Americas Next Top Model,"As much as I love 24, I would say it has not aged well in two ways. First, the mentality of breaking the rules for the “greater good” and torturing to get the information you need was more accepted back when it first aired. It was definitely a “post-9/11” show in how it treated those topics. 

But the bigger reason why it has aged poorly is the size of each season. People were more accustomed to long seasons back then. These days 10-12 episode seasons are the norm for “good” tv shows. 24 42-minute episodes is soooo much content. I just rewatched season 1, and while it is still really enjoyable there are whole subplots that are unnecessary."
Americas Next Top Model,"80s action shows:
The hulk
Knight Rider
A team"
Americas Next Top Model,Jim'll Fix It
Americas Next Top Model,Saved by the bell is unwatchable
Americas Next Top Model,"All in the Family changed the way people think. If it was never made, those attitudes would be more prevalent. 

It is not a product of its time. Our time is a product of it."
Americas Next Top Model,"The Man Show

While this show isn’t _as_ misogynistic as I remember, a lot of jokes and bits don’t hold up. And the blackface would probably have audience members walking out just so they don’t end up on YouTube clips."
Americas Next Top Model,"I have a hard time with any show that had a laugh track. Even though I absolutely loved shows like Full House, and Home Improvement when I was a kid, I can't help but get irritated if I try to rewatch them now.

Edit: But if you meant aged badly for the content, I absolutely couldn't see Ren & Stimpy being allowed, nowadays. XD"
Americas Next Top Model,"Growing Pains - star went from heart throb to nutjob. sad thing, it's actually pretty funny for family sitcom."
Americas Next Top Model,"1) The Cosby Show

2) SNL in the early 80s - The Doumanian and Ebersol years are loaded with a great deal of yellow-face and black-face, and fat girl jokes, and racism, misogyny, and homophobia… it’s actually kinda crazy.

3) The Apprentice"
Americas Next Top Model,"The West Wing

It has become clear that it is not reflective at all about how Washington works, and is just how Sorkin wished things worked."
Americas Next Top Model,"In Living Color. Tried watching it again recently. It...does not hold up.

Mr. Show also.

Cosby Show. Even if Cosby wasn't a monster, that show didn't hold up."
Americas Next Top Model,The Morning Show
Americas Next Top Model,"I'm really picky, so I haven't really watched many shows that age poorly. Just shows that can't come up with a good ending and bomb out lol"
Americas Next Top Model,"Another thing about All in the family is that it's a product of its time. Yes, there are things in it that are politically incorrect. But that was the time and I don't agree it doesn't age well."
Americas Next Top Model,"They're literally still making All in the Family now about the 70s lol, it's called F is for Family."
Americas Next Top Model,i don’t see network television picking up a show like that nowadays. i don’t think they’d put out a show which had all kinds of discrimination. Netflix doesn’t count IMO because Netflix wasn’t around back then but Netflix would allow a show like that to go there and explore that world.
Americas Next Top Model,"Competition reality shows age fine.  Other than growing pains in the early seasons as they figure things out, early seasons of Amazing Race and Survivor still hold up and are entertaining.  I'm not sure it is fair to comment on how well something holds up if you didn't like it in the first place."
Americas Next Top Model,Survivor
Americas Next Top Model,"i think the Simple Life still holds up, especially now that Paris has admitted to playing a character and it was staged."
Americas Next Top Model,">I just rewatched season 1, and while it is still really enjoyable there are whole subplots that are unnecessary.

I mean even when it was airing it got mocked for pointless subplots that went nowhere. It even spawned the phrase ""trapped by mountain lions."""
Americas Next Top Model,[deleted]
Americas Next Top Model,i agree with the laughing tracks. classics IE I Love Lucy was authentically funny so didn’t need a track & it feeeels so much more organic. i feel like a lot of cartoons from that era IE Cow and Chicken wouldn’t be allowed either and i absolutely love those shows as well. but i do agree with u 100%
Americas Next Top Model,"I have to agree with you, I have often I wondered if there was an event in his life that made him change?"
Americas Next Top Model,But that’s ok. TV shows aren’t real.
Americas Next Top Model,I will fight you
Americas Next Top Model,Mr. Show doesn’t hold up for you?  How come?  What’s different for you upon rewatching?
Americas Next Top Model,New episodes are coming here soon. I’m stoked.
Americas Next Top Model,"You have to look at the times. He was showing how absurd the arguments were that are for the time. Again, he’s not supposed to be liked. It turned out he was liked. Much like The kids from South Park (especially Eric). Gays and blacks, etc are accepted today but conservatives and anti-vaxers aren’t. The narrative would need updated but the substance would still be there. 50 years from now, if it were made today, you never know. There are shows on now that in 50 years young adults will be posting that they can’t be made “today”

What is discrimination yesterday isn’t necessarily the same thing today. Antivaxers would be the big one today. He could be a guy that god vaccinated complaining about those that don’t. The narrative would shift. That’s just an example"
Americas Next Top Model,Have you seen The Neighborhood with Cedric the Entertainer?  He's basically Archie Bunker with Max Greenfield and Beth Behrs as the Jeffersons next door.  Also.... not a good show.
Americas Next Top Model,Survivor is so anthropological. I love that aspect of it.
Americas Next Top Model,"Nahh it was a shitty low quality sausage, and it's not redeemed by finding out how many anuses and lips went into making it."
Americas Next Top Model,"Not only was it mocked, the show runners almost bailed on the real time aspect because they were having trouble filling out the story. That’s why they started giving Kim more stories."
Americas Next Top Model,"It'll be interesting to see the reboot, and compare to the original, for sure!

I'll have to take your word on Animaniacs, though. For some reason, I just never saw those as a kid, but I have seen some compelling clips."
Americas Next Top Model,"Animaniacs did some risque jokes in the 90s version too. 

That fingerprints joke they got away with on a kids show shocked the hell out of me."
Americas Next Top Model,"I actually did consider I Love Lucy when I wrote that, and I couldn't bring myself to include it in the lineup, because I still genuinely adore it. It feels like you're laughing 'with' them, and not just like a cue saying ""laugh here"". XD I think you're right on with that assessment."
Americas Next Top Model,"From what I understand it all stemmed from something not too dissimilar to other child actors.
Simply put they were made to do things by certain people that will continue to haunt them. What better rejection of all that than to embrace its diametric opposite?"
Americas Next Top Model,"He started going psycho during the show.  He had them fire the actress who played his girlfriend/fiance after it came out that she had posed for nude photos.  Several of the producers quit because he was calling the head of the network and accusing them of being pornographers because of the ""inappropriate"" stories he felt they were trying to put in the show.  He started ignoring the rest of the cast and not inviting them to anything he did (holiday parties, birthday parties, etc...)  He even refused to invite any of them to his wedding during the show.  He turned into a total douche."
Americas Next Top Model,"That show killed me when it first ran. Going back to it, it just doesn't. I don't know exactly. It just doesn't seem good to me. All of the people involved are mostly still working and are incredibly talented and at the time, that show was amazing. Just for me doesn't hold up."
Americas Next Top Model,with the different plot i get it. an Archie or the 21st century.
Americas Next Top Model,"The Neighborhood is weird, like it's not great at all, but I still like it a lot for some reason. It's super corny."
Americas Next Top Model,lmao i think it’s still funny as hell!
Americas Next Top Model,"Wow really? I had no idea it was so bad, but it makes so much sense."
Americas Next Top Model,yeah ur right it does feel they made the audience-im intentionally or unintentionally- feel like we’re having a fun time with old friends
Americas Next Top Model,"Do you have a source for any of this?  Not that I don’t believe you, I’d just like to read it."
Americas Next Top Model,"I watched it a few times before I cancelled my cable, just because Max Greenfield.  It wasn't awful, but was definitely a show you could have on without needing to devote your full attention to it while doing something else."
Americas Next Top Model,The Witcher was alright and isn't a long series so maybe you can try that. It's quite episodic so you won't need to binge it.
Americas Next Top Model,"Wizard of Oz, & Easter Parade. Wizard is one of my favorites, & Easter Parade was one of my mum's. So I'll watch for her. Then probably Alien since I need to balance one favorite out with another favorite."
Americas Next Top Model,"We're pagan so we won't be watching anything about the holiday itself. I'd like to start ""Young Rock"" at some point so we might put that on. I recently stumbled upon History Channel's ""The Food That Built America"" so we might binge on that since Easter is kind of a food-emphasized day. Other than that, we'll probably tune into Hallmark movies for a good part of the day."
Americas Next Top Model,Probably a church livestream
Americas Next Top Model,Charlie Brown has an Easter special that’s pretty cute. Otherwise I will watch The Prince of Egypt because my gf is Jewish and Passover is around the same time haha.
Americas Next Top Model,Sounds super eventful
Americas Next Top Model,"I know it's messy right now, I'm updating the format and trying to squeeze in as much info as I can. Any help finding sources would be much appreciated. =)"

Americas Next Top Model,Breaking Bad comes back August 11
Americas Next Top Model,"I really hope Go On gets renewed. I know I'll be hated for this, but it reminds me of Community, but better. I like Community, especially the first three seasons, but it's gotten way too self referential and meta. Go On reminds me of early Community, and hopefully we get more of it."
Americas Next Top Model,"Mad Men is ending in it's seventh season, not the 6th if I recall."
Americas Next Top Model,Community is on the uncertain renewal twice 
Americas Next Top Model,"Mad Men is currently airing its sixth season in the summer, not in the fall, and I'm pretty certain that the series finale will take place in season 7, not season 6. "

Arrow,Who could forget the incredible slap fight between Arrow & Damien Darhk at the end of season 4.
Arrow,"[Ah yes, who could forget those incredible fight sequences.](https://abload.de/img/flip9nyo3.gif)"
Arrow,"Season 1/2 or season 3-8?

Because there is a hell of a difference"
Arrow,I can't remember a single fight scene in the 4 increasingly bad seasons I watched.
Arrow,"Green Arrow as a show was ruined the moment they made Oliver stop killing people. You can't have a superhero bow and arrow shooter who doesn't shoot people with his bow and arrow. He ended up slapping people with the bow more than he shot people. Like Donatello with a worse stick.

It'd be like if John Wick used his pistol as a mallet for an entire movie."
Arrow,I'll only come back for the salmon ladder
Arrow,"The quotation marks around ""incredible fight sequences"" are great lol 

They were so bad"
Arrow,will it pay homage to flashes bad...fight scenes?
Arrow,will they stand around at the end of the episode posing while the enemy walks away!
Arrow,Both of these shows are ass.
Arrow,"I am not sure why, but I find every DC comics based shows to be hokey. Anyone know how they manage to make them all hokey?"
Arrow,Aka fistfight instead of shooting arrows
Arrow,Or when they decided to >!make Darhk kill Laurel in the most pathetic way possible so the writers could remove any obstacles between Oliver/Felicity getting together!<. The ‘Olicity’ shippers were an absolute curse for the show.
Arrow,"Ironically enough season 4 had great fight scenes, especially one in the first half. I have no idea what they were thinking."
Arrow,"https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/4l6cve/s4e23_an_excelent_portrayal_of_the_fighting/

Season 3 and 4 of Arrow was my favourite time on Reddit lol"
Arrow,I can't stop watching this. Holy shit
Arrow,Lol I'd love to know the sequence of decisions that led to this making it to air.
Arrow,Parkour!
Arrow,Dude with the knife sure showed atmosphere who's boss.
Arrow,did they forget to CG in a rail for him to hop over?
Arrow,"3 was still fine

and 5 was amazing"
Arrow,"Yeah they recognized they fucked up after season 4 and really did well for the fights following it. I get that this sub loves to meme that show, but they did much better."
Arrow,"honestly rewatching season 1, the fight scenes were often painfully bad, with amel whipping at air.

Every season has its up and downs"
Arrow,Seasons 3 to 8 had plenty of great fight sequences.
Arrow,"Oliver vs Slade in the S2 finale is great - the way they intercut between them fighting in present with the past. 

Sucks the show dropped off quite a bit after that (although S5 is really good as the villain is great) but it was a fun show for a few years."
Arrow,Okay but how could you forget Roy's flips?
Arrow,"There were good fight scenes, but the problem is there's maybe 5 good ones over the course of the whole show, and there's usually at least 2 /awful or forgettable fight scenes per episode."
Arrow,"Funnily enough, the only one that popped in my head was the one in the season 5 premiere. If I remember correctly, they had one of the stunt guys direct that episode."
Arrow,Shame you stopped there. Season 5 was really good.
Arrow,The [oliver vs ra's al ghul fight](https://youtu.be/mUAPBuOBwag) was pretty great. It was bold of the to end the series there instead running it into the ground
Arrow,"I'm watching the show right now (on season 3, saw the first 2 seasons back in the day and wanted something mindless to watch before going to sleep) and it's so funny to me that every other character in the show is frustrated and annoyed at him for not killing, even Felicity, who wouldn't stop giving him grief for it back in season 1."
Arrow,"Some of them were sure, but a lot weren't. Arrow had great fight scenes."
Arrow,"That whole relationship arc was incredibly stupid and took up far too much screen time.

Felicity spends like 2 seasons trying to convince Oliver they should be together, he only accepts when he tries to retire from fighting, she then BRINGS HIM BACK to being the Green Arrow only to then admit they can't be together like this and breaks up with him. She also then acts as if nothing is wrong a day later and gets pissy with him for being upset. 

They honestly made her into a *terrible* person. If they wanted to cram in some relationship drama so bad they could have stuck Oliver and Laurel together. At least their issues normally had some logical reasoning behind.

Edit: AND ANOTHER THING, After she dumps Oliver she keeps the huge apartment they stay in even though it belongs to HIS SISTER"
Arrow,"Holy shit I had erased olicity from my brain

The most toxic shipping fan base in the world"
Arrow,Oliver and felicity were already a thing by the time laurel was killed.
Arrow,"That episode where Oliver was told if he told Felicity about his son he'd never get to see the child again and when Felicity finds out, she uncrippled herself and walked out... that was the worst thing i'd ever seen on TV."
Arrow,"losing willa ford and  Coltan hanes was a blow, they played up dark being a member of the league quite a bit. Too much for the actor to handle"
Arrow,i answered a 7 year old question in that thread by accident damnit
Arrow,Season 7A and season 8 were also amazing
Arrow,"It's kinda like walking dead, in that they both got better but most people on here gave up when they got really bad and that's the last impression they got so that's how they see the rest of the run"
Arrow,">  the way they intercut between them fighting in present with the past.

They did this again in Season 5 and it was absolutely superb. 

Honestly the whole flashback thing was always so well done from the small things like the cuts focusing on an object or shape that carries over to the next shot or how plot points naturally occur in both times."
Arrow,"Gave up after 3 seasons , who was the season 5 villian ?"
Arrow,James Bamford?
Arrow,"Can’t blame em. Season 3 was a huge let down, and Season 4 was hot garbage. 5 was a great return to form, but I wouldn’t recommend people push past 3 for it at this point."
Arrow,"That was the worse part about the show. All of his allies are against him on something, and at the end of the episode he learns he needs to change. Oliver is never allowed to be right. They repeat the same arguments with the positions flipped but Oliver always learns by the end of the episode he needs to change.   
  
It doesn’t make for a very inspiring hero."
Arrow,Don’t forget that Felicity nuked a city and they brought in a character who used magic to survive the blast just to forgive her.
Arrow,"God, I thought I drank away all memories of this."
Arrow,"Man how could you get that deep in the weeds without mentioning her paralysis arc? 

She gets paralyzed from the waist down (I don't remember how or why, doesn't matter either) and later gets cured, and reveals this during her breakup with Oliver by *literally walking out of his life.*  It's so fucking stupid.

Olicity was a malignant tumor on an otherwise decent CW show. I threw in the towel after four seasons."
Arrow,"Alright I might get crucified here

But I don't think season 4 was hurt by Felicty.

I think season 4 was hurt by 2 things

1) It was a bit divided trying to set up a bunch of other properties, Legends, Vixen, Constantine etc

2) Damian was promised as something scarier than Ra's, and as a villain he never hit that mark."
Arrow,"> Season 7A

I hope your not including the bit where Oliver reads someone their Miranda rights, and they become cops."
Arrow,">	how plot points naturally occur in both times.

They did thus pretty well but it gets less and less believable that he’s dealing with these plot points in the same order 5 years apart."
Arrow,Prometheus but not very linked to comic books. The actor they got is just terrific.
Arrow,"Adrian Chase... but as Prometheus, not Vigilante (who they made as some other character).  
And Dolph Lundgren in the flashbacks."
Arrow,"Okay, heres the deal.

I thought actually playing out the trolley problem was kinda genius. At least on Paper. It could gave been brilliant. Sometimes you can't prevent a horrible thing, you can only try to mitigate it.

And the moral quandary of whether you pull the leaver to save the lives of 10 people at the expense of 1, is a fundemental thought experiment in moral philosophy. Objectively, she saved *Millions* of lives in that moment. Arguably more than most of the vigilantes do in Arrowverse (well, until you start getting cosmic, planet killing threats etc).

- Imagine if they went to an Earth where Felciity didn't make that choice. We would see Felciity meet a version of herself who *could* have saved millions but chose not to. Let them argue the point. Who was right. Who wasnt.

- Actually visit the Ruins of the Rockhaven. Have there be direct consequences to a *Nuclear Blast* on American soil. Major consequences for the Rubucon ever existing. It was *technically* a Russian missle, and the Russian Mob was a major part of future seasons. Maybe it might have been interesting to see the world become a little more *tense* as a result of Dharks actions.

- Season 4 of Arrow coincides with Season 2; of the Flash: but Season 5 where the fallout of this Season would be explored coincides with Season 3 of the Flash and Flashpoint. The Whole shebang about living with your mistakes and not being able to easilly fix the past. You could have had Flashpoint restore Rockhaven; but with Felcity still haunted by what she did and not being able to tell if it was the right decision or not: or even have her try to get Barry to change the Timeline. Barry would refuse of course, but more than that ""Do you really expect me to change the Timeline to make sure that Millions of people die? And you think that will assuage your conscience?"" Imagine asking someone to go back in time and stop you from Saving millions of lives.

You can't say it wasn't shocking. I just wish they'd done something with it and given it more of a resolution than Rory forgiving her. The focus should have been on *Her* and whether or not she could live with herself. She made the decision to let thousands of people die in order to save millions. By plenty of moral frameworks she made the right call, but there is no philosophical consensus. That's a *ludicrously* rich vein of drama; and much better than what happened.

I don't think Season 4 was as bad as it's often toughted to be: it just needed follow through. It also made the *really* foolish decision of introducing magic straight of the bat as their first Metahuman enemy. I know they'd kinda introduced some of the more mystical elements with the Lazarus Pits, but it was still a huge tonal jump. They should have just introduced a regular metahuman, imported from Central City, and stress that the Arrow Team aren't really equipped to handle Metahumans. Supersoliders are one thing but a guy who can throw fire? Fly? Walk through walls? Much harder.

Then, you add magic in like season 6 or 7, when they've taken down Metas, are much more confident in their abilities that they can handle the extraordinary. That makes the lunacy that is dealing with genuine Dark magic much harder to deal with."
Arrow,And she killed a villian of the week with a lamp
Arrow,"You'll need to drink more when you remember her paralysis healing implant starts working at the exact moment she breaks up with him so she can literally walk out on him. 

Purely because she got mad at him for not telling her he was making his recently discovered son go into hiding away from him because he was literally just kidnapped. God damn I hated her that season."
Arrow,"On Damian, I think that’s why the general consensus on him is that he’s so much better handled past that point, because they didn’t try to set him up as this huge, scary threat, and they wroked around what he really was."
Arrow,">Damian was promised as something scarier than Ra's, and as a villain he never hit that mark.

The biggest problem is his actor. The guy has acting chops on par with Steven Seagal. The guy was supposed to be evil and menacing but I've seen 5th graders with a more intimidating presence than him."
Arrow,"Damian didnt make sense. With his over whelming, poorly defined powers"
Arrow,I looked him up there and I remember him from She Hulk
Arrow,I can't for the life of me understand how he isn't doing more things. He's been excellent in everything I've seen him.
Arrow,"This is now a daredevil thread, no more Olicity. How about them avocados at law"
Arrow,"Please. I can't handle any more, the trauma is resurfacing."
Arrow,Please no more I beg you.
Arrow,That was one of the best scenes in TV history. I can’t believe I forgot about that.
Arrow,">You'll need to drink more when you remember her paralysis healing implant starts working at the exact moment she breaks up with him so she can literally walk out on him.   

This was what they decided on for a midseason cliffhanger too.  The show completely forgot what people liked about it and just pandered to shipping drama bullshit."
Arrow,Yeah I think I skipped that arc. I couldn't finish the show even though I really like Stephen Amell (not saying he's a great actor).
Arrow,"a magical villain does better with a magical arc

and he makes a better Dad than a cult leader"
Arrow,He was a lot better in Legends where he got to me more comedic. He fit the tone there really well.
Arrow,"I would want to see more of his other work before fully casting judgement.

but for now I have to blame the writing more than the actor. Even later on in the Arrowverse...after season 5 of Arrow  / season 2 of Legends / Season 3 of Flash...once he was given some real motivation, he is more intimidating."
Arrow,He was pretty good in season 3 of justified
Arrow,Were.
Arrow,Arrow season 1 and season 2 are actually really great television. Both seasons have insanely captivating villains which is the thing that makes them so great. The story overall is also just really interesting and the flashbacks were really good in those seasons.
Arrow,Legends of Tomorrow was the most fun of all the Arrowverse.
Arrow,I think season 2 was pretty great. Excellent villain and a great climax when he >!kills Oliver's mom.!<
Arrow,"Arrow had its ups and downs, but it’s the only show I watched through to the end. The Flash began declining after season 1 but I couldn’t take it by season 7"
Arrow,"I think they're decent. They don't stand up particularly well in an age of streaming prestige TV - they have about twice as many episodes as they can really support. Of the two, I think Arrow is generally the stronger show.

But I'd probably put them both a notch below Smallville."
Arrow,"Arrow is actually not as bad as many people think. Sure the bad is bad but if you're watching it and it's bad, doesn't matter at which point in the series you are, there will be good stuff later on. Seasons 1, 2, 3A, 4 (until episode 15 or sth), 5, 6 (after episode 15 or so), 7A and 8 all range from decent to great television. Like 7A was one of the better storylines they've done and the final season was pretty damn great. But yeah you have to go through a lot of shit in the process I can't deny that."
Arrow,"Aside from all that Felicity shenanigans, part of the reason I dropped Arrow was the introduction of meta humans. 

It started as this very grounded super hero story. I loved it until season 2 but the Barry Allen episodes already got me cautious."
Arrow,Arrow isnt good if you got into it expecting a Green Arrow adaptation. Call him Young Batarrow if you d ont want to do Green Arrow
Arrow,Arrow was good until it became the Felicity crying show.
Arrow,"season 1,2 ,5  of arrow where legit good

Flash only had season 1 and 2 of being good"
Arrow,Oliver Queen went from a badass batman type killing a guy just because he learned about his secret identity to a betacuck. The Flash went from peak comic to defeating bad guys with the power of love and positive thinking. I don't know how they fucked it up so much.
Arrow,"Couldn't agree more. 3&4 were a bit of a mess, but since 5 everything went downhill. Flash was only good in season 1 and a bit in season 2. All other seasons are crap."
Arrow,Agreed.
Arrow,"How can you watch it after that Damien Darhk final arc, Fully armed goons brawling with normal citizens. I dropped it immediately afterwards. It's the straw that broke the camels back."
Arrow,"I feel like I remember them saying all over the place when Arrow started that there wasn't going to be any Batman and there wouldn't be any actual superpowers.

That's why when The Flash was starting they tried SO hard to make that a plausible result of some scientific something and then they just completely ran away from the earlier promise of that grounded setting."
Arrow,But they rebounded in a huge way with season 5. One of the best seasons of the whole series
Arrow,Fez and Jackie in that 70’s show
Arrow,"Haley and Dylan from Modern Family. They dumped the character development on both sides, and focused on making them a young Claire and Phil. I still wish Haley and Andy got together.

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: Glad I’m not the only one who feels this way."
Arrow,I wouldn't have minded the ending to HIMYM as much if the whole last season wasn't the goddamn wedding and the whole focus on him letting Robin go.
Arrow,Emma and Spinner on Degrassi. What a choice that was
Arrow,"Whoever the random, faceless, human man Sookie Stackhouse ends up with at the end of True Blood. Lets erase the entire show's concept of a human in love with a vampire so that she can end up pregnant. 

cool cool cool. Thanks HBO who has no reputation for ruining tv shows with terrible endings ever. /s"
Arrow,"Any couple where they have one character date multiple people within a friend group in a relatively short time span and everyone still just hangs out like it’s not weird or like it wouldn’t be uncomfortable to do that right away. Treats the character like a plot device, not a person. Just don’t like it.

Jackie and Fez on That 70’s Show is an egregious example."
Arrow,"Everyone they tried to fix Erin up with on The Office was creepy and weird. She was so childlike it just felt like whoever they put her with was taking advantage of her to varying degrees.

Ellie Kemper played basically the same character on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but they managed to put her in multiple relationships that made sense for her character. (Not counting Jon Hamm who was weird and creepy on purpose)"
Arrow,Chakotay and seven of nine
Arrow,"It didn't make me furious, but Reese and Carter from Person of Interest was odd.

Yeah, they had a good working relationship, dare say friends, but there was never a hint of romance."
Arrow,Can always pretend the cut alternate ending is the real one for HIMYM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5toL5HmQl8I
Arrow,In Gilmore Girls- Lane and Zach
Arrow,"Jaime and Cersei Lannister. The character assassination for Jaime to go back to her after so much development that I was actually rooting for him, and it was made even worse by leaving Brienne like he did. Ugh."

Avatar: The Last Airbender,Interested to see how Bumi is portrayed with Utkarsh playing him
Hi-5,"Depends on the length of each episode. 

For example, I wasn’t in love with Our Flag Means Death first few episodes. But it was quirky enough that I kept going. Because they were 30 min episodes it was easy to see if I would get interested. Eventually I really liked it. 

With 45min-1 hour long episodes. I’d say 3 episodes tops."
Hi-5,"Three episodes.

Here's why: episode one is usually the pilot. This is how they sell the show and introduces way too much way too fast. Nothing is fleshed out except maybe one or two story points.

Which makes episode three when things really start. Still too early to see how all the pieces move and interactions are flowing.

So by the end of episode three, if I'm not interested in the plot, the characters, or the premise, it's time to move on. I don't watch television for Stockholm Syndrome. If you don't grab me in the first 90/180 minutes you missed your shot."
Hi-5,"I watch the pilot, If i like it, I go on...

If i didn't, I try a couple more, that's it, not more..."
Hi-5,"It completely depends on the show, and what the consensus opinion is of when it becomes ""good"". For example, the 1st season of Black Sails is widely considered mediocre at best, but the rest of the show is considered to have a vastly improved quality to it. I knew all of this before starting it, so I knew I couldn't fairly judge it until watching all of Season 1 and most or all of Season 2. 

Shows can evolve fairly dramatically in as little as 1 season, so I think it's unfair to write a show off quickly (unless the consensus opinion is that the first few episodes/first season is really good but you still don't enjoy it)."
Hi-5,"2-5 episodes. If you just at least hold semi interest for me, I can keep on going."
Hi-5,The show needs to hook me with the pilot.
Hi-5,"Depends on if the show is actually bad, or just not to my taste.
If it´s bad you usually spot it during the first episode, bad script, stiff acting, etc, in those cases you check out the next one and if it´s no improving then you´re done. But if ita show just not to my taste,  it´s much quicker process, those show´s you sometime turn off as little as 10-15 minutes in."
Hi-5,"After an entire season? I think you're well within your rights to decide that you don't like it.

I give it a few episodes at most. If the first episode is utterly unwatchable I'll drop it there and then."
Hi-5,"For a comedy 8-10. It usually takes a comedy some time to get its footing. I can tell earlier if I dont like it but need a good number to determine if I like it enough to keep watching.

For a drama, 2 episodes. Usually the pilot is one of the best episodes and then episode 2 is more in line with what the show will be episode to episode. If Im not hooked by the end of episode 2, they lost me."
Hi-5,"I see a lot of people saying 3, but 3 is really not quite enough to my mind. You really can't get a hold of the characters in 3 episodes. 5. 5 is enough. You've given it the full chance there. 1 whole season? More than enough.

\*Just as an example, many people didn't get into The Expanse if they only watched up to ep 3, but those that pushed through to the 5th episode then became mega-fans."
Hi-5,"Depends on episode count and runtime.

I'd say like half a season minimum, but depends on if it's a show that apparently has a weaker start but get's better at some point, I'll at least watch up to there. Probably not more than a season and a half."
Hi-5,"I always give a show a minimum of 2-3 episodes to find its footing. Pilots tend to be clunky and exposition heavy and the actors often haven’t gelled yet, so I make sure to watch past the pilot."
Hi-5,"1 full hour episode if the genre is drama

Example shows that hooked me from the first episode:

Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, The Wire"
Hi-5,"This might sound absolutely insane, but I watch an entire series before deciding whether or not I like it."
Hi-5,"Takes about 3 for me to decide if I'm into it. However, even if I like it or not, I tend to stick it out to the end. Same with books."
Hi-5,"If I intend to be fair to the show, I give it like 5 half-hour episodes, or maybe 3 hour-long episodes. I think it's important to acknowledge that pilots *very* often have a different vibe than the rest of the show, and it usually takes a couple episodes past that for a show to get going.

I think it's also really important to keep in mind what the fans of the show have to say about it. I know people roll their eyes when fans are like ""just push through the first five episodes, I promise it gets good after that!"" but like... that's real. I'm sure we are all fans of at least one show with a rocky start. If we all immediately stopped watching shows whenever we encountered a rough beginning, then we never would have had all such all-time classics as Star Trek TNG, Seinfeld, The Office, and Parks & Recreation. So how do we tell the difference between a show with a rough start and a show that is rough all the way through? Duh, we listen to people who *also* found the beginning rough, but pushed through it and discovered that it became a great show. Those people are the experts, and we can trust them.

That said, personally, I won't force myself to watch something I'm not enjoying. I do this without judgment, though! The example currently coming to mind is The Expanse. I watched the first episode and found it boring. I *know* that The Expanse is one of those shows with a rocky start, and I know I need to watch more if I want to actually have a fair opinion it. So I stopped watching it, but it's more ""on pause"" in my mind than completely dropped. I imagine I'll circle back to it eventually, but I'm going to have to be in the right mood to push through to where I can actually judge the show. Until then, no judgments from me."
Hi-5,"I start with the second episode (since the pilot can be very different) and watch 10 minutes.  If I don't like anything about it, I give up.  If I kind off like it I watch the rest of the episode.

There are too many things I enjoy watching for me to watching something I don't like for hours on the chance that I will eventually like it.  The show is there for my benefit, I'm not there for the show's benefit."
Hi-5,"It varies for me.  But overall, I will say that 2-5 episodes.  
The first episode/pilot is rarely a good gauge for the rest of the show, but the next 4 episodes should show you something.  Something you like within the show, early on that peaks your interest.  It doesn't have to be finished product, but you see nuggets/cores of a interesting characters.  
*Parks and Rec* is a great example of the 2-5 episodes.  Even in season 1, the characters are not fully developed, but you can see the main ""staples"" of their personalities."
Hi-5,"if the premise ain't for me I skip it entirely, even if it's 100% on RT. For those I do watch, two episodes are enough"
Hi-5,"2-3 episodes normally. Some shows have a slow start so maybe take a look at the imdb ratings. In your case, 50% of the show (30 episodes) is more then enough"
Hi-5,I used to need a season now all i need to see is the trailer and a plot synopsis.
Hi-5,"The pilot is there to grab you, it is the duty of the writer, director, actor, show runner, studios to put something in front of you that grabs you and convinces you that you should watch more. True there are shows that develop over time and may change to be more to your likening, but that is really a failure on the makers of the show. You should feel no responsibility past that first full episode."
Hi-5,I’m loving the feedback. Please keep it coming everyone.
Hi-5,Thanks so much for all of the feedback everyone. Much appreciated.
Hi-5,"The 10 minute rule. It doesn’t have to be the greatest thing ever by that point but that’s enough to judge & decide to bail/continue.

If something gets good *enough* that word-of-mouth suggests considering giving it another go, then great. *Chef* on Netflix is a great example, albeit non-fiction - excellent show, but anyone could be forgiven for viewing episode 1 & not wanting a minute more.

IMO, if a show ‘needs’ excessive time to get into it, then that’s a flaw of the art."
Hi-5,Three max.
Hi-5,"I think it really depends on the type of show & circumstances of the show. Like The Office was created based off the UK show of the same name & they copied that format for 2 seasons. Some people don’t like these seasons, but they love the show after that. 

As a general statement, I would say 2-5 episodes, but keep the type of show and it’s circumstances in mind."
Hi-5,"Very rarely does a series get better after a dull first season. The only example I can think of is Parks and Recreation, and it took years for people to convince me to try that one again. Generally, if a show doesn’t rope me in by the third episode, I’m moving on."
Hi-5,One or two episodes
Hi-5,"Depends on the era. 

Today I am too cynical as they all are in the business of treating people like lab rats to keep them coming back."
Hi-5,3 episodes.
Hi-5,"1-3. First episode has to hook me big time or even just a little. Episode 2, I wanna see where this goes. Episode 3 is the last chance, if I don't see something rewarding me for paying attention or a character whose story they managed to make me care about, I'm out.

Too little time, and a lot of good shows out there. I don't usually waste my time on a whole season of a show before I decide I like it these days."
Hi-5,"I give it 2 or 3 episodes.  Pilots can be a mess of exposition, setting things up, actors finding their footing with the characters, studio interference, etc. 

I try to look past the rough spots there and see how the next couple of episodes do."
Hi-5,"One episode for dramas, at least three if it's comedy."
Hi-5,i think you can say you don't like something after 1 episode. But if you want to judge it as being a bad show i think the whole first season is enough.
Hi-5,"Depends on the show and if it’s a new show or old.  New show just airing 3-6. Old show that get better, watch until it gets better."
Hi-5,"Depends on the show. Some shows changed a lot over their runs--a show you liked in the first season, you might dislike in the second or vice versa."
Hi-5,"Half the first season usually, though sometimes I've got halfway through the first ep and realised it just ain't for me. I've never regretted pulling the plug on a show"
Hi-5,"Depends on the number of seasons and level of critical acclaim. 

If a show has *tons* of acclaim but is new to the pallate, I'll give it one season - especially if the episodes are only 30minutes long. 

For shows with an episode an hour long or more, 3 episodes is the cut off."
Hi-5,"Provided the show is to my taste (aesthetically/subject matter/concept) then I will try to give it until the first episode of the 2nd season.

Black Sails taught me this. It is my favourite show ever but the first time through, Season 1 was a slog. From season 2 episode 1 onward it is a nearly perfect show. Because of Black Sails I will always try to give shows one season + 1, just in case I get that experience again."
Hi-5,"Depends on the show. Dramas, usually 4-5 episodes. Comedies can take a whole season or more. But the great thing there is if you do end up getting into it, you can rewatch and enjoy the beginning part more the second time around."
Hi-5,"25% of a series, capped at 25 episodes for a series of 100 episodes or more for first impressions. Entire series for fair criticism."
Hi-5,For clarification I meant standard 22 min episodes. So fewer episodes if they were longer. Good point by you.
Hi-5,"I think the normal thing is the 4 episode test. You've got the pilot which was filmed way before actual production starts, then episode 2 usually restates the point of the show and is the first of the full run, episodes 3 & 4 are when things start pulling together.

Although that's not a hard and fast rule, some shows (which mercifully I've blanked from my memory) I couldn't make it through the pilot. No way I was inflicting another 3 episodes on myself to get to the test."
Hi-5,I like the justification. That’s how I see it too. You need to hook me in the first couple of episodes.
Hi-5,"Black sails season 1 is not mediocre, the fans are just weird. The first season is still good, it's just slow compared to the rest of the series and a lot of people dont like slow at all, especially when it comes to pirates."
Hi-5,"I have to agree with the other comments,  sure s1 of black sails is a little slower, but that show is fucking great the whole way through."
Hi-5,Black Sails S1 is amazing though. But the show gets better and better every season similar to what happens with Breaking Bad.
Hi-5,That’s kind of how I feel as well.
Hi-5,"I agree with this take.  

Never more than two episodes.  But almost always I can tell on one episode."
Hi-5,It’s up to you how to watch TV so if that’s how you like it no problem. My only question would be how do you decide what to watch? Because it seems like it would be difficult to be discerning if you have to finish everything you start to make any judgements. Unless I have misunderstood your meaning?
Hi-5,[Is this you??](https://i.redd.it/aejyd17n8po21.png)
Hi-5,"I am the same, and I know it's crazy. haha I have only quit 2 shows in my life, and I am even debating going back to finish those now that they are over."
Hi-5,"Do you just enjoy misery, or what is the point in wasting life going through books and shows that u don't even care for?"
Hi-5,Trailers now in days are not a good indication of if a show will be good. I've enjoyed shows that had horrendous trailers and hate shows whose trailers I liked.
Hi-5,[deleted]
Hi-5,Yeah Seinfeld is one for me that clearly gets better as it goes along. But I agree it’s pretty rare for the first season to be bad and it get better. Probably to some degree since the bad shows get dropped often before a second season.
Hi-5,"This is absolutely false, especially for network shows."
Hi-5,"Star Trek TNG is pretty famously another example, as are The Office and Seinfeld."
Hi-5,Bojack
Hi-5,"Imo, Parks and Recreation was saved by the final episode of Season 1 (The Rock Show)

There's also shows like Seinfeld and The Office where it got better in the second season."
Hi-5,"I'm late to this, but I feel like 22-min is the standard for a cable-run comedy, so your question is limited to that genre.  Which really changes the nature of it entirely.

I guess it's already been said but by genre is probably best.  Can't conflate 65-min long HBO dramas with half hour comedies with ads.

Also what about cable-run vs network PPV?  I mean we're talking about an additional 10-min per episode for half hour shows, and closer to 20-min more for dramas.  (Fuck cable television though, I cannot stand the need for writer's to have a goddamn cliffhanging scene every single time they cut for commercial)"
Hi-5,"Episode 4 for me is like an appeal.  

Like if I'm pretty sure I don't like a show but _do_ enjoy singular aspects of it like a character or a running joke,  I'm willing to give it one more episode."
Hi-5,"I think it's a combination of being good at guessing what I'm gonna like and the fact that I'm not super critical.  I always find something about a show to like.  I joke that I get stockholm syndrome from a show I've spent enough time with.  Even if a show is off to a rocky start, it tends to grow on me after a few episodes.  No show is perfect, so I'm not deterred by a few bad episodes, or even seasons.  I like to find out what happens.  Some shows do get better, some shows continue getting worse.  I want to be able to have an opinion on it."
Hi-5,"It doesn't make me miserable, I like to see it through. There are still things to be learned and there still may be good scenes or scenarios that are worth seeing. Inspiration comes from everywhere."
Hi-5,"Well that happens sometimes but for me, after years and years of watching trailers i have learnt to read the trailers better especially when i combine it with the wikipedia and imdb synopsis. And more importantly i know the type of shows that would hold my attention, those i would enjoy and those that are just great for background noise.

&#x200B;

And this isn't particularly hard to do as the trailers pretty much gives everything away. Take the new Apple+ show (Loot) whose trailer dropped yesterday, you could easily decipher what the show is about, what kind of humour it would gravitate towards considering the cast, writers and network it is on."
Hi-5,"You're a reader, yet you're answering questions in television sub. I think u've ended up in a wrong place, booky boy."
Hi-5,"I haven’t watched it, but you providing a single example doesn’t disprove anything. I said rarely, not never."
Hi-5,"This. I gave Moon Knight a 4th episode because up to that point Marvel hadn't ""failed"" any shows (varying degrees of good but none that were actively bad IMHO) and even though I was bored I wasn't uninterested."
Hi-5,I dont remember claiming I was disproving your point my guy lol
Hi-5,"Plus you never know when those little bastards are gonna take some small little thing and then later turn it into some crucial plot point that determines whether or not the next Thanos wins or loses.  

It's one of the coolest things about the MCU while also being one of the most annoying."

Hi-5,"nope, not from me"
Hi-5,"Tugged at my heartstrings, Um...

2. Hello, Elliot (Mr. Robot)

Hi-5,"Two come immediately to mind for me:

18th and Potomac- The West Wing

Hold The Door- GOT"
Hi-5,"The X-Files isn't my favorite show of all time but if I'm being real it does have probably six of my top 10 all-time favorite hours of television. Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose, Bad Blood, Jose Chung's From Outer Space, Home, Post-Modern Promethius - I could keep going. The show itself is kept from my top slot because of the huge number of garbage episodes but as individual episodes they're fantastic.

The Wire has a bunch of bangers but if I had to pick one it'd be S03E11. Can't talk about why without spoilers.

True Detective, either episode 1 or episode 4. Episode 1 introduces us so perfectly to the characters and the environment and effortlessly skips through time to establish the narrative. Episode 4 is one of the most tense, harrowing episodes of television ever broadcast.

Person of Interest final episode. The music cues are perfect and it wraps up a surprisingly incredible show flawlessly. 

Runner up goes to the season finale episodes of Dollhouse (last episodes of S1 and S2). It's too low-budget and has too many problems to actually get a top slot but in terms of vision and creativity Dollhouse was astounding television."
Hi-5,"House: ""Both Sides Now,"" the tower of strength, reduced to rubble."

Honorable Mention: You’re the Worst - Other Things You Could Be Doing"
Hi-5,I agree with The Body for the first half of the episode.  It falls apart at the end though when they have to fight a vampire in the hospital.   I felt it diminished the episode which would have been better served by not having any monsters in it.

Hi-5,First thing that jumped to my mind was when Col Henry Blake was killed on his way home on the show M\*A\*S\*H
Hi-5,"Better Call Saul S3E5 - Chicanery. Michael McKean's performance in the whole show, but particular in that episode was amazing. I consider the fact that he hasn't been absolutely showered with awards for it criminal.

Star Trek: The Next Generation: Half a Life S4E22 - Not sure how popular this episode was because it was a one-off that centered around side characters, but I was quite young when I saw it and it was the first time I'd ever seen a show really take on morally complex issues like the demands of aging and a person's right to choose when they die taken on in a show like that, and it's stuck with me.

The Walking Dead s2 E7 - Pretty Much Dead Already. The mid-season finale with the infamous barn scene. Zombie shows can feel like a battle of two extremes: the part of the fandom that want it to be practical and grounded and really show the nuance of how people fare when faced with their own mortality; and the part of the fandom that wants it to be fast paced, action packed and filled with jump scares and bad asses armed to the teeth mowing down hordes of nameless, faceless monsters. The Walking Dead has existed on both ends of this spectrum and every stop in between, but this was where the pitch was perfect for me. The Sophia reveal felt earned. So many carefully threaded story lines and formative character conflicts came to a head here in such an explosive way. It was frenzied and exciting, but also deeply resonant and emotional. But it wasn't just trauma porn, either. It moved the plot forward in a meaningful way.

Honorable Mention:  Better Call Saul S3E09 - Fall  It's not the whole episode, but watching the shocking scene with Kim towards the end. I didn't see that coming at all, which just speaks to how well it was built up, and I cannot tell you the swell of empathy I felt for her in this generation of watching people work themselves to death."

Hi-5,"You could do a whole list of just West Wing episodes;

In the Shadow of Two Gunman

Hi-5,Edith wasn't raped. That was clear. It was also clear she was about to be raped.
Hi-5,The book of Nora is simply amazing. I know I’m against most reddit in this but I thought the writing in seasons 2 and 3 was iffy. The finale was brilliant though
Hi-5,I'd heard for years about how good this specific episode is but when I finally watched the show I was mildly disappointed. It was good but I feel like it's overhyped and I wouldn't necessarily put it in the top three even.
Hi-5,"Yeah, they all are pretty hard hitting but the extreme last scene when Darlene says Hello, Elliot. It was really beautiful."
Hi-5,Absolutely. Two Cathedrals and 18th and Potomac go together anyway. I forgot he doesn’t curse god and throw the cigarette down until this episode.
Hi-5,"Yep, my memory fades after 50 years.."
Hi-5,Part of it is probably the shock those of us watching at the time felt.  You knew it was coming but for those of us at the time our jaws hit the floor especially because you see Joyce dead on the couch before Buffy does.

Aaaaand I'm tearing up."
The Blacklist,"It was long overdue imo. Show went from top notch entertainment to an absolute chore to watch. Story was stretched out too long in an uninteresting way. I stopped caring about the characters and the long running questions. I tapped out at around season 6 or 7, I don't remember.

Edit: That said, James Spader carried that show with his top notch performance. Nothing but respect for him as an actor."
The Blacklist,I know it’s cliche/douchey to say “this show is still on??” but I was genuinely shocked this was still on.
The Blacklist,[deleted]
The Blacklist,i love the show. but it's about time.
The Blacklist,James Spader is the only reason the show lasted 10 seasons. The plot became way too stretched out and convoluted but he was always amazing.
The Blacklist,Is that the Lizard King?
The Blacklist,"so we finally gonna find out that Red is her father's cousin's lover's twice removed nephew's uncle's stepson's nanny, or at least it's what it was implied when I stopped watching four seasons ago

is it still 22 episodes a season? I sorta want to come back but damn, that's a lot of runtime"
The Blacklist,"The show lost its core meaning after they killed off Elizabeth. Season 9 should have been the end, and it should have just been Red tying up loose ends. NBC chose greed over story."
The Blacklist,"I think I stopped around season 6. Spader was awesome and I would have just watched him in a chair chatting with Denbe and even the rest of the unit about parties. But how in bob's name did they manage to write one of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen.

One minute she is mission impossible and then the next scene she is handing her gun to random strangers because she panicked. All while constantly whining about some parent with her bad accent. I did like when they remembered she was supposed to be a profiler. Don't even get started with what happened to the dog or the kid. Nothing even against the actress, she was probably fine? I just can't think of anyone who would have saved the writing for that character.

Still worth a watch for a couple seasons!"
The Blacklist,4 seasons too late
The Blacklist,So is he her fucking dad or is he fucking not
The Blacklist,"Is this a good show as in actually good or is it good to pass time for a broadcast TV show?

Basically, is it more Chicago Fire or Sopranos?"
The Blacklist,James Spader can only chew so much scenery and flip so many hats
The Blacklist,Thank fuck.
The Blacklist,That’s funny it ended for me around season 2
The Blacklist,...didn't the protagonist of the show die like a season ago?
The Blacklist,Should have replaced Kevin Spacey in House of Cards with James Spader
The Blacklist,"I started watching The Blacklist in 2013 when it began. I was a senior in high school then, now I've gone through college and have been employed at my first ""real job"" for over 4 years. This show has been one of the only consistent things in my life.

It shined during it's earlier seasons, however even the newer seasons, while not as good as it once was, still had some decent episodes here and there.

Hat's off to James Spader and company, 10 seasons is very rare these days. I'll say they have a pretty good supporting cast as well. I'll miss the show, but look forward to it getting a proper ending (>!and maybe we'll finally learn if Red is in fact Katarina!<)!"
The Blacklist,It's still on?
The Blacklist,Still has a place in my heart for introducing me to some really good music in the first couple seasons.
The Blacklist,I stopped caring when it was confirmed that Reddington was Elizabeth's real father and stopped watching when they did that god awful CGI episode. The show wayyyy overstayed its welcome.
The Blacklist,This feels like it's been on 20 years.
The Blacklist,Bob Kazamakis needs to get back to his European gymnasts.
The Blacklist,"It was really, really good for 5-7 seasons. Got weird toward the end."
The Blacklist,"The problem with The Blacklist is that the writers basically just ran out of ideas, imo.

Too many of the ""bad guys"" were just double crossing former employers, and it got stale. A few of the retconned backstories were terrible, and the former female lead's character arc was just garbage the last few seasons.

When you have an entire season (9) that is built on misunderstandings, and a simple 2 minute conversation could resolve all conflict, it's not good writing, it's just crap tension being added to try to justify writing some episodes.

The Blacklist was a great show. It had its up and downs. But, the last 3 or 4 seasons was basically Reddington/James Spader carrying the entire show while they try to invent new situations and give things to do to old characters. I mean hell, the FBI gave Dembe a job, as a literal FBI field agent? Really!? There is no way, absolutely in any circumstance, is that a realistic character arc, but for some reason it is in the show.

I 100% understand why the show got 10 seasons, because it is an above average show, that had some absolutely stellar, blowout seasons, but then I 100% understand why the show is coming to an end."
The Blacklist,I'm still salty about what they did to Agent Samar Navabi. >!It was kind of awful of the writers to give her brain damage and then kick her character off the show entirely. She deserved better.!<
The Blacklist,"Another show canceled before it's time, so sad. There's so much more story left!"
The Blacklist,"Don't make me sit through 17 to 18 nothingburger episodes of a 23-episode order and expect me to come back, bailee halfway through Season 2."
The Blacklist,It’s about time.
The Blacklist,Stopped watching several seasons ago. I really dislike Elizabeth's character. Starting in like season 3 I had what would eventually be known as Redirena ideas. I never saw that came to fruition. I saw as far is who I assume was fake Katarina. Was I right?
The Blacklist,I actually stopped after the season before last and forgot about it.
The Blacklist,How James Spader carried that show for so long I’ll never know. My hats off to a superb actor.
The Blacklist,This shit is still on!?
The Blacklist,"After season 5 the show became meh, carried solely by James Spaders phenomenal performance. I watched until someone died at the end of season 8, enjoyed that, and never came back for 9"
The Blacklist,Oh thank god. Spader deserves better writing than that.
The Blacklist,"everything i love gets canceled and then sometimes with other shows i go ""wait, that was still a thing?""

The Blacklist,this show was a guilty pleasure for me at some point but I stopped watching when they did that cartoon episode
The Blacklist,"About goddamned time.  The show is a parody of what it once was.

Give Spader a new law show and bring back a ""veteran"" Alan Shore as the head of his own firm in NYC.  Put him up against the *Law and Order* crowd every once in a while to show they're not above getting their asses kicked."
The Blacklist,Jesus I forgot this show was still on
The Blacklist,"David Spade carried the who show on his back. 
Apart from him, it’s a very mediocre show"
The Blacklist,I noped out of this show when she had the baby and said something stupid and cliche like “they’ve got my DAUGHTER” four times an episode. Up until then this was a spectacular show. It just became derivative and predictable.
The Blacklist,An office spin off about Robert California.
The Blacklist,TIL The Blacklist is still on. If you asked me to guess I would have said it was canceled after 4 seasons. Had no idea.
The Blacklist,TIL:  The Blacklist is still running
The Blacklist,I stopped watching around Season 4. Did they ever confirm if Red is Liz’s father?
The Blacklist,I thought that show ended 5 years ago…
The Blacklist,Finally. Once Keen left the show went downhill.
The Blacklist,"If you have an overarching mystery, you need to make progress on resolving it instead of just stringing viewers along.

This show would have worked better if they had a clear start/end point.

Also for being an elite FBI unit a lot of the members were idiotic."
The Blacklist,It's still going?
The Blacklist,No idea it was still going
The Blacklist,I had no idea it was still on.  i stopped watching when they did the backdoor pilot for the husband getting his own show.
The Blacklist,This show is still going on????
The Blacklist,TIL that show is still on the air.
The Blacklist,I had no idea this show was still on
The Blacklist,I thought it ended awhile ago?
The Blacklist,So he's for sure her dad right? That was the hook for like 2-3 seasons.
The Blacklist,Wow: I had no idea that this show was still on.
The Blacklist,One of those shows that I completely lost interest in after three seasons.
The Blacklist,shit shoulda ended in like season 3
The Blacklist,My theory is James Spader bombed on the office on purpose to do this show instead
The Blacklist,"I used to love The Blacklist, but the show's quality has dropped in recent years. Happy to see that it's finally ending."
The Blacklist,TIL the blacklist is still on TV
The Blacklist,This show is still on?
The Blacklist,That show was still going?
The Blacklist,"TIL The Blacklist is still on the air.

Is Robert California still in it?"
The Blacklist,Obligatory “it’s still going?!”
The Blacklist,Racist
The Blacklist,Is this thing still working? I remember watching a few episodes on TV. That was 8-9 years ago. I never heard anything about him again
The Blacklist,Oh cool maybe theyll stop avoifing answers now
The Blacklist,At this point it putting it out of its misery.
The Blacklist,Seasons 1-2 were good then the story just got way too drawn out. Spader was hot fire as Red.
The Blacklist,"Didn’t know this show was still on only watched S1, but good Spader too good of an actor to waste on this Network Tv Show."
The Blacklist,"TV Grim Reaper has put this down as a renanceling - if a show's next season is announced as the final one before it airs an episode, it's renanceled.

Probably the best way to go out, I would say. The villains of the week have generally been interesting (I find myself wondering where they get their ideas from) and Reddington has always been great to watch. But it's had its day."
The Blacklist,Wow didn't even know this was still ongoing.
The Blacklist,Hopefully it’s a satisfying conclusion
The Blacklist,I'll follow James Spader anywhere.  A new character and writers sounds fucking great to me.
The Blacklist,Talk about beating a dead horse….
The Blacklist,Love his acting
The Blacklist,Imma FaceTime with my mom tonight
The Blacklist,Amazed this series lasted that long.  Should have ended at 5ish at most
The Blacklist,My mom told me all about the season 6 finale and haven’t watched since. I think I’ll FaceTime her tonight.
The Blacklist,"I’ll watch it tell the end , I’m in WAAAAY too deep"
The Blacklist,"I tapped out at season 5, wow that's got to be a lot of episodes."
The Blacklist,"Amazing this show is still on, especially compared to all the good shows Netflix has canceled recently."
The Blacklist,Solid show - felt it has run 1-2 seasons too long - hope it ends well.
The Blacklist,Should’ve ended on season 3
The Blacklist,He will always be Robert California to me.
The Blacklist,Don't forget Survivor is in like the 22nd season. Also The Today show may be the longest running show.
The Blacklist,"Holy fuck, I really did think this show was going to run until the heat death of the universe. Ah, well: it was fucking terrible - an ouroboros of awful characterization and nonsensical plotting (if you can coherently tell me just what the fuck Liz's backstory even is and just which characters are key to it and how, I'll give you a shiny penny) - so it's not a huge loss, but I'll miss getting a weekly dosage of James Spader. Hopefully its demise will free him up to act in things that actually deserve him."
The Blacklist,"It’s still on? I remember the first few seasons being good. Props to Fox for actually having a long term show that wasn’t a mediocre fire,ems, crime, medical blank"
The Blacklist,I remember working on recap videos for S1 episodes that included interviews with the cast. One of my first gigs out of school. It was a fun project. Man does time fly. 10 seasons!
The Blacklist,"Wow, I assumed it had finished years ago. Got bored and dropped out at S4 or thereabouts."
The Blacklist,"10 seasons?! Honestly, who watches this crap. Robert California should left on a high note"
The Blacklist,I was convinced this show was cancelled like 6 years ago
The Blacklist,Should have ended with season five. The show became illogical and boring.
The Blacklist,"Sorry, for me it ended with season 6. Just to ridiculous to watch."
The Blacklist,"The fact I had to look up on google a few months ago if the blacklist was still around or when it was coming back kinda says a lot. I had our DVR set up to record new episodes over a year ago and so about once a week I would see a new episode pop up and would watch it. Then it seemed like last year I would check it periodically and still not see anything and wonder where the episodes were and would have to google to see when the new season is suppose to be etc. 

There was multiple times during a few seasons where I would turn on the DVR expecting a new episode only to see nothing and then having to waste time searching on google to find they postponed an episode for a week either because of the fact they didn't get it finished in time, or in some cases some stupid sports game taking up the slot kinda annoyed me. 

The show had an interesting set up and quite interesting kinda first season but then it kept hinging on and focusing on Liz and the backstory etc. But then the last season I watched where they had a short plot point of someone coming back from the dead possibly (not gonna say cause it will spoil it for those who want to watch it) but it only happens over the course of like 1-2 episodes? and the reveal is explained to you by Red in a different scene (like you don't actually end up seeing it happen) was really annoying. At least from what I remember, and that kinda annoyed me a bit. Like almost feels like they are phoning it in at this point so yeah. 

I kinda get the feeling like it could have been something like Burn Notice in a way with it's feel but after the first 2 seasons? It started going down hill and lost the charm it had started out with. 

Also just makes me even more angry at the fact that it's lasted this long when the past few seasons have been panned by many viewers but a show like Forever was cancelled after like one season which had a really interesting story/premise, and characters but I guess wasn't as popular?"
The Blacklist,I thought this show was off the air like 5-6 years ago.
The Blacklist,"It's definitely time, it started going awry in season 9, was a great show though"
The Blacklist,People made it past season 1? Like from the first couple of episodes you could see it was dumb as f.
Breaking Bad,"I'm glad. Saul isn't someone who gets his hands dirty, he arranges solutions from a distance. They needed Mike."
Breaking Bad,"Breaking Bad is a series of happy accidents, isn't it?"
Breaking Bad,"And Odenkirk probably would not have had that role if he had gotten the lead part in The Office. 

So, thank you Steve Carrell for Better Call Saul!"
Breaking Bad,Stay away from my granddaughter
Breaking Bad,Vince Gilligan is either the luckiest person on earth or he somehow has an unnatural ability to create gold from nothing
Breaking Bad,Bob Odenkirk wasn't unavailable the day they shot the aftermath of Jane's overdose so they rewrote the scene for it to be Saul's PI. Fun fact other than his introduction none of that first scene was rewritten for the new character. So next time you watch the scene just imagine Saul there instead.
Breaking Bad,"And if Troy didn’t go sailing w Levar, Shirley didn’t start starring in a procedural w a PI in a wheelchair, and Pierce didn’t die of masturbation (being a racist), Mike wouldn’t have changed his identity to Buzz Hicks at Greendale Community College."
Breaking Bad,kid named finger
Breaking Bad,"Wow I'm back in 2012

I need to buy bitcoin"
Breaking Bad,"Really just goes to show you that some of the best things are improvised and figured out along the way, rather than having everything figured out from the start. So glad that Vince had the forethought to embrace change and change it as he went, cause I certainly can't imagine the show without Jesse or Mike."
Breaking Bad,I’m sorry mike
Breaking Bad,Kid named it was meant to be
Breaking Bad,only michael can be michael life wouldnt be real if saul were michael
Breaking Bad,Thank “How I Met Your Mother”
Breaking Bad,Kid named available
Breaking Bad,Holy fuck I was so scared seeing Jonathan Banks on here I thought he died
Breaking Bad,"Whenever anyone says some tv show needs a plan to be done well, remember most of your favorite shows had no plan at all."
Breaking Bad,He's a regular at my work.  Him and his wife are the nicest people
Breaking Bad,"Banks’s character played a massive role in making that series what it was. Next to Jessie, Mike was my favorite."
Breaking Bad,"Honestly, having watched Odenkirk's performance as Hutch in the 2021 Film Nobody, I feel like he'd make a memorable Mike Ehrmantraut in his own way in an alternative universe.

He's beyond incredible as Jimmy/Saul though, and Mike played by Banks still remains one of my favorite fictional character portrayals of all time."
Breaking Bad,scariest old man ever. I love characters with brains and Mike was a goddamned genius
Breaking Bad,Waltuh
Breaking Bad,Waltuh
Breaking Bad,Finguh
Breaking Bad,Mike was my favorite character
Breaking Bad,Finguh
Breaking Bad,I can hardly believe they were truly making it up as they went along in both breaking bad and better call saul.
Breaking Bad,Wally pip
Breaking Bad,"kinda wish they went this route, would have been nice to see Saul do that stuff."
Breaking Bad,pimento
Breaking Bad,He cracked me up in community.
Breaking Bad,isn’t this the kid named finger?
Breaking Bad,Waltah…
Breaking Bad,[deleted]
Breaking Bad,This is a stupid headline. Both are awesome. Fuck you.
Breaking Bad,"You missed the point of this completely!

They wrote the lines for this character and not Saul’s character.

So you can say imagine Saul in that scene but if you do so, you will have to imagine the lines that Saul’s character would’ve said and not Mike.

Pfftt!"
Breaking Bad,Bob was available though?
Breaking Bad,I like how people are suddenly pretending this is new information due to Rhea Seehorn mentioning it in an interview recently.
Breaking Bad,"I’m probably an outlier here , but I’m not a huge Mike E fan. I’d rather have had more Saul personally"
Breaking Bad,Huh!  That explains why Mike appears out of literally nowhere in the story.
Breaking Bad,Watch what you say about Professor Buzz Hickey.
Breaking Bad,"Honestly both Saul and Mike are the entire best thing about both BB and BCS.

Recently watched both shows in the span of two weeks and I can’t fully endorse the show. But I will always tell people that not only is BCS the better show, but both Mike and Saul are far too perfect for it."
Breaking Bad,That’s what I call a “happy accident”. :) I love him.
Breaking Bad,Needed Dirty Mike and the Boys
Breaking Bad,">	Saul isn’t someone who gets his hands dirty, he arranges solutions from a distance

Unless it’s with Lalo. Jimmy is always stuck with Lalo"
Breaking Bad,">Saul isn't someone who gets his hands dirty

He literally crawled into the dumpster at Sandpiper.

Edit: you guys, I don't care."
Breaking Bad,"I’m imagining an alternate timeline where Saul does everything himself and has his whole lawyer act, while being incredibly dangerous like Mike."
Breaking Bad,[deleted]
Breaking Bad,"Saul relies on Huey first, if Huey won't do it, then Mike does it."
Breaking Bad,"It really is, and shows how a great showrunner can make or break a show. Gilligan put together a team who could roll with the punches and everyone did their specific jobs incredibly well and it shows."
Breaking Bad,"One of the best things about this show is how off the cuff it really was. The writers apparently didn’t piece together how the show would end until they met up to actually write out the final episodes. Just a testament that no matter how far out things seemed to get during the show, the Breaking Bad/BCS team knew how to tie everything together"
Breaking Bad,"I think creativity thrives best with constraints, they were solid opportunists."
Breaking Bad,"As they say, luck favors the well-prepared. Jonathan Banks paid dues for 40 years before playing Mike Ehrmantraut. He was ready."
Breaking Bad,"Yeah, Vince was also originally opposed to fleshing out Lalo in BCS, saying something like not every i needs to be dotted.

Peter Gould pushed for that one iirc, and we got an amazing character bc of it."
Breaking Bad,In an alternate universe Steve Carrell is Saul.
Breaking Bad,Is that why he shows up in an episode where Pam is looking for a new job and he plays a character whose identical to Micheal Scott?
Breaking Bad,"They would have had to go with Odenkirk as the second choice if it weren't for Carell's then current show, Come to Papa getting cancelled so quickly. So thank you Tom Papa for Better Call Saul!"
Breaking Bad,"I asked ChatGPT to produce a scene. This is just pure genius...  

INT. DUNDER MIFFLIN OFFICE - DAY  
  
Michael Scott is standing at his desk, wearing a hazmat suit, a gas mask, and yellow gloves.  
  
MICHAEL (to the camera): Today, I'm going to show you how to make some serious money.  

CUT TO:  
  
EXT. DUNDER MIFFLIN PARKING LOT - DAY  
  
(Michael is standing in the parking lot, holding a bag of blue crystals)   

MICHAEL (to a group of shady-looking men): Hey, guys! Who wants to buy some meth?  

(The men look at Michael skeptically)  
  
SHADY MAN #1: What the hell are you wearing, man?  
  
MICHAEL (smiling): It's a hazmat suit! Safety first, am I right?  

SHADY MAN #2: What's in the bag?  

MICHAEL (showing the bag): Blue crystals! The best meth you'll ever try!  

SHADY MAN #3: How much?  

MICHAEL (looking at his hand): Hmm, let me check. (pretends to weigh the meth on his hand) I can sell you this for... (dramatic pause) fifty dollars.    

(The men burst out laughing)  
 
SHADY MAN #1: Fifty dollars for that tiny bag?  

MICHAEL (defensive): Hey, this is high-quality stuff! You won't find anything better on the street!  

SHADY MAN #2: We'll give you ten bucks for it.  

MICHAEL (outraged): Ten bucks? Are you kidding me?  

SHADY MAN #3: Take it or leave it.  

(Michael hesitates for a moment, then reluctantly hands over the bag)  

MICHAEL (to the camera): Well, that didn't go as planned. But you know what they say: if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.  

CUT TO:  

INT. DUNDER MIFFLIN BREAK ROOM - DAY  

(Michael is sitting at the table, surrounded by beakers and chemicals)  

MICHAEL (to the camera): I'm going to tweak my recipe a little bit. I'm sure the next batch will be even better.  

(As Michael starts to mix the chemicals, a loud explosion is heard)  

CUT TO:  

EXT. DUNDER MIFFLIN PARKING LOT - DAY  

(The office building is on fire, and Michael is running away from it, still wearing his hazmat suit)  

MICHAEL (to the camera, out of breath): Well, it looks like I won't be selling meth anytime soon. But hey, at least I tried!  

(The camera pans out to show the entire Dunder Mifflin building engulfed in flames)"
Breaking Bad,I for some reason didn’t register “Bob Odenkirk” and thought it was Mike’s actor trying out for the lead in The Office and that was a whole rabbit hole of “how would that work?”
Breaking Bad,He would of been a way better Michael Scott than Steve imo tho
Breaking Bad,If you come near our granddaughter you'll end up in a Chicago overcoat.
Breaking Bad,"Do not, under any stircumstances, help her get out of any stitchuation"
Breaking Bad,How many of us here listen to CBB?
Breaking Bad,"If you see a little girl, looking precious, you better turn around and walk away"
Breaking Bad,Ok “Pop Pop!”
Breaking Bad,We’re grand brothers
Breaking Bad,So what you are saying is that he is an alchemist. Seems legit.
Breaking Bad,"If it was just breaking bad, you could call him lucky, but with bCS afterwards, I'm sure we can all agree he's just that good. Yes I know he only wrote the first 2 seasons, he's still great."
Breaking Bad,[deleted]
Breaking Bad,Or... made a deal with the devil... none of my offers for deals with the devil ever gave me shit though... I guess I just don't have anything that the devil wants.
Breaking Bad,"I definitely wouldn't have found the character of Saul as captivating if that had happened. He worked perfectly as the danger-averse craven little slimeball lawyer than somebody who has his wits together enough to help cover up an actual crime scene.

So this is the perfect happy little accident for everyone involved, and one that ended up making the series even better than it was."
Breaking Bad,just to show how a performer can alter the same lines with their performance
Breaking Bad,"The scene where Mike and Walt drive to the crackhouse definitely works as a Saul/Walt scene. ""You could just get mugged or shot."""
Breaking Bad,"He’s a duck, his name is Jim, and PUBLISHERS ARE INTERESTED!"
Breaking Bad,Pop Pop!!
Breaking Bad,Hi my names Kevin and I have Changnesia
Breaking Bad,waltuh
Breaking Bad,[deleted]
Breaking Bad,Thought I was on r/Stuck10YearsBehind for a minute!
Breaking Bad,DM me in a few years and remind me to sell
Breaking Bad,Okay Werner Ziegler
Breaking Bad,Guess that piece of shit was good for something
Breaking Bad,"Nah, they had a plan. They had the best of both worlds, a solid plan, but the flexibility to see where it needed to be tweaked and what the best changes were to improve it. No plan is just as bad as too rigid a plan, there's a happy medium that BB perfectly nailed. I've heard it said that a good plan is the bed for the garden of creativity, this is a great example."
Breaking Bad,"> no plan at all.

I dunno about all that, feels like they had a pretty solid plan from the start."
Breaking Bad,"NO PLAN AT ALL

NO PLAN AT ALL

NO PLAN AT ALL

STUPID SEXY BREAKING BAD!"
Breaking Bad,Why wasn’t I told?
Breaking Bad,Maybe read the article
Breaking Bad,or maybe not every single person knows every conceivable piece of random trivia about every tv show
Breaking Bad,Thanks for the F-Shack
Breaking Bad,You got a red prius?
Breaking Bad,Then an opossum came in and gave birth on the floor. It was really gross
Breaking Bad,soup kitchen
Breaking Bad,You ever heard of a stackin' jack?
Breaking Bad,How'd you know who we are?
Breaking Bad,Mike’s Dirty Jobs
Breaking Bad,"Oh man, when they put Howard in the fridge and bought another fridge to replace the one they took. Cold blooded"
Breaking Bad,"I think Jimmy/Early Saul is a totally different vibe from Breaking Bad Saul, though.

BCS Jimmy didn't have a lot of resources or help, but by the time BrBa rolls around, Saul has people to do the dirty work for him."
Breaking Bad,You could say his character developed.
Breaking Bad,"I think you have misinterpreted what, “gets his hands dirty” means. It’s a metaphor for doing ugly physical work like beating or killing people. Unless of course you were just having some fun with the literal interpretation."
Breaking Bad,That's a far cry from cleaning up a crime scene with a dead girl.
Marco Polo,"It's worth noting that this is Netflix's first outright cancellation, not a ""you get one more season to wrap things up"" deal"
Marco Polo,"In the words of Zuko - 

*That's rough buddy.*"
Marco Polo,So many tasteful orgies
Marco Polo,This bums me out. I really enjoyed this show and I'm surprised by the cancellation. Benedict Wong's Kublai Khan was simply magnetic. 
Marco Polo,Omg what the fuck. Do you know what kind of cliffhanger we are left with? 
Marco Polo,Maybe Netflix will pick it up.
Marco Polo,"WHAT!?   Oh man, Benedict Wong is some god tier shit.  

I'm truly saddened.  I don't know why this show never picked up an audience.  Had some of the best scenery on TV.  "
Marco Polo,"It seems like most of their originals get 3 seasons minimum.  But I'm not wildly surprised about this, the show doesn't get a lot of buzz and I've heard it's very expensive."
Marco Polo,"Really too bad, but not that unexpected. It was a BEAUTIFUL show, the sets and costumes were phenomenal with lots of excellent acting. The story and era were really interesting to. It just didn't connect with audiences the way it needed to. "
Marco Polo,":(

I haven't finished season 2 quite yet, but does it wrap up in a way that is satisfying, knowing that it's now canceled? "
Marco Polo,"Dang, that Hundred Eyes character, was one of my favorites. 

"
Marco Polo,[deleted]
Marco Polo,"I tried watching it - didn't have the historical accuracy of Rome or the fantasy appeal of GoT. It was in a weird middle ground, and for me it didn't work. "
Marco Polo,"""Marco"". .  . . . *silence*"
Marco Polo,NOOOOOOOOOoooo! i really liked this show.  :(
Marco Polo,Whaaat?! Noooooo!!!
Marco Polo,"Cant they at least make a movie to tie it all up, fuck's sake. "
Marco Polo,"too bad, I really enjoyed it"
Marco Polo,What a shame. Was a great show. There is a lot of stuff I would have put on the bubble for cancellation before Marco Polo. It will be missed.
Marco Polo,Damn. Second season had some serious cliffhangers. Sucks. 
Marco Polo,Nooooo! 
Marco Polo,Lame. This show kicked ass. 
Marco Polo,Not surprised. The budget is insane and there isn't any real buzz on the show. Also it's nothing really special.
Marco Polo,I genuinely loved this show. Watched Season 2 all in a row on the day/day after it was released.
Marco Polo,"I never watched the show, but this fanvid made it look very pretty (and interesting):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtodOF9WED4"
Marco Polo,Everyone is taking about how much it cost to make an episode. I'd be happy with a conclusion set solely in the throne room with pure dialog. I loved this show :(
Marco Polo,"Benedict Wong was awesome on that show. If it was a show about Kublai Khan, it would be more popular. The Marco Polo stuff always dragged it down for me. Kublai was interesting. "
Marco Polo,Aww man I loved this show
Marco Polo,"Fucks sake Netflix, this show was half the reason I have a subscription in the first place - along with the massacre of third party content on there I might unsubscribe. "
Marco Polo,"I watched the first season and about 3 episodes into the 2nd before giving up. Besides Benedict Wong, who rocked his role,  I didn't find it to be a good show. I only stuck with it because of my love for the history of the khans "
Marco Polo,I quit after season 1. Was season 2 any better?
Marco Polo,"If they had also cancelled Fuller House and The Ranch, maybe I wouldn't have minded as much. 

In all seriousness, I'm unsubscribing from Netflix for now. I'll come back for OitNB and Stranger Things.
"
Marco Polo,"I've never once seen this advertised, featured, or recommended on Netflix, but it sounds interesting to me. I wonder if that is part of why it failed... "
Marco Polo,"It was a cool concept, but poorly executed and in general fairly bad acting. Netflix doesn't always produce Gold. I just hope this is a wake up call that Netflix still has a way to go before they're HBO or for that matter Prime Television. With show's like the Expanse coming on board and the CW verse being pretty fun. Netflix will have to up its game, it won't be able to survive on just Comic book heroes and historical figures alone. House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, and arguably Longmire are it's biggest shows. Even Amazon is happily catching up. Competition is great for creativity and innovation. "
Marco Polo,"nooo that sucks ... im always a sucker for historical drama

this a a shame Wong was amazing but thankfully there is soo many other shows to watch"
Marco Polo,"Well, gotta make more room for superheroes I guess..."
Marco Polo,What?  Everyone I know watches and loves this show.  I legit have suggested it to so many people and I can't think of one person who didn't end up absolutely loving the show.  100 eyes might be one of my favorite characters from any show ever!  This is an absolute surprise to me and I honestly cannot believe that this show will not continue.  I am genuinely upset that I will not get to see more seasons of this as it was by far the show I was most looking forward to a new season of.
Marco Polo,That's heartbreaking..... I really loved this show!
Marco Polo,WHY?! Netflix you keep shit shows on the air for 3 or 4 seasons and you can't keep this!?
Marco Polo,"They had a chance to make something great- truly one of the most amazing men in history (read books about him, PLEASE), and they made it a soap opera with sex.

So sad."
Marco Polo,"I was going to watch this after I finished Narcos. Glad this happened now if it had to happen.

I'm honestly shocked though, Netflix doesn't do this sort of thing."
Marco Polo,Dammit!
Marco Polo,Yeah....I watched both seasons and honestly I completely forgot how season 2 even ended. I had to think about it for a minute
Marco Polo,Weird. I loved season 1. Didnt even know season 2 was out. 
Marco Polo,"Season Two really didn't peak my interest at all, not in the way that Season One did. I haven't even finished watching. "
Marco Polo,"Honestly couldn't care less, it seems like one of those shows that doesn't have the balls to go fantasy but it also doesn't have the pride and decency to be historically accurate, it is basically writers making up shit as they go along like Vikings, but that at least had some atmosphere. "
Marco Polo,TIL Netflix had a Marco Polo show
Marco Polo,"Friggin Marco Polo. It looks incredible, the cast outside of the guy playing Marco Polo is spectacular. The show just had such weak and muddled story lines. 

I am bummed it is cancelled."
Marco Polo,Well Season Two was a huge flop. I love season one but then they just ruined it.
Marco Polo,I read it as Narcos for a second and shit myself 
Marco Polo,That really really sucks.  That show was a guilty pleasure.
Marco Polo,I will miss you Asian Game of Thrones 😞
Marco Polo,"Dang, this was one of those obviously flawed shows that I loved anyway.  Asian setting TV historical drama is awesome, but there isn't much of it out there besides  Korean dramas and stuff.  I love some of those Korean dramas (thus why i am talking up such an obscure concept)...but they are hurt by the low budget and formulaic scripts.  I hope this show isn't the death of trying to do this sort of thing on a bigger scale that is more approachable to western audiences.  The flaws of this show were in execution, not concept.  There  was some top notch stuff in this show anyway.  Fantastic kung fu scenes, a lot of great intrigue plots...but so much weird sexual stuff.  Don't try and be Game of Thrones here, you don't have to be.  The repeated focus on pedaphilia too...I mean that isn't even titillating, just purely disgusting.  "
Marco Polo,Oh no! I was really eager to see how prestor John was going to play into the narrative. Bummer
Marco Polo,Nooooooooooo! I love that show :(
Marco Polo,Marco 
Marco Polo,"If the show had a different name, like Kublai khan, I think it would have had a lot more followers.

Me and my Mrs avoided it at first, not knowing enough about Marco and after starting a little late, enjoyed every episode.

Damn shame, the endless Netflix budget finally has a limit."
Marco Polo,***Am I the only one who didn't like this show?***
Marco Polo,This makes me worried for The Get Down :(
Marco Polo,"I get it to be honest. The show looks pretty expensive and the actual quality of the show didn't reflect that. Ratings probably weren't very good either.

It was okay, but certainly not great. Would have been a shitty show without Benedict Wong (Kublai Khan).

I think they made the right choice, with the money they poured into MP they could probably create something actually great."
Marco Polo,The writing for this show has always been very sub-par and formulaic.
Marco Polo,Sadness
Marco Polo,"I think it's a pretty neat thing they can do with data and cost-return analysis, from a Netflix Corporate perspective.  Like someone else said, Netflix has all the data on the cost per episode and the # of times watched.  It's a good way for them to weigh the value of their shows, without needing a 3rd party to intervene or guess or interpret (that being said, I have no idea how regular TV determines how many people watched X show).

I liked season 1, season 2 was slow to start, so I've suspended my watching of it... but I'll probably finish watching what's there.  If they re-allocate those funds to another good show, I'm not super heart-broken about it, though.

"
Marco Polo,"I really liked the first season and the hundred eyes one shot. But second season couldn't hold me. Got only a few episodes in. Very saddened by this. I always thought the acting was fantastic on this show, along with the production value and music. It's the writing that failed this show I think.

So should I try to finish the second season at all- is it worth it? "
Marco Polo,Can we cancel numb3rs too? 
Marco Polo,"Damn I liked it. Well if you remove the last scene, most of the ends were wrapped up beforehand for the most part. "
Marco Polo,"I did not enjoy this show very much. Random accents (why not standardize? In an Asian period drama, why is one prince Australian and another from the northeast?) and an obvious attempt to emulate Game of Thrones made it just bleh. "
Marco Polo,"Amazing premise, just what I like watching. Didn't enjoy a single minute of it. Started browsing the internet 20 secs into the intro. Barely made it through 2 episodes. Not surprised by this at all. "
Marco Polo,Why does this headline make me now want to watch it.
Marco Polo,"Dang, I actually really liked the show and am sad to see it end on a cliffhanger.

Can any history buffs give me an idea on how it's supposed to end?"
Marco Polo,"Think that's their first cancellation....can see why too, fucking boring and not watched by anyone. Production was great but I got 2 episodes in and gave up. Put it on for my parents who enjoyed it, then they tried to watch season 2 when it came out and they gsv up on it aswell, literally heard no one else talk about it."
Marco Polo,Watched season one... There was no character I fell in love with that made me want to come back for the second season. Found the direction and acting to be somewhat pompous. Only likable character was the blind ninja dude.
Marco Polo,So now that the show is cancelled do you recommend watching or it doesn't end well?
Marco Polo,"I can't say I'm too surprised. I've seen season 1 and loved Benedict Wong's performance and the superficial trappings (such as the costumes, locations, sets...) but didn't get much out of the actual show. Obviously a talented bunch worked on it though so I hope they move onto brighter things."
Marco Polo,Never was there a show that That I enjoyed but still thought it tried to be too many things in one than this show. I'm kinda not surprised given the cost that it was cancelled. I hope the guy that plays genghis continues to get work(just in doctor strange) he was amazing in the role
Marco Polo,I hope Netflix picks this show 
Marco Polo,"/me looks out the windows. 

Curious, Netflix canceled a show and its not the end of the world, i wonder if they will also proceed to cancer other crap like F for Family. "
Marco Polo,"Frankly, I'm not surprised. The writing, pacing and main character were incredibly weak. It was an incredibly forgettable show, which was a pity, given just how good Benedict Wong was. However, he was the only bright spark in the show. "
Marco Polo,Oh man this sucks.  I was really looking forward to seeing Kublai Khan's failed attempts at invasion of Japan.  C'est la vie.
Marco Polo,Awwww I liked this show! 
Marco Polo,I guess Asa Akira will have to fill my quota of hot naked asian chicks.
Marco Polo,Sweet! Can i buy one of those AWESOME guard costumes.... with the mask?
Marco Polo,"Aw come on, I need a wrap up season, or hell, a wrap of movie! Don't just leave it there!"
Marco Polo,It didn't help they released season 1 then waited an extraordinarily long time for season 2! It was more then a year apart! 
Marco Polo,"It was a good 4k presentation. I mean it was very pretty and 4k made it prettier. Unlike Orange is the New Black in 4k, pock marked prison bitches were revolting to watch, had to go back to 1080p. 

Show itself was weak. Also, Netflix took a big risk going all Asian. But listening to a bunch of dudes speak with their broken ass English was kind of insulting. Like yeah bro, they're Asian, but pick some people who don't have accents. 

All Asian just isn't SAFE yet. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmvqb9Uzu8k&feature=youtu.be

This isn't what Jonathan wanted. "
Marco Polo,"They should have focused on ghengis, why start after the exciting part!?"
Marco Polo,Noooooooo. I really loved the rich visualization of this quasi-history 
Marco Polo,The first season had some legit Northern Shaolin.
Marco Polo,"Sad, but understandable, the first season got it right with the fantastical aspect. The 'whole new world' and the mutual discovery of other cultures along with Marco was cool, but the second season was just corny drama. Too much of a soap opera. 

Good to see Benedict Wong freed up for some more work elsewhere."
Marco Polo,"Not at all surprising, but I will have fond memories of this show despite the shoddy script. "
Marco Polo,"Im my opinion Netflex should just adapt ""The Ravages of Time"" if they wanna produce a show about Eastern warfares. The comic as for now has enough materials for multiple seasons already."
Marco Polo,"It's too bad, I loved the first season. I binged on it and finished it in a day. The second season, however, I wasn't able to get through the third episode.   
I left it there and don't really plan on going back to it. At least Netflix has an abundance of other OC to watch."
Marco Polo,Noooooooo
Marco Polo,"I'm really disappointed, my favorite Netflix show is cancelled. 8 million dollars an episode but they never advertised it, sabotage!"
Marco Polo,This was my favorite show on Netflix.  I have been patiently waiting for season 3.  My morning is ruined.
Marco Polo,nooo. i loved this show
Marco Polo,That sucks
Marco Polo,watched the first season... never bothered pirating the next that how you can tell a show is bad.
Marco Polo,Man you gotta do really bad to get cancelled by Netflix.  
Marco Polo,Couldn't really get into the show anyways. 
House of Cards,> The arbitrator found that Spacey’s conduct constituted a material breach of his acting and executive producing agreements.
House of Cards,Spacey has basically no way to make more money at this point. Most celebrities would be able to take some speaking fee or show up at a rich person's party or something. Maybe someone out there would very confidentially pay him for acting lessons.
House of Cards,"House of Cards got the whole streaming universe going.

It was top notch when it came out and it got everybody’s attention and respect == huge hit, boost, for NetFlix and the new age of streaming."
House of Cards,Spacey needs to pay me 31 million for fucking up House of Cards. I was heavily invested.
House of Cards,[removed]
House of Cards,"Delightful. He's the only celebrity who has ever been an asshole to me and I have enjoyed every single moment of watching the little perv's downfall.

(Edit: My offense? He came after me on Twitter with insults way back when I liked him and @'ed him about a glowing review I had read of a movie he was in. Apparently the little diva doesn't read reviews and he seriously got pissed that I dared post a link to one.)"
House of Cards,I feel like I deserve some of that money because I was denied a good final season (not that the prior season was much better).
House of Cards,Looking forward to his next YouTube videos now.
House of Cards,"This really brings home how little Alex
Jones has to pay in comparison."
House of Cards,Any chance he tries coming out again with/as something different?
House of Cards,i'm confused that being called out for acts from the 1990s somehow in the 2010s was a breach of contract unless Kevin Spacey is some sort of Pedo Doctor Who type
House of Cards,"Good, Stop grabbing mens bits you creepy fuck."
House of Cards,There’s always barber school
House of Cards,"Fake president gets removed from TV show and must pay damages for allegations of being sexual predator.

Trump admits on tape to being a sexual predator and is still elected President.

The world is very strange."
House of Cards,Sexual misconduct. I'm sorry but did they just forget what it's actually called. Rape. Kevin Spacey is a pedophilic rapist!
House of Cards,Doesn’t alex Jones have to pay 5 million to the parents of sandy hook? Was this that much worse? Seems like Reddit thinks alex Jones crimes are much worse considering the upvote counts and number of posts about each topic.
House of Cards,he has to pay 31 M and Alex Jones who is the vilest human on earth gets a 4.1 M judgement
House of Cards,He should request the Alex Jones jury.
House of Cards,The house of cards innocent sucked because he was really good in that show. But he's getting what he deserves.
House of Cards,"After House of Cards season 3 came out but before I watched it, I had a big twist ruined for me, so I never got around to watching it. Consequently, the last episode I saw was where he became president. In retrospect, I think I lucked out; finished the series on a banger of a high note, at a point at which it would've made sense for it to end."
House of Cards,"Drop in the bucket for him, I'm sure."
House of Cards,literally wtf was ‘American Beauty’ after not being able to finish that movie I couldn’t not see him like a total weirdo
House of Cards,Nice
House of Cards,Time to rent everything like OJ
House of Cards,He must have love jack hammering that reporter in house of cards..
House of Cards,"Welp, judge just got added to his hit list."
House of Cards,"I don't get it, I thought I read Spacey was getting money for damages. It seems actors are guilty until proven innocent. Perhaps Spacey needs to get Johnny Depp's lawyer..."
House of Cards,"This is scary. He hasn't been found guilty of anything and whereas we all can probably agree he needs to pay for his (alleged) crimes, this seems like putting the cart before the horse. He hasn't been found guilty. They fired him based on a conversation with someone that may have happened 30 years ago. 

This could be us. We can be accused, fired (maybe our job didnt want to pay our huge salary so they set us up, allegations, fired. So many reasons this couldve happened and not just the possibility he actually committed these crimes. Just don't see how you can be guilty of a tort you created (by firing him) and didn't wait for an actual judgement. 

They could have waited a year or two and put him back on. They chose to fire him bc of the MeToo movement and the guy coming out. Everyone in hollyweird knows what he's capable of. 

Apparently, he is capable of earning these fuckers 30 mil a year so they kept quiet as long as they could

It's asshole vs asshole from my seat

FBI raiding presidential residences without an appropriate warrant; people gotta pay a year's worth of, not their salary, but what the show could have earned that year he wasn't in it. 

Fucking bananas"
House of Cards,Time for the judge to disappear and a Christmas video in December!
House of Cards,"Am I the only one who thinks this is quite weird? 

MRC is the producer and he's paying MRC for damages after they fired him. 
I get it, he's scum, asshole, etc. And I would be more than happy if every penny he earned was given to the victims of his misconduct. 


But paying the producers? It was their job to ensure that their production staff worked in a safe environment without harassment from someone in power. They weren't competent enough to provide that safe environment. And now they're suing someone else for it."
House of Cards,He could always join the low budget Steven Seagal movies. They would be a dynamic duo
House of Cards,He'll probably start a podcast as Frank Underwood
House of Cards,Royalties?
House of Cards,He would scoop up the Catholic Priest roles thought.
House of Cards,Celebrity boxing?
House of Cards,Maybe you would like his upcoming movie “Gore Vidal” where he plays a mentor to a young man…
House of Cards,He's worth enough that he could pay this and still live an incredibly rich and private life.
House of Cards,he’s already making new movies.
House of Cards,He could always get a job as a short order cook at dennys
House of Cards,"First two seasons were absolutely incredible. I still enjoyed it after, but I really wish they didn't ruin the shows legacy with subpar seasons and Spacey ending up being a fucking scumbag"
House of Cards,"How’s it end without him? Was there ever any like, “He killed these people?”"
House of Cards,"As a little 12 year old in 1995 Kevin Spacey cemented himself as my favorite actor (thanks to both Seven and Usual Suspects, and Swimming With Sharks that year) and I watched everything he did for decades. That motherfucker owes me at least a McChicken with everything. And I do mean **EVERYTHING**"
House of Cards,"Girl, same."

House of Cards,Do you happen to have a link to that? I'd be interested in reading that exchange
House of Cards,usually someone would not read reviews because they're insecure. explains a lot.
House of Cards,[deleted]
House of Cards,"Wait , so it was a good review? He got mad over sharing a review that was positive? Lol"
House of Cards,"Well not really, because the punitive damages phase of Jones' sentencing hasn't even started yet, and he still has at least one more defamation case ahead of him with different parents in a different state. Also he got sued for defamation, where the plaintiff's reputational damage has to be somehow quantified (before any punitive damages are added), which is not easy. By contrast, Spacey got sued for the lost profits of a hit Netflix show with a proven track record, which probably is quite easy to calculate, and would typically exceed what most individuals would get for a defamation lawsuit."
House of Cards,"""I choose to live my life as a poor man."""
House of Cards,"his best bet is to come out as a pedofile, give all his money to his victims and commit to go into intensive counseling for the rest of his life"
House of Cards,I recently saw a trailer for some MarVista or equivalent movie staring Kevin Spacey. Trying to dig it up…
House of Cards,"To which imaginary person are you talking to? You think Spacey is gonna read this?

EDIT: y'all can down vote me into oblivion, I don't understand the purpose of these kind of posts, sorry not sorry to have to point it out. 
EDIT: the reddit never changing political correct hivemind has spoken, hearing the plain, raw truths on futile attempts of gathering hordes of righteous justice warriors versus -insert wrongdoer here-, are again too confrontational and therefore invalidated."
House of Cards,"4 million today.  Sounds like it will be closer to 15 million once they add punitive damages, and that's only for one set of parents..."
House of Cards,The sums involved in major contract breaches are often larger than civil suits.
House of Cards,Just saw this. Talk about inconsistencies.
House of Cards,Nah that’s probably most of his net worth. Actors aren’t worth as much as you think. Especially when they already need to settle multiple other sexual assault cases.
House of Cards,"25 million is a lot when you are likely to never work again. Unless he has some businesses or good investments, he's in trouble. And there will likely be more lawsuits coming forward."
House of Cards,Love that movie and had such the hots for him I was 17-18... Ugh if only our paths could have crossed!
House of Cards,Curse be on your Avatar!
House of Cards,Na. Think he liked the scene with his old school mate
House of Cards,"That video was basically Kevin Spacey saying ""oh, you weren't entirely sure yet that I was a big piece of shit? Well allow me to confirm it for you."""
House of Cards,He didn’t do one last year :(
House of Cards,Why is it weird? The production company has set a code of conduct that anyone that is hired needs to follow. His contract likely has a part where he has agreed to pay damages if he breaks that code of conduct.
House of Cards,They're suing the guy who made it unsafe
House of Cards,"I agree completely bc it could be anyone of us. In fact, we are nothing to them. We are easy targets. If they can do it to him, they can do it to us."
House of Cards,I don't know. I saw [the trailer for Spacey's latest movie](https://digg.com/video/the-trailer-for-kevin-spaceys-comeback-movie-peter-five-eight-is-two-minutes-of-cringe). I think Seagal might be too good for him these days...
House of Cards,"Jesus, imagine a Cumtown video like Seagal about Spacey's low budget 'special ops' movies. Would be an amazing 10/10"
House of Cards,"He already has. I'm too lazy to look it up, but they just released a movie starring him that is Segal levels of terrible."
House of Cards,"Right, I don’t condone anything that Spacey has done - just need to make that clear…

But a podcast where he as Frank Underwood talks about the news… I’d listen to that and not tell anybody. When the people at work ask me what I’m listening to, I’d lie and say porn or something."
House of Cards,*Under the Woods*.
House of Cards,"It better be against someone that turns him into a tomato can though.

I wouldn’t pay the PPV.  But I’d watch the highlight reel on YouTube of Kevin spacey getting his nose sent back to his molars.  Sounds sorta cathartic."
House of Cards,Wasn't that made before the scandal and got cancelled?
House of Cards,Working a miserable stressed out life in back of house is *SUPER* in right now!
House of Cards,It should have ended after he banged the table at end of season 2.
House of Cards,"So true…

The first 2 seasons were great.  Great cast, writing, and the production itself was all top notch, great quality throughout and it was just an interesting creative take on that side of life — very fresh, scandalous, interesting, fun — and he was great— but maybe so because he was very much not a nice guy on the inside and so it rang true to him?

It got so ridiculous after he left and it’s my number one answer when asked what was a great show that turned out horribly, or ended horribly and its…House of Cards."
House of Cards,"I lost it when they made Robin Write the president. Like cmon, this is so contrived, I was done at that point."
House of Cards,No one knows. No one watched the final season.

All I know is I went from being a Kevin Spacey fan to jokingly/not jokingly telling people that I was going to register KevinSpaceyisadouche.com to get the word out.  So as you can imagine, I'm quite gleeful that he went and did all this shit for me so I could live out that fantasy without having to lift a finger."
House of Cards,Or an artist could be happy with what the created and don't need to read reviews. I think that's rather plausible as well.
House of Cards,lol you just made that up out of thin air
House of Cards,?
House of Cards,"I am expressing to all in here  .. 👀

Seeing who would agree or disagree with  my personal disgust. I met him, he’s predatory the way he moves around a room. 

You my imaginary friend are posting an irrelevant response. Negative, wanky and somewhat smart arse keyboard warrior kids thing. 

He’s a cunt and needs to be punished when found guilty. I don’t care if you think he will not read it, he’s still a cunt and the,  “he’s a cunt” movement will just get bigger."
House of Cards,"Yeah, and *in Texas*."
House of Cards,45.2 mil in compensatory damages - https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1555673844114939904

House of Cards,The internet pegs his net worth at about 75 million. For what that's worth.
House of Cards,"idk, he had been a big actor for decades, he will surely have at least a few million left after all of this."
House of Cards,😈
House of Cards,That video was pretty weird
House of Cards,"Ran out of ideas, no doubt."
House of Cards,"> They're suing the guy who made it unsafe
 
Who they agreed to work with and has a history of pulling this kind of stuff for so long, that *Family Guy* made a joke about it. (Joke based on him being a pervert who got beat up cottaging in the park late at night)."
House of Cards,"I mean... That trailer was awful, but have you seen any of Seagal's recent-ish movies? They're a special kind of terrible."
House of Cards,who the hell would even approve that writing/making such a horrible movie... the trailer was super-super-bad... and the plot seems to be worse than Mortal Kombat 2
The 4400,"IIRC, they introduce a few 4400 characters that stick around  for the rest of the series in s2 and s3, and maybe one or two who just stick around that season. One of them becomes a MAJOR player. It becomes more than “freak of the week” type stuff. Especially midway into season 2. I felt like the show had a decent ending too but not 100% definitive."
The 4400,I feel this show started to find its groove in season 2. There was some genuinely good character development - Billy Campbell’s performance as Jordan Collier doesn’t seem to get enough recognition.
The 4400,">so i checked this show out years ago, but didnt like it. the reason for that was it seemed like every time a new 4400 character was introduced they died that episode. i only watched i think the first season and im curious if anyone knows... if i did continue it if id experience the same thing the entire show.

>if your someone whos wondering ""why try again if u didnt like it?"" well i watched this show long before my perspective on characters in shows changed. i used to not look for character development at all it was just if i liked them right away(which depending on the show or movie was easy) then i liked them the whole show, same with dislike. now with the 4400 i simply liked a character for their ability and if they died i was so mad and thats why i quit cause so many died the episode they are introduced.

>now i may still simply like a character for their ability right away, but if i know not all will simply die THAT episode then i wont focus on the 4400 and their abilities, but rather everyone and maybe like the show.

​>so my question is: **in seasons 2-4 will a good amount of newly introduced 4400 characters last more then 1 episode or is that just how the show is the whole time and/or only very very few 4400 last a bit..?**

>P.S if your comment is JUST to convince me to watch it then please dont. if you want to answer my question AND try to convince me then thats okay.

Here's where they get to the fucking point if anyone's wondering."
The 4400,"This here, it starts off freak of the week but quickly gets into longer story arcs and is very much worth watching."
The 4400,This 👍
The 4400,And here I thought I could be verbose.
The 4400,"It could be a licensing issue? I assume the Blu-Rays were manufactured a lot longer after the DVDs were, and the cost of the music was more expensive than it previously was, or wasn't worth the cost of lower expected sales? 

It COULD also be an intentional change, but I reckon more likely a licensing issue than anything else. Music licence rights are archaic as fuck. 

I remember Scrubs had a fair bit of music changes from airing to the home media release."
The 4400,"Currently in the middle of rewatching the original USA version now. I liked it when it was first on, still not bad now. Time travel with a dash of X-Men lite.

I'm intrigued by what the new version will be like. Hopefully different enough that it doesn't feel like a rehash."
The 4400,"The kids, they love 4400"
The 4400,"All I remember about the original was that the bad guy, Jordan something? and his assistants, had the *best* suits and shirts I've ever seen. Really classy."
The 4400,Really hope this will be as good as the original
The 4400,Still mind blown that this is a thing
The 4400,Was this the SyFy show that just went on forever and they never really concluded it. I seem to remember something about an event that was going to happen but they never told us what it was. They even had an episode in the future where the event happened and they still didn’t tell the audience what it was. Characters literally said things like OH NO THE EVENT HAPPENED!
The 4400,Original was cancelled right?
The 4400,"I remember the original having a good premise and decent storyline (I liked that it wasn't aliens), but the overall execution being a bit boring. Had no idea the show was getting remade."
The 4400,"I loved this show back in the day. I went to rewatch it recently and holy shit it has aged really badly. 


Given this is CW I will be taking a hard pass."
The 4400,[deleted]
The 4400,This... Is a thing?
The 4400,"Does anyone knows if this will be produced/distributed by CBS or Warner? Want to know if it will come to HBO Max Brazil...

Edit: It seems like CBS. Sad."
The 4400,Woke
The 4400,"How often has the best character, Boom Mic, made an appearance on your rewatch? lol"
The 4400,Jesus Christ err I mean Jordan Collier
The 4400,"doubt it, and not just because it's on the cw. would be cool to have some cameos from the original show though."
The 4400,It went woke god damn CW
The 4400,"Actually, I really liked the original, I am sure they're going to 'CW this' up but it's a show I always thought should get another go around in this era of remakes and reboots"
The 4400,I believe you are referring to The Event.
The 4400,It was a CBS show. I tried to get into it but I didn't really like it. Im hoping this is different and better than the original.
The 4400,[deleted]
The 4400,"No, someone made a fake trailer to trick *you* ..."
The 4400,the Nancy Drew show was CBS and it still came to HBO Max in he states.
The 4400,Im sorry black people has you so triggered. Go cry about it elsewhere
The 4400,"Doubt that will happen.

I am so sick and tired of all these remakes, for the love of god come up with something new already."
The 4400,"CBS made the show, but it aired on USA Network."
The 4400,Thank you!
The 4400,"Here in Brazil GloboPlay service has a first-window exclusivity for most ViacomCBS TV shows or so. HBO Max BR it's getting Nancy Drew soon, but GloboPlay already has, and they will air new seasons first there.

Edit: And I think for HBO Max Latin America, they need to acquire the CBS TV shows separately, while Warner distributions, will all be on HBO Max."
The 4400,Looks like one word was all that was needed to trigger you!  Quit attacking people who have different opinions from you.
The 4400,oh i see.
The 4400,I'd been hoping for a continuation and not a reboot. I'm not going to be very interested without at least some of the great cast of the original show.
The 4400,"I really like The 4400 but I am not sure about this. So it is reboot, not a remake of same story but what kind of reboot. People use that word for many things."
The 4400,"""The 4400 reboot""

Okay. Mildly optimistic.

""By the CW""

Aw fuck"

The 4400,"Guess it's time to [""recast the whole ~~movie~~ show with ""younger, edgier versions"" of the team""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd23slMhWQU)"
The 4400,"I watched the show religiously. I was quite young at that time, not spoiled by hight quality TV, so for me it was very special. Also loved the opening song. I'd like to see it rebooted by HBO without the constraints of broadcast TV like CW."
The 4400,This makes me worried for the 100 prequel
The 4400,"Wow, I never expected this show to get a return"
The 4400,"I hope that some of the 4400 go back even further this time, like the 1900s or late 19th century. The oldest 4400 abductee in the original was from 1946, which is disappointingly recent for a concept like this, imo."
The 4400,"*‘The 4400’* . . . **Yeah?**

*Reboot* . . . **^oh...**

*Gets Straight-To-Series Order* . . . **ooh!**

*By the CW* . . . **FUCKSHITBITCHDICK!!! Whyyyy!?!**"
The 4400,"This show is the perfect fit for the CW, it had so much melodrama in it.

[The title song was a legit banger too.](https://youtu.be/KqnpwOumF4I)"
The 4400,"Sorry, the original actors is what drew me to it."
The 4400,Now do Sliders
The 4400,Was a good show....now its going to be CWed and have exsact formula and crap writing.
The 4400,Im 100% sure the  CW is a money laundering network.
The 4400,But the CW is so awful...
The 4400,[deleted]
The 4400,I didnt finish the 4400 but it does have a really interesting concept.Down for it I guess.
The 4400,"Not a fan of reboots. It sounds like writers lack creativity and imagination to come up with new shows. And when you mess with an established canon that's called Fanfiction. 

And it's the CW we're talking about here. I'll probably watch the first episode to get the feel of the series and then I'll just go back and watch the original."
The 4400,"I really really like that show, but it was a combination of great writing and a criminally underrated cast.

I think the reboot will flop *hard*.  The CW isn't known for above average writing (aside of Rob Thomas), and I doubt they'll be able to find skilled, experienced actors in their first TV series.  But, they will all be so very young and pretty."
The 4400,Jesus Christ.  Can these bums in Hollywood come up with anything original anymore?
The 4400,"Now this I'm interested in. I know it's been sold as a Battlestar-style reboot, which is good in my opinion considering how the original series ended. 

But I wonder if they can't find a use for Billy Campbell in this, love him."
The 4400,"So yeah, all the networks will be doing now is going through their back catalogues to reboot old properties so they don't have to pay anyone for new ones.

Someone at CBS Paramount going through this list and developing pitches for anything over 8 years old

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ViacomCBS_television_programs#CBS_Studios"
The 4400,"""We must have a show with numbers in the title!"""
The 4400,">The network will film at least three pilots in 2021: Diablo Cody and Berlanti Prods.’ Powerpuff Girls; Ava DuVernay and Jill Blankenship’s DC-themed Naomi; and a millennial nun dramedy from Jennie Snyder Urman, Claire Rothrock & Ryann Weir. All four projects have all-female creative teams.


Now that's progress."
The 4400,Yippee!!
The 4400,Idk if ive ever been so excited and have it dashed so quickly before.
The 4400,"Really.  A show with mediocre ratings that ended less than a decade and a half ago is being reboot?  Then again, I guess if you have the CW's lineup, mediocre ratings start looking pretty good."
The 4400,"Wow, had no idea this was happening, loved this show and shame it ended up like it did, during the writer's strike time IIRC"
The 4400,Maybe we can finally get an explanation for that theory they had early on about each person having a specific purpose that was dropped and never mentioned again.
The 4400,Loved the original I hope this will turn out good
The 4400,"Yeah...I recently read the books as continuation and they were okay but not great.   


Also opens up a brand new ""chapter"".  


I just wanted to see this story get the end it needed. I'm not sure I will watch it after the changes they made to their Roswell reboot."
The 4400,"Reboot used to have a clearly defined meaning to me, but now people call everything a reboot. 

New seasons of TV shows that come back after many years are not reboots. Gilmore Girls, Frasier, Will and Grace, Sex and the City, Animaniacs...Not reboots. 

Shows that are remakes of old shows are reboots. I think Roswell and One a Day at a Time work here, though I didn't watch either. Things like Supermarket Sweep also count. 

Restarting the Spider-Man franchise (twice) are reboots.

""Reimaginings"" can be reboots, but not always.

Spin-offs are not reboots, even if they come about years later.

I wish we could all agree to use the right words, but it will never happen. ""Reboot"" is just a cool-sounding word. Cooler than revival, or continuation, or reunion.

I can agree to some leeway when the new show doesn't fit neatly into one of these definitions. I just like words to have meanings."
The 4400,"Also, I liked the 4400 too! I don't know if it will strictly be a ""reboot"" or not. I'm interested in watching, but knowing a Riverdale exec is involved doesn't give me high hopes. 

If you liked the 4400, you might like Manifest. It is also about the mysterious reappearance of people who disappeared years ago."
The 4400,Everybody is now an abercrombie and fitch model who is also a world class genius!
The 4400,"The CW, where your show can't get cancelled."
The 4400,[deleted]
The 4400,Hasn't that been dead for a while? I thought the backdoor pilot they did didn't perform well so they killed the spinoff
The 4400,Same tbh but it’s a great concept. Hopefully they can go further with it.
The 4400,I think Mia is from early 1900.
The 4400,"It was indeed a beautiful song, and the visuals in the opening credits were sublime. I couldn't believe how filmic it looked back then on my old SD-TV. Every texture was so visceral, and every shot was so beautifully composed. Each image looked like such a real slice of life that it felt that we were peering into somebody's memories of their childhood.

I don't know if it was the song or the visuals that first grabbed my attention. I guess I can't really separate the two.

Here is the [full-length version of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvUhmMM8NUI) (nothing new is added, but they kept the repeats in so it doesn't feel as rushed). If you want to hear the song ""unplugged"" by the original singer, check out [her YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lff5wSVBOJU)."
The 4400,"I did not know any of the actors at the start of the 4400, I grew to love those actors. At best, I hope they find some new faces that I can grow to love like them.

Also, I didn't love the second half of the series....so, I guess there is room for improvement, for me at least."
The 4400,But not on CW!
The 4400,"> ...and love tetrahedrons.

I don't know why it hit me that hard, but I'm dying **:D**. Entil'zha veni!"
The 4400,"It's a lot like Heroes, including that it falls apart in the third season and attempts some crazy stuff to get back on track in the fourth."
The 4400,So what was/is the concept? the name tells me nothing.
The 4400,"Doesn't matter, they're all interested in creating content to fill up all the streaming services."
The 4400,"I'd love to see Billy Campbell pop up in this. He was great in the original as Jordan Collier, I'm pretty impressed I remembered his character's without having to look it up. I loved the original and I think this is the type of show perfect for a reboot. Each of the main 4400 can be totally new characters but I would like for them to mostly stick with the Tom, Shawn and Kyle story in some form. They could be different characters but I liked the story with them being family, Kyle being left behind, Shawn being taken and Tom investigating."
The 4400,"> Someone at CBS Paramount going through this list and developing pitches for anything over 8 years old

What would you expect from a network that specializes in programming for the geriatric set, and cop show after cop show?"
The 4400,"My answer to this is same as always, we need more scifi on tv not less. Maybe it's great, maybe it's only good, maybe it's bad. 

But I know one thing already, it's not another damn doctor/fire/police/lawyer show."
The 4400,It actually had pretty good ratings especially on USA network.
The 4400,[removed]
The 4400,Yeah I agree but let's face it without Samantha its gonna be more like no sex in the city.
The 4400,"Reboot - When Hollywood wants to make a lot of money without the hassle of creating a new movie. So they take an old movie and change just enough to make you pay for the same shit all over again.

Remake - Like a reboot where the studio doesn't care how the audience feels about the original movie, so they just keep the title, fuck up everything else, and ruin both flicks in the process."
The 4400,"First time I heard about Manifest, I just saw the trailer and it seems interesting. I am gonna check it. Thanks."
The 4400,I watched the first 3 episodes of Manifest. They were not bad but I wasnt sure if it was gonna be a one season show or even be renewed so it got lost in the pile of other shows Im overloading myself keeping up with lol. Is there any episode range where it picks up?
The 4400,And they give up on the premise of the show by the third season and go full soap opera. Still runs for another four seasons..
The 4400,Lucy Hale just read your comment and shed a tear.
The 4400,Only they did cancel a cheerleader show I enjoyed.
The 4400,"The CW, we found this at Goodwill."
The 4400,Yep. The late Monteith was playing a younger version of Mitchell.
The 4400,An article from a few weeks ago said cw was still considering. There hasn't been any news since then
The 4400,"The show wasn't the world's greatest or anything but I loved it. The concept was so interesting to late teens/young adult me. I even got the follow up novels. I did a rewatch in 2019, it still holds up for what it was. However, I couldn't find my copies of the books but did find my Dark Angel follow up ones, that's a show that would make a great reboot IMHO. Anyways, I'll check out the new one since it is such an interesting concept that they could do a lot with. My guess is that they'll go for mostly totally new characters with some being counterparts to the original show. Also, this was the show that introduced me to Mahershala Ali and I've been a fan ever since."

DreamWorks Spooky Stories: Volume 2,"I enjoyed visions so much more than that tales stuff they put out recently.

Everything in tales was so pointless and added next to nothing to the series as a whole. Oh look, ahsoka was super force sensitive from the start and controlled a tiger, and Dooku lost faith in the republic and killed Jedi. Just fascinating!... 

Visions at least was just unapologetic in creating crazy and unique stories with cool art styles and scenes that were just fun. They may not have made much sense, but they weren't trying to tie into some overall world or narrative, just great, short, self-contained stories with some cool animations behind them.

Hopefully 2 is great as well."

Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Hunter x Hunter is one of my all time favorite shows (up there with band of brothers, breaking bad, cowboy bebop, fullmetal alchemist brotherhood etc.)The chimera ant was a masterpiece rarely seeing in television."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"> A character is in a zone of comfort. He desires something and enters an unknown situation. He adapts to that situation and gets what he wanted. But, he’ll have to pay a price for it. The character returns to his old situation, having changed.

You just described the hero's journey. If you took that from Harmon's work on your own that's extremely impressive, but I think I remember he sis an interview or wrote a piece on this some time back, correct?"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Just my opinion: I  started watching HxH (2011) alongside the 1990's version with my partner recently. I abhor it, but mostly because when you compare the 2011 version to the 1990's version; there is a clear disconnect and it makes the show worse for it.
The main issue being: the 2011 version feels empty and unreasonable; gon seems to be a Mary Sue and hollow, the tall dude with black hair is such an unlikeable psychopath, the story changes from the original series feel like a colour by the numbers experience, and everything is easy too polished to the point of feeling synthetic. Seriously; watch the first 4 episodes of both side by side.

I've stopped watching now because I'm not enjoying it."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Chimera ant arc was genius. I cried a few times too. 
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"The writing is just that damn good. I was asking myself plenty of times ""Is this really happening right now?""

It starts out so innocent and adventurous and it goes deeper and deeper into that unique world but in the end it's just a story about life and human nature.





"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Chimera arc is the greatest arc of any anime, ever."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Just wait for 2021 HxH when there will be dozens of  new episodes from the source materiel..
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Spoilers ahead.

The old version is really dated and not animated very well imo. I watched it and it doesn't compare to the 2011 version at all imo. I also don't see how Gon is a Mary Sue. He would be a Gary Stue, the male version. He literally doesn't do everything perfect. He's a super flawed person which makes him an interesting protagonist. He's called a beast early on and his master fears him. Later in the story he goes off the rails with his vendetta against Pitou and becomes the monster he hates. He even takes Komugi hostage to get what he wants. He almost kills himself to be able to fight Pitou. He does other flawed things along the way like deviating from a plan to fight Genthru and his loses his arm. It was established very early that he is insane. 

You also called him an unlikable psychopath. So I don't see how he is a Gary or Mary. I also don't see how it's a by the numbers story. Togashi crafted the most unique shonen I've ever seen. The Chimera Ant Arc is the most unique shonen arc I've ever seen. I also can't see it's hollowness with the amazing characters, story development, character development, art, animation, direction and music it has. It's a vibrant and unique world. From their language, the boardgame Meruem and Komugi play, Nen's structure and many other things. It's all so well thought out by Togashi.





"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Without spoiling: that arc took a turn I never would've expected.

But that could be said about the whole story and all the character development. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Dark Tournament arc in Yu Yu Hakusho (same creator as HxH) hm
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"They should do seasons like other anime do nowadays. 

Wait until there's enough material and release something of 11 or 26 or whatever episodes. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"
Hunter x Hunter. I love Avatar The Last Airbender but Hunter X hunter made me cry. I was way more invested on it, it has better antagonist by far and a more dynamic power system. Also Killua."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"It's tough. I feel like in character development, Hunter X Hunter has done more. The emotional journey that Gon and Killua go on is hard to compare with others. That's not to say there isn't any development in Avatar but it just isn't at the level of Hunter X Hunter. 

With that said, Avatar wraps things up in the final episode better. I feel the main reason for this is that with Hunter X Hunter still has more material. 

All things considered, I have to give the edge to Hunter X Hunter"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Based on nothing but my own opinion Hunter x Hunter
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I've watched both and to me Avatar the Last Airbender is much better. While Hunter X Hunter has arcs and moments that are better than Avatar, it does also have a lot of shitty arcs (like that god awful video game arc)."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Watched a few seasons of Hunter X Hunter and I would say the pacing is way better in ATLA.  HXH drags at points with no end in sight.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"The Last Airbender, no comparison. 

Hunter x Hunter is a very generic shonen anime, it doesn't really do anything original or special, it's just a good addition to a well trod genre. It gets worse as it goes on, with the Chimera Ant arc being terribly slow and drawn out, like they had caught up to the manga and needed to extend things out and wait for more source material. It also doesn't really have an ending, instead it just runs out of material after the main character finally encounters someone teased throughout the whole series. 

The Last Airbender is perhaps the best American cartoon ever made and got better with each season. It has a great sense of humor and amazing relationship building between the characters. It tells a serious and complex story, but knows to never take itself too seriously. It has fight scenes that can compete with the best shonen, but has much better dialogue, humor, heart, and characterizations. It never feels like it is drawing things out or running too long, it is a steady progression towards a satisfying culmination."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Hunter X Hunter FAR BETTER, the strategy, creativity, and  storytelling are all on another level"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Nothing satisfied me like Hunter X Hunter did. It might have some pacing issues, but overall, its a very satisfying experience I still can't get anywhere. Avatar is awesome in its own rights, but again, I wasn't as satisfied as I was after completing HxH."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"People hype up a series that will likely never finish. The narrator has to explain every waking moment to HXH viewers like as if they were still being spoonfed.

 Kite being reincarnated killed and ultimately invalidated Gon's big moment with Pitou and his character development.

Killua carries the show on the protagonist side. Leorio is irrelevant and Kurapika comes by once in a while. He's more involved in the current manga but then again Togashi hasn't made a new chapter in like a year. 

Yorknew is the best arc, not chimera ant. The phantom troupe lived up to the build up. Killua's family arc was good nothing really special and heavens arena is the 2nd best arc. 

ATLA is more consistent, the plot was executed amazingly, we learn so much about ba sing se in just a few episodes. The themes of cultural preservation and the whole brainwash conspiracy was well put together. 
Most of all, Zuko's character development is one of the best writing ever. 

ATLA > HXH"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I love both shows but I have to give this one to ATLA. HXH pacing is inferior to ATLA, the Chimera Ant arc was dreadful in the beginning but became really good over time. Both have some of the best world building and story telling in any show. Both have amazing sound tracks too. HXH has better animation than ATLA but it isn't by much."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Greed island was great
Hunter X Hunter (2011),I don't think so
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"> Hunter x Hunter is a very generic shonen anime

You haven't watched a lot of shonen anime then. HxH is far from generic Shonen anime."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),You obviously did not watch hunter x hunter
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"You know HxH is old right, they definitely were original when it came out. If you're actually trying to say that the same person who created Yu Yu Hakusho isn't doing anything original with his work you must not pay attention"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),">tells a serious and complex story, but knows to never take itself too seriously.

sounds like you don't understand stakes of story-telling and you seem to prefer the childlike perpetuity of superficial content that is avatar, your comment shows that you aren't informed on anything hxh and/or have watched it without paying any attention, your opinion is forfeit"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Seriously bruhh your calling Hunterxhunter a generic shonen, your just an Avatar fan boy, Avatar is even way more generic than Hunterxhunter, a boy is given a great strength to save the people against the greatest evil something, I swear I've seen this story thousands of times not to mention the villain is generic, he doesn't even have an actual reason for his destruction he just does staff and no development at all, I wouldn't even call him 1 dimension, and you talk about pacing saying it's better hahah don't make me laugh 60% of the plot just felt like filler episodess and also the comedy in Avatar is childish, have you actually try watching it as an adult?, The fights in Hunterxhunter are more emotional and better executed, Avatar isn't even in my top 30 animes, Ang is lame protagonist he acts all goody goody saying he can't kill the fire Lord, even though he let the combustion jackass get blown to ashes and didn't even show any feelings of detest towards that, azula never seem to have a goal but just to torture others, am like how you people calling this a masterpiece and comparing it to shows like Naruto or what's more you say it's better than Hunterxhunter, Hunterxhunter's pacing was at the right quality every episode didn't feel out of line, it was part of the main stories in each arc"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"It's really not. Avatar: TLA was far more consistent and better paced, its execution was done a lot better as well.

I get that these are your opinion, saying HxH is far better but look at the actual quality. Avatar: TLA is a lot better written. Not to mention Avatar features one of the greatest character arcs in any fiction media."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I had the same feeling as them though.

>  it's just a good addition to a well trod genre. 

\^The part of the sentence we quoted that I focused on.  
I really enjoyed HxH, but when I read the thread I thought 'HxH is more of a shonen, and ATLA is.... idk'.

I don't think one has to be better than the other, but I'd say ATLA is 'better' and HxH is more fun."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),It is really tropey and trash in the beginning for a newb tbh.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I've watched a lot of shonen anime, and I honestly would also say that HxH is very generic. A lot of people keep saying it's the least tropey shonen ever, but to me it just feels like a combination of all kinds of different shonen tropes.

The perfect example is Gon, who is THE most generic shonen main character I've seen."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Yeah the guy is just another Avatar fan boy who thinks Avatar is better than everything, like seriously what's the complexity about a boy being destined to defeat the greatest evil, what's more most of the subplots are even better than the main story, I don't get why Avatar fans condescend such an average cartoon and tend to compare it to the awesome animes saying Avatar is better"

Hunter X Hunter (2011),[deleted]
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Na man hxh both 2011and 1999 are definitely better written in quality but I'll respect your opinion
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Good pacing and execution you say.... even though 60% of the episodes felt like filler, I think no villain in ATLB can beat chimera king interms of character development, except for zuko"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"i’m not gonna lie i thought the pacing during portions of part 3 were horrible, it lacked urgency at many points despite the fact that the deadline to fight Sozin was coming closer and closer. I think overall whole part 3 had some very standout episodes but there were several moments where I was really taken out of it, and overall I think part 2 was better. Also the first half of part 1 was ass"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),the very first season yes but the other seasons no
Hunter X Hunter (2011),I'd never even heard of that show. I'm guessing it doesn't get brought up a lot because it's anime. Personally I have a hard time watching anime. Live action stuff tends to be much more popular and easier to access for American audiences in general.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),One of the best anime of all time
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Great anime. I noticed that there was a surprising high number of arms that get broken or flat out dismembered in the show though. Just a random thing
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I don't watch anime much either, only one I've watched that's really famous is One-Punch man, which I thought was really good but didn't make me go ""Oh yeah, anime's awesome, I should watch a lot more of it!"" like I was told I'd feel like. 

I watched 10 mins of this video and it honestly doesn't appeal to me. It had a mind numbing amount of exposition (Which apparently is something most animes have, I personally can't stand it), the fight scenes looked very similar (Big explosions, mountains and rocks getting destroyed, special moves and twist moves, big muscled monsters/guys getting destroyed by really small/tiny people) to One-Punch Man's but not as good and these are supposed to be some of the best ones this show has ever done (And I've heard Hunter X Hunter is supposed be really good). Only anime I've heard of (seen random clips of) that I feel like watching is Attack on Titan which I just haven't gotten around to yet. And maybe I'll watch OPM season 2 when that's out, not sure."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Wow, ya everyother person loses and arm haha"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"You should check out Death Note, it's brilliant. Get to the end of the 2nd episode, if you don't like it then feel free to bail."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Death Note and Steins;Gate are the only anime I can stand as an avid fan of live action television.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Most of mine stopped airing when I was under 10
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"It's actually a blessing.  You get to binge-watch an entire season in a few days while fans had to wait a week for the next episode.  Since you didn't pay attention during its run, you don't have to worry about people dropping spoilers each week between episodes.  Unless you watch or follow shows to be part of something trendy (e.g., Wandavision), you should consider yourself very fortunate to stumble on an old show that you enjoy."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Yeah, there’s a lot of great shows and movies that I catch up with many years later. It means I miss out on the conversation around them that happens when they are released. But there is just so much coming out all the time. Even 20 years ago it was more than I could keep up with. So, I don’t let it bother me."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I'm the same age as you and feel the same. I feel like the main reason would be we were too young when the golden age of TV was going on.

And right now there aren't many beat of all time shows on air.  There are a few amazing ones but they are just starting out, like succession, Ozark. Also BCS is pretty underrated, and it is for sure gonna be a classic like Sopranos in the near future."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),I bet you haven't watched Schitt's Creek yet. That should be next on your list.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Thank goodness I found a post to relate to even though it is a bit old. I am really thinking about this when it comes to Pokémon because the final episode to have Ash and Pikachu as the protagonists will be airing next week as of the writing of this post. I honestly can't help but envy the people who kept up with the show since the beginning in 1997 or are up to date through means such as binge-watching.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Exactly. It almost feels more personal as an experience, like it's your secret little world away from reality. Or a secret time machine to the past."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I think the last season of Better Call Saul was actually really good, even if it borrowed a bit too much from Ozymandius. As someone who couldn't get into it for the first four seasons, I thought Season 5 was a step in the right direction, and I can see them planting the seeds for something remarkable in the final season. I have a feeling it's gonna be amazing.

Haven't seen Succession or Ozark but I'm looking forward to watching them soon and I'll let you know what I think."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),I'll check it out soon!
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Definitely looking forward to hearing your opinion when you do
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Really good show, lots of people here will tell you no but that’s just because there are some questionable moments. 

Definitely watch it though, I love it, it’s one of my favourites."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"> Reverse Flash is one of the best super villains in a long time

I can agree with that. He is definitely among the best ones. However, that TV show hasn't done anything special since the first season and now it's a shadow of its former self."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),lmao if you sat through 5 seasons of supernatural you'll probably love the flash.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Reverse Flash being one of the best supervillains in a long time is the only truthful thing you heard.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I first watched Arrow, which was pretty good for the first couple seasons. Arrow is darker than The Flash, similar to Daredevil (definitely my favorite comic book hero show and one of my favorite shows of all time.)

The Flash is lighter but I really liked season 1. It is not as good after that but I still watch it. Tons of good stuff in season 1 including Reverse Flash and general relationships with Barry. I also don't think there is much filler in season 1. When a conflict comes up between characters it is resolved pretty quickly and not teased for episode after episode like most shows and frankly like later seasons of The Flash."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Season 1 is really good

Season 2 I think is also really good not as good as season 1, but still out there.

I’m not a fan of what follows."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Hell no! The writing is terrible and showrunners keep using the same story rhythms.  Watch Doom Patrol, trust me."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),[deleted]
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Excellent show easy story to follow
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I think you'll like it. I did.
One critique. 
His gf was way too hot for him to go as slow as he did. I mean, he IS the flash"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Seasons 1-3 are good, watch those. Quit after that."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),How so?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"So, pretty much just season 1 is worth it?"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Why not?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Oh, alright. I'll give that a try. Thanks."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Showrunners have been using the same storyline for three seasons with superficial changes. Main character doesn't have any noticable development. In my experience, watching second and third seasons was like watching bad filler stories non-stop. Flash doesn't differ from who he was by the end of the first season. No progression, no changes and no excitement. Just a routine."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I would say season 1 is absolutely worth it. After that you can decide for yourself. If you like season 1 then at least go through season 2 before deciding if you'd like to stop there. It depends how many shows you watch and what quality of show you consider worth your time.  The only active shows that I watch (typically on demand) are The Good Place, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Arrow, and The Flash. I also just started watching the 2nd season of The Punisher. So in general I have cut down the number of shows I watch in the last couple years, but I have kept The Flash on that list. If you watch The Flash, I would also try to watch the first couple seasons of Arrow. Barry (The Flash) actually starts off as a character on Arrow."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I think Season 3 is a little Shark Jumping, it has a good premise, but it doesn’t really follow through in my view.  

Season 4, well it tried to give us something different, and again a good premise with a good villain, but It doesn’t land well.  

Season 5 so far is okay, better than the previous two seasons, and they’ve set up a lot of intriguing things, but the main plot is still not that great."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),I'll second that. I'd also like to add that the CW is relatively safe television imho. You won't see them taking very many risks at that network with their DC characters. Would have been interesting to see this show on the new DC stream service.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Isn't Nen just 「Stands」 stolen from JoJos Bizzare Adventure Part 3~?


The only thing I like about Hunter Hunter is the vow because while it's a Deus Ex Machina I like the idea of sacrificing all future power in exchange for a burst right now. I'm sure it's ruined in the manga because he probably gets his power back but within the context of that episode it was good.


Anyway watch JoJo."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I dunno, I think parts of it make no sense to me. I've not watched the whole show, just a few key fights. But say Gon vs Pitou yeah?

Gon ain't normally as strong as Pitou, but he's real angry so he enters a contract to temporarily become way stronger and win the fight, in exchange for severe drawbacks later.

So why does EVERYONE who's about to lose not do this? Why would that not be the go to last ditch effort from everyone who's about to die? It's not like the consequences could be too severe if they're about to die anyway.

"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),where can i watch this?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I agree with you. I think HxH is so good that there'll inevitably be a live action adaptation for it in our lifetimes. There simply has to be, as there's always money to be made from great stories. Give it 20 years or so."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Devil Fruits from One Piece are better in my opinion.you are gambling a lot of the time with what power you get since not all DFs are catalogued.the powers have two very specific weaknesses, with one being something that takes up like 90% of the planet. The strength of the powers comes from creativity. There are natural strengths like how magma > fire. The powers are usually based in real world things or prominent mythology,  that are super easy to comprehend, unlike how insanely complicated Nen powers can be at times."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I've watched JoJo until episode 24 or something. It was fun, but it didn't really kept me wanting more. I'll probably return to it eventually. From what I've seen from Hamon so far it isn't fleshed out as much as Nen. I'm sure Togashi drew a lot of inspiration from Hamon.. and made it different and bigger. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Because they want to live?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Not everyone is as resolved or strong willed as Gon. It was set-up throughout the series how stubborn, simple and strong willed Gon was while having iffy morality. All of that combined with the loss of Kite: someone who he cared deeply about. He met Kite at a young age and he set him on the path of becoming a Hunter. He looked up to Kite and due to his loss Gon directed all of his anger to the one that killed him. It wasn't just a last ditch effort. He kept building it up all to the point where it culminated against Pitou, after it made it clear that it couldn't bring Kite back. Gon snapped and used a vow and limitation to use all of his aura up.  Also the vow led to Gon losing his Nen.  

Kurapika for example was only able to become so strong vs. the Spiders because of his vengeance (plus Specialization due to the Scarlet Eyes of course) but his power to contain the Spiders was all through his will and focus. Something Gon also had vs. Pitou. A Knuckle for example couldn't have pulled the same off against Youpi. He didn't have the same determination. Someone's character has a lot of influence on their Nen as depicted throughout the series. Knuckle saw a humanity in Youpi at the end and even backed down and couldn't even see him as an enemy anymore. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Crunchyroll 
Hunter X Hunter (2011),I respectfully disagree. Nen gives the writer more freedom for creativity while still having rules set in place. With devil fruit you all have the same drawback: not being able to swim. While Nen can go in all kinds of directions. I've seen a video essay about it that explained it perfectly. 
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Hamon reminds me more of Hokuto Shinken than Nen. Also Hamon was only featured mostly in Season 1. Season 2 onwards is a whole new ballgame and where things get crazy.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Do they? Somebody is trying to kill you, succeeding, and you have a trump card in your back pocket, you just leave it there? Does not seem like you want to live to me."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"That just explains why somebody would not become AS strong as Gon if they tried it.

But why would they not try it? Why would anyone in a losing fight to the death not try to make some extreme vow?
"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),What’s the point of living if only to die slowly and more painfully later when the effects of the contract begin?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Because, like I tried to explained and failed at it, not everyone can make a nen contract because of different circumstances. Gon was only possible to pull it off due to who he was and his intense hatred for Pitou. 

Imagine Shoot vs. Meruem. Shoot wouldn't be able to do a vow like Kurapika or Gon did because his hatred for Meruem wouldn't be as intense as Kurapika's hate for the troupe or Gon's hate for Pitou.

Kurapika lost his whole clan, all of his loved ones. That led him to his chain that no Troupe member could break out of. If he used it on anyone else he would've died. That's a condition and vow no other character on the show could've used because none of them hated the troupe like Kurapika did. He was on a quest for vengeance, fueled by it. Gon was fueled by his hate towards Pitou, who had hurt someone he deeply loved. Gon went nuts. 

Random character A vs random character b in a duel to death without all of that hatred and build-up can't amount to the same level of vow. 

Togashi took the shonen troupe of rage power boosts like in Dragon ball and built rules within it so not every character could just pull it off. There's a lot of consequence to it and there are steps needed to get to it.

Same reason why Netero used a bomb in his heart instead of a vow against Meruem.

The hatred is also based on focus and extreme power of will. 
Edit: and oh yeah, Gon also had extreme potential. That was also really important. Gon basically aged himself to the point where his potential came to fruition. Not every Nen user has that potential. Gon's potential was hinted at throughout the series. 
Killua also has lots of potential. So he COULD pull off a vow that like IF he had the focus of extreme will and hatred towards someone. Lets say someone kills Alluka and he goes on a dark path of vengeance. But if it was just a fight for his life against a random strong Nen user... it's highly doubtful he could pull such a powerful nen contract off. 
"
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Living.
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"I guess that's convincing to you. To me it's just an arbitrary and convenient deus ex machina. 

This is not a critique of the show, magic is by definition impossible, so of course it's difficult to make it internally consistent in fiction. It's just a critique of the idea that the system is particularly mind boggling. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),For a few more days?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),">I've not watched the whole show, just a few key fights.

I don't get what you are getting at. First you say you haven't watched the show... just a few key fights. You proceed to ask questions. I go ahead and try to explain the logic behind Nen which was EXPLAINED mostly throughout the show and not during the fights. But you won't accept the explanation. How are you going to critique an idea I have about the show which I based on the whole show while you just have watched ''key fights''. Which is even stranger seeing how HxH mostly isn't even about the fights, had Nen being set-up outside the fights and Nen having also different kinds of applications outside of fights. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"Yes?

You're given the choice between instant death, or giving up half your life expectancy in exchange for avoiding instant death, and you choose instant death? Come on man."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"""But you won't accept the explanation.""

Correct. I read what you wrote, cross referenced with things like the HxH wikia, and formed my own opinion.

I think you know exactly what I'm getting at. Not like I've been vague."
Hunter X Hunter (2011),Ok I see what’s going on here. You don’t understand nen contracts like the on Gon used do you?
Hunter X Hunter (2011),"&#x200B;

Yup, just trying to be a contrarian towards something you haven't even fully watched. 

Go watch, come back and then tell me how Nen isn't a great power system. "
Hunter X Hunter (2011),........
Hunter X Hunter (2011),No.
Two and a Half Men,I didn't realise until Cryer tweeted it last week that they were both in Hot Shots together.
Two and a Half Men,"Crazy that Cryer is older than Charlie Sheen, shows you what alcohol and drug abuse does to your body 

The fact Lorre and Cryer both say Charlie when he was sober was great to work with and a joy to be around makes it even sadder that he went back to substance abuse after his marriage fell apart and that being sober was a big deal for Sheen, anyone who’s known an addict knows it’s not something they want to happen"
Two and a Half Men,Charlie looks pretty good there. Old photo?
Two and a Half Men,[deleted]
Two and a Half Men,I bet Sheen was a blast until he totally lost it.
Two and a Half Men,Sheen was walking around with a briefcase full of cocaine and paying pornstars to fuck him in Vegas.  Dude was a little more than off the rails.
Two and a Half Men,"This is a very unpopular show on this website and thus the following opinion will also fall flat, but:

The first five seasons of this show are infinitely rewatchable and are objectively good. It's an interesting time capsule, perhaps the last sitcom with jokes that today wouldn't fly, and Holland Taylor's performance as narcissist Evelyn is peerless."
Two and a Half Men,They figured out how much cocaine Charlie sheen was doing- it was enough to kill two and a half men
Two and a Half Men,"I fucking loved this show. It was hilarious, rude and so goddamn stupid. I was devastated when they killed off Charlie. I don’t think I watched a single episode past his funeral."
Two and a Half Men,Pretty sure it was being ON rails that did it.
Two and a Half Men,"Cryer was in a movie where an adult was hiding out as a high school student with his nephew, because the mafia was after him. Its funny and worth watching."
Two and a Half Men,"Damn shame, 2 & a half men had a great run with these two."
Two and a Half Men,"New Hot Shots anyone , anyone ?"
Two and a Half Men,Not used to seeing Cryer bald. Not a terrible look
Two and a Half Men,I still watch this show with Charlie almost every night on antenna TV. So funny!
Two and a Half Men,they absolutely can end the show with Charlie if they wanted. the Walden years felt like fever dream anyway
Two and a Half Men,"Yeah, addicts are generally like that."
Two and a Half Men,"And you can tell - the reason the series blew up in the first place was because in the first seasons, Cryer and Sheen had an absolute amazing chemistry. They fed off each other beautifully and the timing of the deliveries on both sides was impeccable. Up until season 4, maybe 5, it was as perfect as sitcom comedy can get."
Two and a Half Men,Looking like Lars from futurama
Two and a Half Men,I keep forgetting that the dude who killed it as Lex Luthor on the CW was the dude from Two and a Half Men. Incredible actor
Two and a Half Men,I almost forgot I watched it.
Two and a Half Men,ducky always
Two and a Half Men,Maxwell Houser?
Two and a Half Men,I still don't understand how a jingle writer was able to get so many women.
Two and a Half Men,"In reference to the writing, making Cryer’s character a Flanderized mooch didn’t help the show either."
Two and a Half Men,I'm genuinely surprised that reddit thinks this show was great but shits on Big Bang Theory.
Two and a Half Men,The show went off the rails cuz Charlie was off them rails
Two and a Half Men,"No one is ever going to get paid what Charlie sheen was paid an episode.  Ever

It's history.   Charlie sheen is going to be in the history of television forever.   

The last highest paid actor per episode."
Two and a Half Men,I don't believe a word that comes from Lex Luther's mouth.
Two and a Half Men,"Going off the rails, doing rails more like"
Two and a Half Men,"I used to love it. Then they killed of Charlie, and everything turned to shit!"
Two and a Half Men,He in fact went on the rails.
Two and a Half Men,I think going ON the rails was the problem
Two and a Half Men,Dude looks fucking hansom as fuck bald
Two and a Half Men,I wish we got 10 full seasons before Charlie went crazy
Two and a Half Men,"Oh man Charlie Sheens melt down, that was a fucking time. How innocent we were?"
Two and a Half Men,I bet the two Corey’s wouldn’t say the same.
Two and a Half Men,Cryer said in interviews before that it was difficult to watch somebody he considered a friend make those kind of choices. Holland Taylor and Melanie Lynskey said Sheen was always professional. Lorre probably made a bad call publicly maligning someone who was both a popular actor's kid and both experienced and famous enough to have been his own brand for multiple decades; if he hadn't let his personality get in the way there would have either been an agent or a publicist holding Lorre and CBS accountable for disparaging principal cast.
Two and a Half Men,It’s a better show than Friends.
Two and a Half Men,"The problem with Charlie is he’s a likable fun guy,"
Two and a Half Men,"I wish they  would addressed how Alan maybe ended up rich in the end. As I recall, Alan played peacemaker between Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher) and his estranged friend and former partner, Olswalt Patton. They ended working together again and as I recalled it, Walden gave Alan a very small stake in their new venture. Would'nt it be nice in the final episode, Walden tells moocher Alan that he is actually rich."
Two and a Half Men,"I never watched that show, but they are both fantastic in the movie Hot Shots"
Two and a Half Men,He didn’t go off the rails. He was just a Rockstar from Mars that was misunderstood.
Two and a Half Men,"I didn't watch the show until it was long over and then I binged every episode.  I loved every second of it. That said you could see Charlie's decline leading up to his feud with Chuck Lorre 

I even loved the Ashton Kutcher years

If you ever get a chance, watch ""Anger Management"" the series.  IMO Charlie got back to the things that made him great and it had a great cast"
Two and a Half Men,"This is one of the old sitcoms I’ll watch to relax, along with The Nanny and King of Queens. The actors are so good that you forget the serious issues they went through (Sheen, Drescher and Remini)."
Two and a Half Men,Charlie was fucking great in Two and a Half Men.
Two and a Half Men,"If anyone is considering sobriety or wants a community for sobriety, r/stopdrinking is a really amazing place for people to connect!"
Two and a Half Men,The rapist charlie sheen? No way
Two and a Half Men,I noticed that sheen's face taking a hit in the beginning of season 6. Man got worse after that.
Two and a Half Men,"Men, let this be a lesson to you: women love hot bald guys with beards."
Two and a Half Men,Rails… pun intended.
Two and a Half Men,"Lol this reminds me of that movie Due Date with RDJ and Zack Galápagos Islands. 

(I’m not even gonna look it up, I like my version better.)"
Two and a Half Men,Oh wow
Two and a Half Men,Pretty fucked up hearing people talk about mental illness like that. My dude had a complete breakdown and people still treat it like a joke
Two and a Half Men,"Fuck that disease spreading, woman beating bastard & his unfunny show."
Two and a Half Men,"Wait, Alan Harper and Lex Luthor were played by the same actor? Damn, I’ve watched both two and a half men and supergirl and I had no clue until now."
Two and a Half Men,"I’ve enjoyed watching both of these guys work. I watched them both as kids in the 80s. Why is this a story? Is one of them running for office, or up for a Nobel? Are they even working? Edit: reading the comments folks are all remembering fun stuff. But the story… yup, Sheen is an addict. We know that. Fun stuff People mag."
Two and a Half Men,"4th season is when the show absolutely becomes a shitfest.  


It stops being funny, and everyone becomes a clown (cept for Bertha, god bless her)."
Two and a Half Men,Cryer me a river
Two and a Half Men,The night first episode of 2 and a half men aired is closer to the release of Ferris Bueller than it is to today… times flyin’
Two and a Half Men,This show was genuinely awful and Charlie Sheen is a garbage human.
Two and a Half Men,"Job Cryer ruined the show, he is genuinely not funny and a horrible actor, the show went to utter shit after Sheen left and Ashton took over."
Two and a Half Men,"In largely unrelated news.. in a nationwide exit poll of first time audiences to motion-picture “Blow”, a statistically significant proportion of audience members associate rollicking good times and gleeful moments with the first 60 minutes of the picture, as opposed to
The final 83 minutes."
Two and a Half Men,Who gives a shit?
Two and a Half Men,100 out of 100 times I’d still rather hang out with Charlie.
Two and a Half Men,He need some aids
Two and a Half Men,Guy spent his entire career riding on Charlie's coat tails. It's understandable he'd be upset that his gravy train left the station.
Two and a Half Men,Why did Jon Cryer go cue ball? Ew.
Two and a Half Men,Dude raped Corey haim
Two and a Half Men,[deleted]
Two and a Half Men,Cryer is a complete jackass.
Two and a Half Men,"Dang, Carlos done made him go bald!"
Two and a Half Men,Of course
Two and a Half Men,I care more about that photo and finding out he’s bald now.
Two and a Half Men,Gah ducking love that era good laughs I gotta Rewatch next shroom trip
Two and a Half Men,That explains why he literally turned into Lex Luthor
Two and a Half Men,Where’s Sheen these days?  Is he still winning?
Two and a Half Men,That’s a whole lotta foreheads right there 😂
Two and a Half Men,Holy shit he looks exactly like egghead with a beard!
Two and a Half Men,OLD NEWS
Two and a Half Men,"Not going to lie, I fucking love this show as a filler in the background while I'm trying to sleep/on my phone before sleeping."
Two and a Half Men,I genuinely believe that charlie sheen might've had a good personality behind that coke and liquor brain-fried mind.
Two and a Half Men,Addiction is a real bitch. Glad he survived
Two and a Half Men,"I love this funny, even zany series."
Two and a Half Men,Herb (Ryan Stiles) is also in Hot Shots
Two and a Half Men,Washout! How’s the walleye vision?
Two and a Half Men,Valeria Golino.
Two and a Half Men,Washout! Heh Yeap
Two and a Half Men,"Odd how I didn't realize that, but the moment I read your comment I *immediately* saw him as Washout."
Two and a Half Men,Did you never see the movie?
Two and a Half Men,He will always be Washout to me
Two and a Half Men,"While sober, my brother was the absolute best person to be around. Hilarious, understanding, polite, etc. There wasn’t anyone I’d rather have in my corner, not even close. The issue was, during those 15 years he struggled, the times he was sober were few and far between. While he was using, there was no one I hated more. I’ll live out the rest of my days wondering what could’ve been."
Two and a Half Men,The worst thing about it is that Jon and Charlie are the same age yet Charlie looks much older. Genetics could play a role but I’m sure decades of drug abuse didn’t help.
Two and a Half Men,"This is hard for me. My brother and my dad are great, charming guys when they are sober. But they also do a lot of stupid, really illegal and awful stuff when they aren't. They are both sober so little of the time that I truly don't know who they really are sober."
Two and a Half Men,"I would love to change that language just a little bit-he didn’t go back to substance dependence after his marriage fell apart, his relationships consistently fall apart because of his substance dependence and reckless behavior.

A relationship recap: Sheen shot fiancé Kelly Preston (RIP) in the arm and she broke off their relationship. Sheen’s first marriage fell apart because he was found to be the client of an escort agency. Denise Richards filed for divorce *while pregnant with their younger daughter* because of his substance abuse (among other issues, like allegations about what he was keeping on his compjter.) Sheen and his third wife consistently abused substances throughout their marriage and he completely went off the rails toward the end of the marriage. 

Substance dependence is a disease and we can have empathy and sympathy for people who suffer from it but we have to also hold them accountable for abusive behavior that occurs during that time. If someone is abusive while they are dependent on substances, it doesn’t excuse the abuse."
Two and a Half Men,"Speaking from experience, as an addict, you're ALWAYS an addict, even if you're not actively taking substances. 

The absolute worst part about it all is that you're very self aware of it. You know it's a problem. You know you're hurting yourself and others. You know you're lying to your loved ones, and this chews you up inside. 

We don't want to be addicts, but we're basically on autopilot, and watching ourselves as it happens. 

You can't escape addiction, but you can learn to work around it."
Two and a Half Men,"He was doing hard drugs *during* the marriage.  I sure that’s part of the reason it fell apart.

That and, you know, threatening to kill his wife with a knife."
Two and a Half Men,People age differently lol and besides he looks older than sheen in the image
Two and a Half Men,"I saw Sheen on his meltdown tour after it was polished up a bit.  It was a shit show, but he was a pretty funny and honest guy.  Guy was in California for a court hearing earlier in the day and flew all the way back to DC to make the show (he was an hour late).   That kind of speaks to who he is in my opinion.  

Most performers probably would have said screw it and canceled.  I think Sheen really loved his fans."
Two and a Half Men,Apparently when sober the Sheen/Esteves family are great all around!
