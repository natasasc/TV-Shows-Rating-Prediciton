Rick and Morty,">Roiland’s exit is not expected to impact the hit series, which will continue.

""Hey, Rick, why do we sound different all of a sudden?""

""You know why, Morty."""
Rick and Morty,"""I have to go now.  My planet needs me.""

Rick and Morty died on the way back to their home planet."
Rick and Morty,You know who haven’t had charges filed against them? Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick
Rick and Morty,"I guess there will be an episode with an accident involving acidic gas which damages Rick and Morty's vocal chords.

Edit:

Actually it's gonna be like this: Rick's alcoholism caused acid reflux, which will end up in Reflux laryngitis - damaged vocal chords. And Morty? Ever heard of puberty?

Guys - the setup has been there all along - this was planned from the very beginning."
Rick and Morty,"Rick and Morty will continue without Roiland:

>Adult Swim has ended it's association with Justin Roiland.  
 
>Rick and Morty will continue. The talented and dedicated crew are hard at work on Season 7

Roiland will be recast and the show is still locked in through Season 10.

Hulu is probably gonna end up doing the same thing with Solar Opposites, but they’ve been silent so far.

EDIT: this was the original headline from Deadline, they changed it."
Rick and Morty,"Ooh wee. Mr. Poopybutthole is going to have a lot to talk about next season…

…Once they find him a voice."
Rick and Morty,"Ex-prosecutor here with an analysis of the charges. The [indictment](https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Roiland-complaint.pdf) is very short and does not provide any details regarding the specifics of the alleged crime beyond a date, so take this with a grain of salt, I'm doing a bit of speculating here (this is fairly typical, indictments tend to be only a few pages).

That said, you don't get charged with felony domestic violence for a simple spat that turns physical, most such cases (which comprise the vast bulk of DV cases) are charged as misdemeanors; in other words, they are only punishable by up to a year in the county jail. People only get charged with felony DV, which is punishable by up to five years in *prison* in most states (four in California), when the domestic violence seriously injures the victim (the state where I currently live uses the terminology of ""malicious wounding""). In California (Cal. Pen. Code § 273.5), the equivalent description is ""willfully inflict\[ing\] corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition."" ""Traumatic condition"" is defined as an internal or external wound  or other bodily condition caused by particular force. The statute puts a specific emphasis on strangulation as one such a ""traumatic condition."" To put it more simply, Justin Roiland is alleged to have injured the victim enough such that she has or had detectable injuries and possibly to have strangled her given the emphasis in the law. In a number of other states, assault with a physical implement also qualifies as felony DV but this doesn't appear to be the case in California.

As for the false imprisonment charge. The scope of false imprisonment as both a tort and a crime is wider than most people realize. You don't have to lock a person in a confined space to be guilty of false imprisonment. If you lie to someone and tell them that there is something horrible outside of the space to keep them confined, or threaten violence if they leave the space and the threat is credible enough that the person complies, both would result in a charge of false imprisonment; even if the door or other entry to the space was completely unlocked and the victim was physically ""free"" to leave. The specific charge here (Cal. Pen. Code § 236) is a lazy (typical of the California legislature) codification of the common law crime and therefore does not provide much detail on specific elements, relying instead on precedent to fill in the gaps. He is alleged to have effected the false imprisonment by ""violence, menace, fraud, and deceit."" This law (Cal. Pen. Code § 237(a)) , as written, is usually a misdemeanor but has been escalated to a felony using the sentencing guidelines in Cal. Pen. Code § 1170(h). Given the nature of the charges, I am guessing he likely kept the victim confined for the time by threatening her with additional violence if she refused to comply; but I have no additional information (it is not specified in the indictment).

No jokes here, these are extremely serious criminal charges. All told, Roiland faces a maximum of seven years, four on the DV charge and three on the false imprisonment charge (assuming consecutive sentencing). If convicted on either or both charges, I would expect him to get at least two years, probably four at maximum, but I do not know anything about what is specifically alleged and that will likely change the ultimate sentence. In many liberal jurisdictions, they won't drop DV-related charges even if the victim refuses to cooperate with the prosecution. Given charges of this seriousness bought in such an environment against a public figure, I would expect them to have substantial (and likely dramatic) evidence of the crime to justify bringing the felony charge. Particularly given that Roiland will likely employ the best counsel money can buy and this whole trial will be under a media microscope.

While Roiland's pleading not guilty (as is his right), failing some massive and entirely unexpected revelation of prosecutorial misconduct by the Orange County DA, my money's on the prosecution.

EDIT: Fixed a few typos and a missing citation."
Rick and Morty,"""Roiland’s exit is not expected to impact the hit series, which will continue.""

Uh how is that gonna work?"
Rick and Morty,Maybe Smiling Friends will reign supreme as the new Adult Swim cartoon
Rick and Morty,"They will find someone who can do a really good Rick and morty impression. Make a meta joke about sounding different. And then itll be business as usual.

I’m glad everyone who works on this show isn’t losing their jobs for Justin’s shitty choices.

I am sure all his other shows will follow suit. I doubt solar opposites will survive the cut"
Rick and Morty,"It's simple. They hire this guy.

https://youtu.be/STsET4CAiys"
Rick and Morty,"Why can't people just not be abusers and sex pests that fuck up entire franchises?

Edit: allegedly he's both."
Rick and Morty,They should just get Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox (if able) to replace him
Rick and Morty,"[Here's an article from a couple years back where Roiland admit that he ""pulled back"" from the show during season 4 production.](https://collider.com/justin-roiland-rick-and-morty-season-5-interview-solar-opposites/) Also look up any writer's room pics and you'll notice Harmon is part of it every time, Roiland is never seen.

Bro has been a glorified voice actor and nothing more for YEARS now. This show will be just fine so long as they can find suitable replacements for the voices (which shouldn't be too difficult).

Now Solar Opposites, he's been a lot more actively involved in the creative process there, so that show is probably fucked."
Rick and Morty,"Good all around... except for the circumstances in general.

I love Rick and Morty...

I am... less attached to Justin Roiland...

the show must go on."
Rick and Morty,"Adult Swim: OK, so can you do both Rick and Morty's voices?   
Dude: \*does perfect voices in both characters\*  
AS: Do you drink?   
Dude: no  
AS: Do you send explicit DMs to minors?   
Dude: What?   
AS: DO YOU SEND WEIRD DMS TO MINORS!?  
Dude: NO!   
AS: K. You're hired."
Rick and Morty,So how does Ezra Miller still have a job?
Rick and Morty,"They should get Sean Kelly to voice Rick and Morty. Morty especially, his impression is virtually indistinguishable. 
https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRpwCyUK/"
Rick and Morty,Wonder if they go the family guy route and get a sound alike or the AI route. They got 6 seasons of voices to go through so it would be interesting.
Rick and Morty,Oooooh weeeee..
Rick and Morty,Fuck him. After seeing the things he wrote to some kids... what a piece of shit.
Rick and Morty,"Finish Venture Bros, Metalopcalypse and bring back Tim and Eric."
Rick and Morty,Jump the shark and send them through some sort of voice changing field.
Rick and Morty,Have Dan Harmon voice Rick.
Rick and Morty,Isn’t there some dude on tik tok who does those voices perfectly? I remember Justin even commenting on how good he was. Just hire that impersonator to replace him.
Rick and Morty,"When they say ""became public"" they mean gained traction, because I swear I read about his restraining order stuff back when it happened in 2020."
Rick and Morty,Man had his highest high (High on Life) and lowest low in a matter of WEEKS. Shows what being a POS does to you.
Rick and Morty,"""uh Rick why did we chew broken glass""

""For the continuity morty"""
Rick and Morty,Wow. I can't say I'm surprised but I am shocked they don't think it will impact the show...
Rick and Morty,"""Networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat!""
- Homer Simpson"
Rick and Morty,They only did because it became public. AS doesn’t give a flying fuck that he did it or not. They care about the backlash from it becoming public.
Rick and Morty,one million vendors of marijuana accessories cry out everywhere. you can feel their pain.
Rick and Morty,"I hope no one blames Adult Swim for this (even though this is what will happen). Justin Roland is at fault for this, no one else."
Rick and Morty,"They should do a guest voice actor episode where their voices keep changing to different popular voice actors.

Then at the end it's just sound-alikes."
Rick and Morty,Mark Hamil as Rick?
Rick and Morty,#NOTE: RICK AND MORTY DIED ON THE WAY BACK TO THEIR HOME PLANET
Rick and Morty,BRING BACK VENTURE BROS YOU FUCKING COWARDS
Rick and Morty,"""After charges became public"" So its just about saving face since the original charges happen a while back and you guys didn't drop him then, only when you guys would be publicly dragged for not doing so.  It is always nice to see a company show its true colors in these situations."
Rick and Morty,"Rick and Morty this Rick and morty that but what’s the fate of Hulu’s hit show Solar Opposites? 

/s"
Rick and Morty,"""...after domestic violence charges against him became public"". 

They knew. They always know. They just don't want you to know."
Rick and Morty,Rip Rick and morty
Rick and Morty,">Roiland’s exit is not expected to impact the hit series, which will continue.

It's not just his voice. He's also a co-creator from day 1. His absence will definitely impact the show."
Rick and Morty,"OH SHIT

I think his official title/role changed even in the credits since around when this happened... I was wondering why that was but it would make sense if he was expecting to get canned for the case any time :/"
Rick and Morty,"Unfortunately Dan Harmon is no peach either, I guess he's less expendable."
Rick and Morty,Somewhere Alan Tudyk’s red phone just lit up
Rick and Morty,Adult Swim giving harsher punishments than the NFL + NBA combined!
Rick and Morty,Sometimes it's ok to just let shows die. Not every cartoon needs to exist for 10 seasons.
Rick and Morty,Danny Devito as Rick and Charlie Day as Morty.
Rick and Morty,"This is such a shitty situation. Like fuck him if it's all proven true. But I really believe replacing the voices for Rick and Morty isn't going to fix the issue or be a ""slight change"" that we can adapt to and accept. 

The reason is that Justin Roiland used a lot of improv and had a certain energy that essentially created the personality of Rick and Morty the characters, as well as the show entirely. Creating dumb aliens in a drunken craze while the microphone was still recording. I mean that's how Mr. Poopy butthole was created. 

I firmly believe the show will suffer and just not be the same. Every aspect of this sucks."
Rick and Morty,Did they not know about this in 2020 or are they just doing this now because everyone else found out?
Rick and Morty,I'm sure they've done an internal investigation and are cutting ties before the shit really hits the fan.
Rick and Morty,They knew huh
Rick and Morty,Take the opportunity to have Morty's voice suddenly break and be voiced by James Earl Jones
Rick and Morty,"Remember, he didnt just voice Rick and Morty but also voiced a lot of minor characters. Just google ”Justin Roiland minor” for a list."
Rick and Morty,They can wait to the result of the trial?
Rick and Morty,"So he has been charged, but not found guilty?"
Rick and Morty,Hey adult swim how bout shifting that Rick and morty money over to venture bros and let’s all come together and have a rusty venture
Rick and Morty,"Cancel rick and morty and finish the Venture Bros story, you cowards"
Rick and Morty,"Exactly how has none of the well documented online grooming thing exploded in the news? It was a news story on The Mary Sue and discussed here and there on Reddit, but to me that’s like some insane shit that I would expect to be absolutely blown up. 

There literally are tons of screenshots of him being wildly inappropriate with underage girls, and there hasn’t been a peep about it in mainstream news."
Rick and Morty,"Well folks, Season 1 & 2 were peak comedy TV for me, and the rest of the episodes varied in quality but there were definitely some good ones! Sucks Justin Roiland did bad things and got a fun show cancelled, sucks for the victim he hurt, sucks for the folks who work on the show and sucks for the fans. Sure it's a goofy show and I know idolising celebrities is never a great idea, but I was a genuine fan of his and I looked up to what he was able to achieve. I hope Alex Hirsch, someone else that has always inspired me, is not such a treacherous and abusive person. ""People will get more from the idea he represented than the jellybean he really was"""
Rick and Morty,Wtf has the world come to when Adult Swim has more integrity to get rid of Roiland than WBD has letting a guy who slapped the shit out of wife ON VIDEO keep his show ABOUT SLAPPING PEOPLE!!!!
Rick and Morty,He has like 3 voices
Rick and Morty,Make a thing to try a new voice every episode as a running joke lol
Rick and Morty,"The article says the defense attorney thinks the case might be dismissed. Whether or not that’s true, what happens if this case is tossed out or he’s found not guilty? Is he just donezo no matter what?"
Rick and Morty,"Oh jeeze, Rick!"
Rick and Morty,"The public was never meant to know about Justin Roland, people will get more from the idea he represented than the jellybean he really was."
Rick and Morty,"This is kind of exciting to me because I think Harmon is a much stronger creative, at least for my tastes. I don’t doubt they can find a new voice actor for any animated character so I’m not too concerned with that side, though I figure it could take them a season to really get into the roles well"
Rick and Morty,Cancel rick and morty put the money and team to work with the team for venture bros and bring that back.
Rick and Morty,"I'm a big fan of the show. A couple points:  

Upcoming season 7 is almost done anyway, including the voice work. However, how it will work beyond that is unknown. If they can find someone who can reliably voice both Rick & Morty, they might be able to continue. IIRC they are contracted through ten seasons but I may be misremembering.    

Also, unfortunately, the DV charges Roiland is facing may be the least of his problems. There are allegations that he had groomed underage teens. Not sure what's going to become of that, but it's not a good look.  

That being said, it's for the best that they severed ties at this point."
Rick and Morty,Guess it’ll be Rick and two jackdaws
Rick and Morty,I’m so glad the entire article talks about his achievements and not at all about the abuse or who it happened to or when or really any facts about the case. The entire article just licks his balls continuously.
Rick and Morty,"Now we will have wrong sounding R&M

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3-xFCJPul7M"
Rick and Morty,Roy & Morkey coming soon
Rick and Morty,"He can record in his basement, who is gonna know? lol"
Rick and Morty,Some casting director somewhere is about to hear a bunch of bad Rick and Morty impressions
Rick and Morty,Alex Hirsch as a replacement?
Rick and Morty,"Well, this sucks. Obviously supporting a domestic abuser isn't good, but I am also probably not going to continue watching the show without Roiland.

Why did he have to turn out to be a dick too? Why couldn't he just be nice so he didn't have to get fired."
Rick and Morty,"Harmon is the show anyway, community was fucking brilliant and deserves a movie. #6seasonsandamovie"
Rick and Morty,">!Roiland has been charged with one felony count of domestic battery with corporal injury and one felony count of false imprisonment by menace, violence, fraud and/or deceit by the Orange County District Attorney’s office.!<

So he threw something at his lady friend, hitting her and causing injuries, and then prevented her from leaving the scene.  Yeah, that's not a good look."
Rick and Morty,So charges not a conviction??
Rick and Morty,"It was such a great show, disappointing that it will have to discontinue."
Rick and Morty,"What the actual fuck. Whenever I start watching a show I like, some shit like this happens like a week after I finish binging.

Inside Job? Cancelled.

Voltron? Literally imploded on the last season

Rick and Morty? Main guy gets fired for domestic assault charges.

I’m starting to think I should stop watching good shows for the benefit of humanity."
Rick and Morty,This was way back in 2020 and this shit is still not resolved...?
Rick and Morty,"Hire Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd to do the voices, you cowards."
Rick and Morty,Six Seasons and a Felony
Rick and Morty,Roiland's voice roles to be re-cast. I don't think that's going to work for anyone.
Rick and Morty,Awww jeez Justin
Rick and Morty,"I don't think replacing Rick and Morty's voices will be an issue - I mean look at Cleveland in Family Guy. The new guy sounds *just like* Mike Henry. And they've got a large enough pool of regular contributors like Brandon Johnson, Tom Kenny, Nolan North etc. that it'll be nice for the side characters to not be so reliant on Roiland.  


The issue is that Roiland did more than voice acting - he was the co-creator of the show. If this were any other network and they didn't have that four additional season agreement I think Harmon would've just called it there."
Rick and Morty,"Wow I'm honestly surprised they made this call. Good for WBD. They're literally recasting the main characters and the creator. If you follow Roiland's other work (all of which I do and love) you'd know that he has a very specific style. So hopefully they can replicate it.

Anyway I'm bummed as a Roiland fan. But he allegedly fucked up and he deserves whatever consequences come his way. 

Now with that said hey WBD you still have Ezra Miller on your payroll. You might want to look into that too."
Rick and Morty,"All they have to do is just switch to a new universe where everyone has different voices. Boom, problem solved."
Rick and Morty,People more upset over losing him vs his arrest for domestic violence
Rick and Morty,So the guy hasn’t even had a trial yet but his life is starting to unravel?
Rick and Morty,"I love Rick and Morty, but it's probably best to just let it die with some dignity instead of Two-and-a-Half Manning it."
Rick and Morty,"Imaging having a job where the mere allegation of wrongdoing in your personal life could ruin your career.

Sucks to be famous, I guess?"
Rick and Morty,"The show is dead now. No matter how much you try to say the show won’t be impacted, of course it’s gonna be. The dude has creative influence, whether you like it or not. His absence will be felt. Not to mention he voices the main characters, and fans are not gonna be happy if they sound different. Much like The Office, after Steve Carrell left, subsequent seasons will not be viewed as favorably, regardless of their quality."
Rick and Morty,"Damn. I certainly understand the reasoning here, but the show is never going to be the same. Not even because of the voices, but because of his contribution to the writing. 

Oddly enough, a few months ago, Roiland had a whole segment on I think Variety.com where he was kind of auditioning a bunch of different would-be imitators who did their own versions of Morty and Rick. Some of them were really damn close, and even Justin said it was spooky. I wouldn’t be surprised if one of those guys ends up being cast as the new Rick and Morty. 

I just wonder what will happen in regards to the storytelling and comedy. Harmon and Roiland had a very particular weird synthesis going there. I’m also wondering if the next domino to fall will be Hulu kicking him to the curb from Solar Opposites."
Rick and Morty,Ok but how is this going to affect Koala Man. Because that's what I need to know.
Rick and Morty,"People underestimate how a lot of iconic takes in Rick & Morty were actually spontaneous impromptu brilliance of Justin Roiland’s giving life to Rick & Morty (One can recognize how good of a job he did with it while acknowledging he was a piece of s**t in real life).

The show will absolutely take a hit in quality."
Rick and Morty,"When the fuck are we going to start valuing habeas corpus again? The Nerdist immediately erases any mention of Chris Hardwick, a network he created. Disney fires Johnny Depp from the POTC franchise, his character reoccurring in every film. When the fuck are we going to learn? If it turns out he did it, then fine, fire him and take his show from him, but our entire justice system's philosophy revolves around the idea that an accusation should not be taken as condemnable, you short-sighted, cowardly fucks."
Rick and Morty,"Long shot here…but if the guy is found not guilty, would Adult Swim have him back? Or is just too much drama for them to care?

Besides, even if he’s out he’s probably going to continue to collect royalties?"
Lost and Found Music Studios,Didn't Bob Iger just a few days ago say that he'd be leaning harder on core Disney franchises like Marvel to push Disney+?
Lost and Found Music Studios,Quality > quantity.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"The amount of content coming out on Disney+ is pretty slow already, only reason I stay subscribed is because I get it for cheap.

edit: some grammar"
Lost and Found Music Studios,[deleted]
Lost and Found Music Studios,The fact Agatha has a show is hilarious lol
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Or...you know...hire better writers, figure out your story-endings before postproduction & 
stop treating VFX studios like expendable slaves. That'll do the trick."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Oh they need more time in between all these six-episode-can-barely-be-called-a-series tv shows? Damn.
Lost and Found Music Studios,Seems to coincide with a pending WGA strike.
Lost and Found Music Studios,can they try making shows that are actually good too?
Lost and Found Music Studios,"If theyre going to keep with the 6 episodes at maybe 30min formula then ill care even less than before. Their shows are so laser focused and short its over by the time there is anything barely caring about. Id love to see more Jessica Jones or Daredevil, but im worried they just be as pathetically short"
Lost and Found Music Studios,I mean it’s already been a solid 3 months since She-Hulk ended and we still have no word on a release date for Secret Invasion. I thought it was obvious they’re spacing things out.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"They're too slow already IMO. There was a burst of them near launch, and they dried up to nothing months later."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Makes sense, I think the pandemic pushed them into overdrive a bit.

Probably 2 shows a year would be the right spot"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"> But I do think there is something fun about leaning back and watching an episode that can be relatively self-contained.

> Lost was an incredibly influential show because it was this serialized story, which was not seen in television much. Now it's been how long, 20 years? Since then, almost everything has become like that. So now — and I think you're seeing this not just with our shows, but with many other shows — you're starting to see the fun of a self-contained, episodic story week to week. We're going to experiment with that in some of our upcoming things.

I'd definitely love a Monster of the Week type show!"
Lost and Found Music Studios,It doesn't matter if they're 2-3 years apart if they're still garbage content.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Just give me more shows like Andor and fewer shows like everything else on D+

More intelligent, quality writing. For the love of god, please give me better dialogue in these shows."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Not terribly surprising. I think the audience probably has the appetite for all this content, so I suspect it's more about budget. 

Between Bob Chapek's financial chicanery, frontloading for D+, VFX pipelines, competition, and the economy, a course correction was inevitable."
Lost and Found Music Studios,they shouldve to begin with tbh
Lost and Found Music Studios,"We don’t need more slow down, we need better quality"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Pretty sure the damage is done already.   Initial pace of content released for Marvel was incredibly high for Disney plus.   

Way too much.   Normal people don't have that kind of time"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Another interesting takeaway is that Feige seems to be distancing Marvel from their “movie told in 6 parts” television strategy too. Seems there’s more of an interest in episodic story telling (similar to the Mandalorian or Star Trek).

Great news too. Very tired of a singular story awkwardly chopped into parts, like Falcon and the Winter Soldier or Moon Knight."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Im moving on from MCU! It’s run its course.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Uhhhh… there hasn’t been a new show on Disney+ for 6 months… unless something new besides She-Hulk: Attorney at Law came out.  What are they going to drop down to two shows/seasons a year?

In four years Marvel TV / ABC / Netflix figured out how to do three seasons of Daredevil, three seasons of Jessica Jones, two seasons of The Punisher, two seasons of Luke Cage, two seasons of Iron Fist…AND eight episodes of the Defenders.  

That’s 161 episodes in 4 years.  Not only that, each episode was an hour long! 

Each of the seasons of Moon Night, Falcon & Winter Soldier, Ms Marvel, She-Hulk, Loki, and What If? (Animated) has been less than 10 episodes and as low as 6.  All told in two years they have produced 57 episodes of content.  I haven’t ran the total runtime numbers.  But the episodes from Disney+ are noticeably shorter for most series."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Glad to hear it, now I only need to get D+ for 2 months tops a year to see a years worth of content! I agree, quality>quantity, but the thing is, if they want me to pay for it 12 months a year, I want both. Most of the D+ shows are 6-8 episodes, or 6-8 hours of viewing. I can EASILY watch the  6-8 D+ shows along with 4-6 movies a year I'm interested in in 2 months while still fitting in re-watching an old show or two, and then switch to HBOMax to for 2 months to see their entire years worth of content, then Para+ for 2 months, then Netflix for 2 months,  then PeaCock for 2 months, and then I'm set and still save money!

These companies all want their own streaming services so maximize profit. Well, I want to maximize my value, and none of these services put out enough content a year to rationalize paying for an entire year. That is how us as customers break these crappy practices. Companies care about profit over customers and are seemingly forgetting neither are guaranteed."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Anyone get marvel fatigue ?
Lost and Found Music Studios,But what else am I gonna watch?
Lost and Found Music Studios,So less reason to keep Disney+? So confusing.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I’m happy with the MCU, it’s lightning in a bottle and something that won’t be replicated with the same quality for decades after it wraps up.

My only gripe is that it feels like we were introduced to Kang too early. Majors has the weight of being the big bad until 2026."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Sometimes I forget I’ve watched some of them. Specific moments stand out in my memory (like Kingpin’s introduction, or Falcon fully becoming Captain America) but I find myself saying “oh yeah i did see (show)” only She-Hulk really completely sticks with me the most for how wild and out there it was (and Daredevil’s return to the small screen)"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Maybe I'm in the minority but I was thoroughly enjoying the shows, and the amount of shows coming. The spaces in between are some of the worst, I can't imagine less and spacing them out more. Disney+'s release pipeline is already way to thin..."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"No thanks, keep them coming, I want more!"
Lost and Found Music Studios,Time to quit Disney +
Lost and Found Music Studios,It's not superhero fatigue. Feige. It's the quality of the stuff you're putting out.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Shows outside Marvel franchise are not very successful. They need new, fresh content that can have many seasons. Not limited series that you can watch in one sitting. Quantity is important too. I mostly watch older series on D+, because the few premiere shows that are now streaming are not that good."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"make the shows better please. a couple have been excellent, and some have been atrocious."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Thank god. Idk how many more marvel shows and movies I can put up with at this point. I love my boyfriend but dear god the superhero thing is getting *old*
Lost and Found Music Studios,Let's see if this improves the the VFX and labor practices in that industry
Lost and Found Music Studios,Marvel Disney+ shows ruined the franchise
Lost and Found Music Studios,Can you make them good too?
Lost and Found Music Studios,Preferably less TV shows and more specials imo
Lost and Found Music Studios,I’m so sick of super hero shit
Lost and Found Music Studios,And reduce the cost to reflect the lower amount of product received? Just kidding of course not.
Lost and Found Music Studios,Boo
Lost and Found Music Studios,Because they aren't afraid of DCU catching up.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Last year had 3 MCU shows, 2023 right now has 6 shows confirmed...so they should probably update that."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Ok well if there's not something on it new for at least 1 week every month, I'll just start canceling it when I don't need it."
Lost and Found Music Studios,why? there is nothing to watch on disney plus.  shouldn't they keep pumping out new show?
Lost and Found Music Studios,Unsubscribe and then just do a month of subscription every 4 months or so.
Lost and Found Music Studios,More Hawkeye pls   After Jeremy heals up
Lost and Found Music Studios,Please! And quit announcing upcoming films/shows and make us anticipate what’s next during the credits’ scene like in Phase 1. There’s no more magic.
Lost and Found Music Studios,Good. Guys went fucking crazy this past cycle
Lost and Found Music Studios,I just want toon Disney shows man.
Lost and Found Music Studios,To keep people subscribed.
Lost and Found Music Studios,No.
Lost and Found Music Studios,Sure way to kill it!! It’s too slow already!
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Just keep pumping them out. Have yet to sit down and watch anything past the Avengers, but am stoked to one day do so.

Maybe I’ll save it all for retirement 🤷‍♂️"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Honestly, all streaming services (and movie studios for that matter) need to do this. I don't have the chance to get hyped for a show before it's already came and went and so did 3 others. And 4 more are set to release in a few months (hyperbole, but you catch my drift).

Gone are the summers where a few blockbusters come out that everyone wants to see. All studios want a piece of your attention and will bombard you with content until you submit or give up."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Is that A Train?
Lost and Found Music Studios,Who's buying puts on Disney?
Lost and Found Music Studios,X for doubt.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Marvel is now adopting a ""less is more"" approach. Which is reasonable, since they were oversaturating the market. But this is also the way Star Wars went. It is a sign that things are not going to so well."
Lost and Found Music Studios,More stuff like mandalorian and less like she-hulk please.
Lost and Found Music Studios,I thought that was A-train in the corner
Lost and Found Music Studios,i was looking at this for 5 minutes wondering why there is a picture of A-Train
Lost and Found Music Studios,We went through three stages of the marvel cinematic universe and I didn't even notice.
Lost and Found Music Studios,I’d be happy with a trickle and then nothing altogether.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Slow it down to a stop and figure some shit out cause damn Marvel has been bad lately. 

They're currently trying to make Fantastic Four which is incredibly challenging and almost always turns out shitty."
Lost and Found Music Studios,I had super hero fatigue a decade ago. It's too much.
Lost and Found Music Studios,I can’t extendedly wait for more terrible product to show up…
Lost and Found Music Studios,So glad to hear this! We’ve been missing the anticipation of the next thing.
Lost and Found Music Studios,So vomiting out as much low quality content as physically possible wasn’t a good decision? I’m shocked!
Lost and Found Music Studios,Has he thought about making good shows?
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I’m so burnt out of Marvel, I’d rather see some new Star Wars content like Andor."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Took em long enough to realise less is more and quality should always come before quantity
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Phase 4 was a wet fart in a plastic bag.

The MCU is practically dead. Star Wars is so dead its already been eaten by the worms. Disney need to stop ruining treasured franchises.

Indiana Jones is next"
Lost and Found Music Studios,Good. I can't keep up with all of the shows and movies. Starting to rank and watch according to importance.
Lost and Found Music Studios,Saw that coming from a mile away. Wouldn't surprise me if we don't see Avengers 5 and 6 until after 2027
Lost and Found Music Studios,Maybe hire some new writers and stop shoehorning in the ideology of the day. Stick to telling stories ffs.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Best Marvel shows were on Netflix. Since it moved to Disney it's been middle of the road crap.

What I liked about Jessica Jones in particular was that it was part of that universe, but felt far more grown up. That is the value of having distinct formats contributing to a unified universe.

Now everything is too choreographed. There's no point of difference. And Disney has shat out loads and loads of content that ultimately feels very similar. It feels pointless and bland."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"\- Stop hiring Rick & Morty writers. I don't know why Feige seems obsessed with them but they need to go.  
\- Most of the Disney+ shows have been middling at best. Slowing down on them is one thing but actually making them good is another.  
\-CG. I get it. It's important in building these fantastic worlds and often time easier than practical locations but *everything* being done on a green screen is dull.  
\-Embrace street level heros more. (Daredevil yay!) Not every character needs to be in the avengers (or should want to be)"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Slowing things down means we can start viewing these shows/series as the bigger events they are that can be shared with the family. It’ll be easier to stay caught up as well, because the idea that you may not understand something in the big theatrical releases because you didn’t watch a show, but there’s so many shows now, kind of sucks.

I feel bad for anybody trying to jump in at this point."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"All of this has just become so exhausting to keep up with. This overlap between television and movies sounds good in theory, but I... just can't get myself to care. It was one thing when Falcon and Winter Soldier essentially ended where it started (Falcon is Captain America, so watching any movie where Sam Wilson is featured won't have much of a difference between having seen the show and not) but I would've been utterly confused watching Doctor Strange 2 if I hadn't seen Wandavision. 

I think I've mostly been lucky in that the only other show* that I bothered to watch was Loki so the multiverse element is richer than if I hadn't seen it (though I guess No Way Home can still act as a good primer for this), but I just look at the rest of these shows and say... eh...

We're already at a point where the movies are simultaneously not putting together coherent trilogies but also not acting as linear progressions of a larger Phase story, and it's just kind of becoming too ridiculous to focus on.

*okay, I also watched She Hulk, but that mostly seemed like it was going to be entirely detached from Marvel at-large."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I have been oversaturated by Marvel since Endgame, basically. It seems like there are several properties i havent seen yet. sometimes i hear about one that's out that i havent even heard of.

It's too much! We have lives, you know! (Not really, but still)"
Lost and Found Music Studios,Its called the M-She-U now
Lost and Found Music Studios,"A good move. Rushing productions and creative teams has clearly taken a toll on the studio's results. 

While they still have a some great IP's and good shows, many of the last few years shows and movies have felt rushed and slapped together at times."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I just wish they could maintain something interesting to watch 52 weeks of the year, once a week."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I always felt the super hero fatigue talking point was introduced as propaganda to permit them to slow everything down and increase their margins. A casual viewer could have just paced themselves to avoid it. Now instead of having one hour of tv a week to look forward to, Disney can be like the “people have spoken and we must air law and order reruns to appease the masses and we have to increase the sub fee to keep pace with inflation”."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Finally. It was a bad idea, thematically speaking, to ramp up the amount of content after endgame. I understand why they did it from a business standpoint, but for me it has greatly diminished my interest in the MCU"
Lost and Found Music Studios,That’s actually a good thing. They are pushing it way too much and quality went downhill.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Honestly these things needed to happen anyway because talk of ""superhero fatigue"" is only growing stronger, not to mention the fact Marvel was already starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel as far as A and B tier heroes. I'm assuming with the coming of Secret Wars they're going to wipe the slate clean so they take a pause for a beat, then bring back some of the early MCU characters in new series with new actors."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Good, not every breakout character needs a spin-off."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I don’t get Disney plus. It has such little content, dialing back content doesn’t seem to be a good long term move"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Maybe slow down on movies?? The last marvel movie i saw in theaters was Love and Thunder and the last one I enjoyed was no way home. With Quantumania coming up that’s at least two movies since them and I’ve just completely lost interest. As others have said, try focusing on quality, not quantity."
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I’ll probably be alone with that opinion, but imo the quality has been steadily decreasing since 2014-2016. Ragnarok’s success made them include the same slapstick humor in everything, and that took a lot of joy from the MCU. I liked the contrasts. Steve sincere way versus Tony’s jokes, versus Thor’s pathos. Nowadays, everyone has Tony’s humor, and there is no sincerity or pathos to be found. A soup doesn’t taste without salt, but neither does to taste when there is nothing but salt."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Hopefully they focus on what made phase 1-3 gold (other than a few missteps here and there )… Rather than the post endgame trash that phase 4 has been
Lost and Found Music Studios,That isnt going to help if they are still steaming piles of dogshit when they hit the air is it?
Lost and Found Music Studios,"From a practical point of view, it's possible they were only able to make six hours of content (including credits) but literally none of those shows should have been six hours of contents (including credits), and the fact they all are is the actual problem with most of them.^1 

The thing is... I don't buy that argument. The plan was always six hours of content.

None of the problems with these shows can be fixed by spacing them out more. Badly structured plots are badly structured plots whether there's a month of seven years between them.


^1 What If being the exception."
Lost and Found Music Studios,Oh cool.  Another platform making me wait 1-2 weeks between episodes. No thanks I'll wait until it's released and illegally download it instead.
Lost and Found Music Studios,"Now if only he could slow down the wokeness that he pushes at expense of the characters that should be used, he could prioritize the plots instead of the nonsense we get just to feature Ms Marvel or Mahershala Ali in a pointless movie they didn't even have planned. (gasp, I made hatespeech on this godforsaken sub)"
Lost and Found Music Studios,"I don’t care about the quantity if they can have quality but it’s not there. 

Marvel had arguably 1 great series with Loki.

Star Wars had 1 great show with Andor and mando being close to great. 

The rest ranged from good to bad with most leaning towards bad. 

They need a new leader for the Star Wars universe and maybe feige needs to pass the torch to someone more passionate."

The case has stalled for some unknown reason, most likely because Scn is throwing threats around.

The Ranch,"Why is it that allegations are the standard for automatically convicting people of anything that is considered sexual assault/rape. I am not trying to defend the offender and if someone is found guilty in a court of law then they should go to prison. But we are now starting to move from “blame the victim” to “all the victim needs to do is say it and the abuser is automatically guilty”. False accusations exist, people who want their 15 minutes of fame exist, we cannot start convicting people of these extreme crimes off of the allegations of a few people. They need to be brought in court and go through due process before I start calling everybody rapists. Has there even be any proof by any of these claims? Have any of these allegations against any of the alleged offenders actually been proven by evidence in court? I haven’t seen one person charged with a crime and actually convicted. Once again I’m not trying to defend rapists, if someone is found guilty after going through a fair trial or the evidence is overwhelmingly against them then by all means fuck them, but I’m not gonna sit here and automatically consider someone guilty just because of hearsay."

Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"The producer I am associated with now actively tries to create positive, fully-realized minority characters, both men and women, in his projects. I wish we could have more Daniel Dae Kims, Ken Watanabes and BD Wongs, but unfortunately the fully-realized characters they play are a rare thing. -- 

But I recently worked on a TV show where the showrunner was anti-diversity. He would push more airtime for white characters and reduce the screen presence/validity of minority characters. He also truly believed that diversity writer programs existed only because diverse writers were inferior to ""real"" (read:white male) writers and that diversity writers only 'mucked things up' for ""real"" writers.  I'm  Asian, and instead of treating me like part of the creative team, he did everything to discount and ignore my contributions, but I digress... 

Good for you for speaking up. Just know that there are others out there trying to work positively against this bias.  We need more diverse voices behind the scenes, especially when they are not welcome. I don't want to think all of Hollywood are consciously trying to create racist characters. Overall, I think it's just lazy writing. Perhaps the few executives who are guilty of creating weak/submissive/fetishized/stereotypical roles for Asians are just sheltered and lack any worldly experience, exposure and interaction with (or are fearful to accept?) real people like us.

The reason being was because the incredulity of a white baby being the first and only child to be lost and adored by the wild even though Africans lived in Africa for thousands of years only a white male child could control and speak to the animals.   Media and society has such a limited perception of what every one truly is.  We need to expose all cultures unilaterally.

Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"That's horribly frustrating to hear. Indians have similar problems to Asians, but I don't think the situation is quite as bad.

I think what it will take to change this are more Asian creators of content. White guys don't see a problem with their privilege. You need to get more Asians in the background with the power to make casting calls before you actually get them in the front. Tina Fey actually has a great description for how she got over the bias against female comedians in her book called Going Over and Going Around. I would recommend checking it out cause the gender battle for representation in media is comparable with how Asians are portrayed today. 

Other than rising directly through the executive ranks, I think creators who produce content through other channels can circumvent the system. If their work gets popular it's hard to ask them to suddenly remove an asian character. You can make a successful Youtube web series that gains a big following then get it converted into a full time show. Novelists can feature Asian protagonists in their work who will get carried on into the big screen if the book becomes popular enough to be turned into a movie.

It is unfortunately going to take time, and I hope you have the persistence to make it higher in the industry. Things are getting better on average, your shithead EP aside. People aren't just relying on American media anymore, which is why this Kpop show even exists. As China, India and Korea become richer and start producing shows Western audiences will actually want to watch, perceptions will change regardless of Hollywood. From what I hear, this generation of Asian teen-early 20s males has it quite easier than even late 20s-early 30s guys."

Eventually asian men need to move past the anger phase use an appropriate agressive response (im not talking about violence, just agressive enterprising) like what 50 cent talks about and put out our own shit. Circumvent the bad part of hollywood, because we dont need them.

In fact, there are holes in hollywood's game. They're showing weakness by being conservative and mostly only making established franchises. So put together top notch scripts / movies that give asians the same opportunities.

Look at rocketjump.

Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"Not that it makes what you said any less true, but one of the biggest reasons Asian men are so neutered in American pop culture is because America's first sex symbol was Japanese.

Look up Sessue Hayakawa. He was a silent-era movie star who was absolutely adored by women. Basically, the reason there are no Asian men in pop culture is because white men felt threatened by your sex appeal."

Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"Cultural attitudes shifts takes time, and I mean a lot of time to change. 

2 decades plus ago, I am not even sure if there are any prominent Asians roles at all on TV unless you count George Takei in Star Trek and even then Star Trek:TOS took place way back more than 4 decades.  

At least now, you have several Asians in fairly prominent roles (E.g Heroes, The Walking Dead, Lost) and this list only counts the Asian males. For Asian females, there is a much longer list of shows. 

The films where they insistently put a white guy in a clearly Asian role (eg. Dragonball Evolution, 47 Ronins) the film flopped massively. Now it doesn't mean that the film would have done well if it were an Asian playing the role, but it shows that putting a white guy isn't really gonna help your film. 

For the ""Blacks"", it clearly also took a long while, ie. decades before things gradually change for them on tv too. It was only in the last few years that I noticed that more tv series (Eg. Fringe, Blacklist, Homeland) had blacks as the head of CIA/FBI/Special Ops and of course you start seeing Marvel films putting blacks replacing white comic characters. 

So be patient. And more importantly, don't look to TV to begin with to have strong role models and never ever blame what's happening on TV as an excuse for what's going on in your lives. 

And c'mon, to blame tv for making Asians look bad (I'm an Asian btw), that is just weak. "

I thought that Tom Cruise's character was an alcoholic and the samurai helped him gain a new perspective on life. Didn't he also commit suicide with them? (5 month old edit: Was wrong, he didn't commit suicide with him)

> Pacific Rim (only a white guy can save the world and protect those poor helpless Asians and save that Asian girl from distress, Asian guys are useless and they die)

Having seen Pacific Rim, I think you're kinda underestimating Mako's effort in the movie (not that Pacific Rim is a masterpiece, oh hell no). Also, be glad they weren't forced into a romance.

> Iron Man (The Mandarin is a wimp instead of a bad ass villain)

He was supposed to be asian for the film? (I know he is in the comics)I thought they just white-washed him and made him Ben Kingsley and made no reference to him being asian. (Haven't seen Iron Man 3, but read the twist and know what happens)

One thing I find interesting is that the opposite stereotype sort of applies to black people. Guys are sexualized while women are marginalized. 

When it comes to kids, they've got the Avatar shows, where everyone is Asian. 

Also, I think one thing that's different about Asians compared to other minorities like blacks is that Asian countries produce a lot of really cool entertainment themselves, which doesn't help you fit in here in the US, but at least it gives you people who look like you. "
Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"I agree with you. Another issue we have is what I'd like to call the low hanging fruit issue. One positive of being Asian is that we have a strong culture back home (wherever that may be). If you have any mild success in the US, you can easily leapfrog that back where you are ethnically and rather than be an obscure figure, you can have a shot at being huge mainstream. Think of Jackie Chan. Yes, occasional US success, but why settle for minor success in the US, when you're a major force in China and HK? Another example is Charice Pempengco. She debuted in Glee as a small character. Went back to the Philippines and BOOM. Instant bigger role. 

Yes, I would like more major roles for Asian guys in the US, but I feel like it makes sense why they just go back and become a huge deal back where they are ethnically. "

As with Avatar, Dev Patel plays Zuko who eventually becomes a good guy so he's not necessarily the villain. He got shit from the internet because he was brown type of Asian despite Avatar being heavily influenced from Hinduism. 

Also what about West Asians (Middle East) and South Asians (Subcontinent of India) actors? Your list only includes East Asians. I'm not trying to attack you OP but you kinda neglected us in your list,  I could say that's kinda racist since many East Asians don't even refer to us as Asian's which annoys me. 

Things are slowly changing and you have many Asian actors who don't play stereotypical roles to show that we are normal everyday people. It takes time and you can see things are changing. We just need to make more movies and put our selves out there and keep rejecting stereotypes and keep creating complex and three dimensional characters for audiences to fall in love with. "

I hope that he answered the question sarcastically simply not understanding that it would have been an awesome opportunity to speak about diversity in television.

As an Asian male onscreen performer, I quite often deal with the negative stereotypes associated with Asian men - undateable, diminuitive, not sexually appealling, etc. But I and pretty much every other Asian male performer out there whose name is not Ken Jeong am working everyday to break those stereotypes.

Some people have noted Star Trek's Ferengi are essentially exports of Shylock's essence- but filled out in different ways, and they've somewhat distanced themselves from being *specifically* Jewish... which seems to remove them from being racist.

By contrast, Watto in *The Phantom Menace* has a strongly Jewish accent, a huge ""Jewish stereotype"" nose, and stereotype Jewish mannerisms (gestures).  And he has no redeeming qualities other than he's straightforward about his price.  He's a racist Space Shylock.

Hangover, pacific rim, iron man3 are the ones that come to mind that I didn't think were super racist, but there were more. I'll agree w you that Long Duk Dong is basically a hate crime. 

What I don't understand however is why you're pissing and moaning about it on reddit. If you're so upset about the portrayal of your culture by the media do something about it! For most people that's easier said than done, but you work in the industry for fucks sake! 

It pisses me off to see these bs cultural stereotypes on tv as a Hispanic man. Im either a thug, a gardener, or some hot headed degenerate. You have a real opportunity to push for a shift in cultural perception. Pissing about it like a baby on reddit isn't the way to go imo. 

I spent a lot of years in the pacific when I was a kid so I saw the full of spectrum of Asian guys from the stereotypical nerdy perception the western world has to our fantastically handsome and athletic prom king(s) that aren't nearly as well represented in Hollywood. So it bums me out when I see these incredibly one dimensional characters as the only representations of some of my best friends.

Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"This is a bit ridiculous.  You want major shows to be focused around Asians, but [according to this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States), unless I'm misreading it, less than 5% (edit - ten?) of the population of the US are Asian.

This just in:  In America, Asians are actually a minority.  Why would they cater to a minor demographic?  It would be like if I went to China and expected to see the television there dominated by non-Asian peoples.

I think you might benefit from this advice:

https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100423212117AAgkAgG

Also there are talent agent that *specialize* in finding work for Asian actors.  You should have one.

When it comes down to it, you MUST understand that ""work is work"".  There is no such thing as a role which is beneath you.  You'll find a lot of big-name actors have terrible movies in their credits.  Half of Nicholas Cage's work is utterly unwatchable crap.  He starred in the 2014 *Left Behind* movie, a 2% Fresh rating on RottenTomatoes, the role's writing was so terrible I don't know how he could even speak the lines without laughing, let alone waste his talent on it.  

But that's why he succeeds.  He takes anything, and brings his best, even if the role is shit.  So, you.  If you want to succeed, you need a tough skin.  That means if you get an opportunity to play an evil Japanese, then you still gotta jump on it.

And directors, producers, writers need not be racist to get stuck writing ""evil Asian"" Fu Manchu roles.  They have to make product that sells well, the market is fickle and highly competitive.  99.9% of character formulas don't ""work"" with an audience.  Every once in awhile someone discovers a new ""working"" formula.

If asian men truly want to make a difference, I suggest the first step they take is to directly confront shit like this with all their outrage at the injustices they've been dealt the *moment it happens*, not afterwards.  Little things like this left alone a little too long is just another thing you let the white man get away with, yet again.

Die Sendung mit dem Elefanten,"IMO this is essentially a case of sex sells. Asian women are beautiful and a lot of white men find them appealing, so this is why you are seeing what you are seeing. These white men in Asian roles are fulfilling white men's desire to be with an Asian girl. It isn't necessarily racist nor is it right to do, but that's how entertainment works. The goal is to have your target audience vicariously experience their protagonist's story. 

Another possible reason is the 20th century's multiple conflicts with Asian countries. Older Americans are still weary of Asian culture because of WW2, Vietnam, the Korean War and the fact that we are currently frenemies with China and technically enemies with North Korea. Growing up, my grandparents would NEVER have even considered buying an Asian vehicle, it was unthinkable. They would scoff every time they read a label that said made in China.  

I have extensive experience personally of a white family's accepting of Asian culture as my wife is Korean, and not American born. She came over as my fiance when she was 29 and we just finished getting her green card after 8 years of BS. We didn't meet online or anything sketchy, we met in person while she was here on a work visa but my immediate family was still skeptic at first, but they now love her as their own daughter. I wouldn't trade her for the world as she has broadened my horizons culturally and I even got to visit Korea twice and meet her family. 

My advice is to keep your head up and keep doing what you're doing, I believe things will be changing for the better in the future as the world keeps getting ""smaller"" as technology is breaking down distances and communication barriers. "

Randall Park, George Takei and Hiroyuki Sanada are great actors, but most of them are pretty old tho. I'm not sure is there any other actors who are in 18-25 age range who are very talented and are Asian.

Demon King Daimao,"As a Wisconsinite and someone who is a Packer fan, Nandor's impersonation of the Packer fan family was both hilarious and spot on."
Demon King Daimao,"Omg - WWDITS became such a comfort show of mine. Absolutely hilarious. Our Flag Means Death, Toast, and IT Crowd are HUGE favorites in my home and constantly quoted. I was unsure of Our Flag Means Death at first, but glad I stuck around. Loved it!"
Demon King Daimao,This fucking guy
Demon King Daimao,creepy paper!
Demon King Daimao,Facking guy
Demon King Daimao,It needs to be said *adult* Colin Fucking Robinson. I couldn't stomach much little Colin.
Demon King Daimao,The disgusting beast that  crawled from the dessicated corpse of our good friend Colin Robinson?
Demon King Daimao,Jesk!
Demon King Daimao,"Always good to be suspicious of shows based on films/books/games you enjoyed. I went in worried this may ruin the movie for me, but ""creeepy paper"" really sold it for me, and it just kept getting better the more you got to know these characters."
Demon King Daimao,"Strangely enough, I didn't care all that much for the movie but LOVE the show"
Demon King Daimao,If you like Nadja (Natasia Demetriou) I highly recommend her brother’s sitcom Stath Lets Flats.  She played his sister and is amazing in it.
Demon King Daimao,Nadja and Nadja are my top 2 favs
Demon King Daimao,I would pay stupid money for a Nadja doll. Even being simple and just saying like ten lines.
Demon King Daimao,"Look for [Year Friends ](https://youtu.be/ROwW1O0chOk) on YouTube. It's (12 episodes) full of Nadja (Natasha). After that, Stath Lets Flats."
Demon King Daimao,"I only came into this thread to upvote the first person I seen say ""BAT!"""
Demon King Daimao,Mailer demon!!!
Demon King Daimao,Arise!
Demon King Daimao,and now I am a WIZARD!
Demon King Daimao,But what an entrance! He’s so good in IT Crowd
Demon King Daimao,Work Outing is probably one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen
Demon King Daimao,She's a one track lover......
Demon King Daimao,It's also bookmarked to watch it eventually and it definitely sounds like something that could be amazing thank you
Demon King Daimao,I just found out about this series
Demon King Daimao,"To each their own, but I really enjoyed three and four. Yes, there are starting to be some misses among the hits, but it still hits very good very often!"
Demon King Daimao,"Late to this thread but I also had a similar feeling at the beginning of season 3, but i think some twists in the last 3 episodes recontextualize the season and resolve some of the issues i had. the Guillermo dynamic still is a little weird though not as a good as the first two seasons"
Demon King Daimao,The thing with this show is that they have these big emotional moments for characters in ridiculous situations. They do a great job of sneaking that in.
Demon King Daimao,Where did you find Wellington Paranormal?
Demon King Daimao,"Does it start to catch its stride a few episodes in? It seemed a little over the tops sitcom cheesy for me the first two episodes. I LOVE Richard ayoade, so I want to like the show"
Demon King Daimao,You’ve missed out on the Demon Email and the emotional vampire vs an online troll ☹️
Demon King Daimao,How much did you watch? I was pretty iffy on it until episode 6 where it immediately starts to pick up. Season 2 is all bangers all the time
Demon King Daimao,"Here with ya buddy.  I hit all the standard comedy fares and absolute love them.  Parks and rec,
Community, iasip, the league, curb - whatever.  I love all the well rated highly recommended
Comedies.

This show just doesnt hit for me.  At all.  I dont think i laughed out loud once the entire first season.  And the movie was a solid 8-9/10.

No idea why.  I might even try and push theough the second season.  But looking at the ratings, I just think its one of those ‘not for me’ shows."
Demon King Daimao,"I remember some people saying this while it was airing, I rewatched the first 3 seasons before Season 4 aired and season 3 was just as good as the first two seasons. Maybe expectations were too high after Jackie Daytona, maybe some people just don't like new things, who knows. But go rewatch Season 3, it's great."
Demon King Daimao,"To be fair, a funeral is funnier then BBT."
Demon King Daimao,"the best of little Colin was him singing at the nightclub, then hitting puberty


but little Colin did give us the hypnotizing the people from the school, soooo yeah"
Demon King Daimao,I looooved little Colin! It was so funny and well done.
Demon King Daimao,"That whole scene where she's just following him and watching him through the window while he's amusing himself. When she brought out that massive camera, I nearly wet myself.

Sorry if that was a bit too graphic..."
Demon King Daimao,Name like a weak ejaculation.
Demon King Daimao,"""Oh, multipack!"""
Demon King Daimao,"It's an absolute joy that show, I'm due a rewatch."
Demon King Daimao,That is definitely something I need in my life!
Demon King Daimao,>!FAAaaAATHERRRRRRRR!<
Demon King Daimao,"""I wonder if it's loaded"" \*fires gun 6 times in own mouth\* is probably one of my favorite scenes from that series"
Demon King Daimao,"It's pretty close to a perfect sitcom episode. The way everything gets progressively worse  and in the end it all comes neatly together is just beautiful. And there's so many iconic jokes, the episode is super tight."
Demon King Daimao,"Shit, also, the Mighty Boosh. Those are both pretty early in Matt Berrys career."
Demon King Daimao,Snuff box too if you can find it on one of the apps
Demon King Daimao,"it could be just me, i also didnt like our flag means death. i wish they would make the what we do in the moonlight movie thou."
Demon King Daimao,"In the UK, on Sky or NowTV"
Demon King Daimao,I watched it on HBO Max. Not sure if it’s still on there though.
Demon King Daimao,Watch until season 2 episode 1. If that one doesn't make you laugh you are dead inside.
Demon King Daimao,I think it does. Keep at it. We love him too! There are quite a few episodes that demonstrate the breadth of his talent. Enjoy!
Demon King Daimao,"The theatrical overacting is kind of deliberate. It can be a jarring choice at first, but you get used to it."
Demon King Daimao,Definitely!
Demon King Daimao,"I think I watched 3 episodes. That's not much, but I didn't see any discussion online about how the first few episodes are dull (e.g. Seinfeld), so I decided to drop it. I might give it a second chance one day."
Demon King Daimao,"> I dont think i laughed out loud once the entire first season.

As somebody who loves the show... first season was more of a background thing for me. I did not laugh too much, but I felt it had the potential to be good.

Season 2 onwards, however: worth your time. Give it a try sometime."
Ushio and Tora,"Been putting it off because my watch slot was first filled with Made in Abyss and now with Chainsaw Man.

It does sound interesting enough to give a try, as I enjoyed similar shows in the past. Good to see a grounded review so I won't be too hyped!"
Ushio and Tora,"I liked it.  Well animated, the gimmick very quickly stops feeling like a 'get out of jail free card' as they enemy has some of their own tricks.  It's got good tension which is what I liked the most.  And I liked the setting of a small island community, perfect for a kind of Lovecraftian horror story, which is revealed about mid way through the story.  Also, nice to have a cast that's not entirely comprised of high school aged kids."
Ushio and Tora,I think you'll find a much better discussion for it on r/anime
Ushio and Tora,I loved it! Really recommend it
Ushio and Tora,"I’m only 5 episodes in, but I’m greatly enjoying it so far."
Ushio and Tora,"My first thought is I am surprise this is going to air on Disney plus in America. 

I loved it. Don’t get me wrong. I just feel like this anime’s content does not match the Disney plus brand"
Ushio and Tora,"The first half was great. 

The second half was a letdown. It felt massively rushed which caused a lot of the big moments to miss the mark.

Still an overall good show though."
Ushio and Tora,"It'll most likely be released on Hulu whenever it finally comes out, not Disney+. Disney has never actually claimed that it'll be released on Disney+ in the US, and even when they had said Tatami Time Machine Blues was going to be added to Disney+ in the US earlier this month, it ended up actually getting added to Hulu instead."
Ushio and Tora,This is their 31 Days of Oscar schedule and looks like  there’s no overall theme this year but the 4 movies starting at 8ish are “versus” each other so the 8ish movie and the 10ish movie have a theme and so do the Midnight-ish and 2ish movies.
Outlander,Will be interesting to calculate the Rapes per Episode ratio when this is over.
Outlander,"As soon as they got to America, I stopped giving a shit. Really too bad, what came before was pretty good."
Outlander,"Clearly I’m the minority on this, but based on the book’s ending, season 8 finishing it off is perfect."
Outlander,">In addition, Starz has ordered to series Outlander: Blood of My Blood, a prequel centered on the love story of Jamie Fraser’s parents, Ellen MacKenzie and Brian Fraser.

Something tells me these two won't do much globetrotting? Which is a good sign,  that's where this series lost the plot for me. I'll tune in to see if Brian is as hot shirtless as his son will end up being. They better cast this well."
Outlander,"Who the fuck asked for a prequel of that?? The main appeal of the story was always thr time travel stuff, and we already know their story. Give us Lord John Grey, damn it!"
Outlander,"That seems unfortunate, Diana Gabaldon is writing the 10th and supposedly final book, so they're either going to end the show on the book 8 storyline leaving the show effectively unfinished or they're going to cram 8 and 9 storylines and try to GOT it with an 'outline' for the 10th into one season unless Gabaldon gets it out in time, which doesn't seem likely given the length in between the previous ones. 

Though yeah, the first season when they get to America was fine but after that it's been meh."
Outlander,"Why is every thread about an even slightly well known show on reddit just filled with ""I stopped watching comments""?

Why are you reading this or posting lol? Gotta be the most annoying reddit behavior."
Outlander,Oh ok. Season 7 is out this year and the. It ends the season after. I tapped out in episode one of season 5. I might try getting back in
Outlander,I don’t know if there are any commenters who read the books but if anyone has… I think the prequel will be so good… I can’t wait to meet young Jenny!
Outlander,"Good that it's ending, the show became really stale when they left for the colonies, and let's not even mention the rape. I tapped out towards the end of S4 and beginning of S5 (and yikes it gets much worse apparently). I didn't find the new characters to be engaging either, and the show really became ""who's gonna get raped this season/episode?"". Gabaldon must have some rape fetish or something. That said I do very much like the two main characters and their actors, and I hope they can get more projects in the future. I might check out the prequel if the setting goes back to Scotland, and granted if rape isn't used as a plot tool."
Outlander,the blood of my blood is my blood
Outlander,"I enjoyed the first 3 seasons, season 4 was ok. It should have ended there."
Outlander,"maybe they can adapt the last two books as movies once the last one is out 

better to end now than the keep going and run out of material and end up like game of thrones"
Outlander,"I read the books a few years ago and I don’t remember what book it’s in , I think it’s book 8, but is that where the lord John and Claire side quest takes place ?"
Outlander,"This show was so hard to watch, the pacing was terrible, the sensationalized and unnecessary sexual Violence, the female lead’s overacting… I can’t believe how many people loved it."
Outlander,"""Zero episodes without rape is our goal ""

Show runner"
Outlander,"I'm so glad that the show lasted for 8 seasons since lots of shows get cancelled quickly. Even though I'm sad that it's ending and we won't get to see all the books on our screens, I must say a huge congratulations to everyone involved! The cinematography, costumes, locations, music, casting and performances were incredible and really set the bar high. You should all be really proud of yourselves - this show is genuinely beautiful!"
Outlander,Rapelander's ending?
Outlander,Guess they got tired of all the raping. Surprised it took 8 seasons
Outlander,When is book 10 being released? Would be nice to capture it all!
Outlander,I tapped out during season four when Claire jumps off of a ship in the middle of the night and swims to the island where Jamie randomly is. Or am I remembering that wrong? I remember there was some outlandish contrivance and I couldn’t watch anymore.
Outlander,"Not long before I moved to Scotland, my then-fiancée suggested that I watch *Outlander*. She had genuinely enjoyed  it… but she was also playing a subtle prank on me.

See, she had (correctly) predicted that my announcement to my coworkers would prompt some of them to reference the show, and boy, did they ever. Over the span of the following week, I must have spent an entire day’s worth of time discussing “Scottish history,” and I was frequently encouraged to visit Inverness. Someone even made the not-at-all-creepy suggestion that I seek out and explore Wentworth Prison – which isn’t a real place – and perhaps locate Jamie’s cell.

Suffice it to say that I never did manage to do that.

Anyway, I didn’t keep up with the series, but based on what I’ve heard in the time since, we’ve probably passed the point where it should have concluded. As I understand it, folks started to lose interest when *Outlander* lost Scotland."
Outlander,Let’s just hope the prequel stays in Scotland. When Claire and Jamie got to America the show got a lot less interesting.
Outlander,"We didn't make it to season 3, I'm actually surprised to learn this is still on air. 

Was a fun premise."
Outlander,Yes
Outlander,Really feel like they milked this shit to the absolute bone
Outlander,Didn't the show effectively end a few seasons ago when everyone stopped caring?
Outlander,"so this guy gets another caprica, huh?"
Outlander,I liked the show until it moved to America.
Outlander,"For a show about a time traveler, Claire does surprisingly little to utilize her knowledge of history. I mean, penacilan antibiotics a couple centuries early is a great idea, but I feel like she could have done a lot more interesting stuff."
Outlander,Christ don’t even. The season 5 finale was the last straw
Outlander,"I thought Game of Thrones was bad with sexual violence. This show seemed like it was every episode. My wife stopped at the start of season 2, it became too much for her and me included to be honest"
Outlander,I think all of the main characters have been at this point.
Outlander,c-calculate the what
Outlander,Been 2 episodes since a rape(season 3).  Must be a record.
Outlander,"That's why I stopped watching it. Literally every member of that family was brutally raped at one point or another. Men, women, children... It was too much for me."
Outlander,"Yeah, that's why I'll never watch this show"
Outlander,"When this first came out I said to a girl on tinder that a show about a woman going back in time by herself would have a shit load of rape. She blocked me and I have never thought about this show since. 

I fuckin told you so tinder girl"
Outlander,[deleted]
Outlander,I've been pissed about the plot since coming to the Colonies being that Claire knows they are in the middle of what will be a war zone in the coming years.  Go west and discover gold 80 years early or something.
Outlander,The show was Scottish landscape porn with pretty people playing make believe and they… decided to leave Scotland? Bad choice
Outlander,"Yes, the show lost its exotic edge for people like me once they got to America. I realize they loosely follow the books, and fans of the books would have conniption fits if the producers had elected not to follow the plotline as laid out, so they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

There was a moment in season 4 when the Claire character winds up meeting George Washington before the Revolutionary War, and tells her daughter about it. The daughter just shakes her head in disinterest. And that captured my feelings completely."
Outlander,"Me, too. The first two seasons were great, but then it went more and more downhill. I think the last season I watched a bit of was season 5. I just skipped though it. Didn't watch the whole episodes anymore.

It was just so much better when they were in Scotland and the storyline about trying to prevent the big war and England winning was great. There was a much bigger scale to everything. Also the time travel then was more interesting and mysterious.

Also moving to the USA kind of made them the bad guys. At the start of the series the Scots were the victims which were invaded and killed. And in the USA they were part of the group of people who were killing the natives and stealing their land. Also part of the group of people who had slaves. One relative was even directly a slave owner."
Outlander,You're in the minority in these comments by even knowing that the books exist.
Outlander,"I agree, MOBY ending is perfect for the series"
Outlander,"Yeah Scotland was like a character in the first season, when they left the show didn’t feel the same"
Outlander,I loved the show until they set sail.  I just wanted more Scotland.
Outlander,"I guess I'm in the minority, as the show really hooked me after they left Scotland. If the entire show had been various goings-on at that castle like in Season 1, I never would've stuck with it"
Outlander,No time travel.  I’m out.
Outlander,"I agree. I don't like the series much, I do like the books. John Grey is one of my favorite characters...eventually

I would love to see a Master Raymond book"
Outlander,I don’t remember what book it was but I am only interested in a very specific lord john and Claire sub plot. They better have it in the tv show
Outlander,"> Who the fuck asked for a prequel of that?? The main appeal of the story was always thr time travel stuff, and we already know their story. Give us Lord John Grey, damn it!

Disagree. Scotland was the main appeal"
Outlander,They could come back and make a movie like Downton Abbey later.
Outlander,"Plus - there are things they introduced early on in the show (like that ghost figure in the pilot episode) and if I’m not mistaken, that hasn’t been addressed in the books yet and Diana was going to address it in the 10th book. So they are either going to spoil the book, address it differently then the book - or not address it at all. 

(If I’m wrong about it not being addressed in the book yet - please don’t tell me how it’s addressed! I haven’t read them)"
Outlander,"According those who read book 8, it's ending would make a good end point for the series."
Outlander,"Reddit heavily skews 18-35 year old male. Not in the slightest the target demographic for a show like Outlander. Unfortunately, the concept of “*some people like some things and some people don’t and that’s ok*” is a foreign concept to a ton of redditors."
Outlander,It’s like when someone asks a question and there’s fifty comments with the answer lol like guys we get it
Outlander,"Probably residual bitterness. I can say for myself, the Walking Dead remains a bitter memory because it's absolutely up my alley and the first season was so promising and then they completely fucked it up and it kept just... existing... like a shambling walker. There's still some resentment and there's validation going into a thread and seeing the hatewatchers confirm they never managed to fix it. ""Good, I didn't waste too much time continuing to watch."""
Outlander,[deleted]
Outlander,Very valid for this particular show though. I'm up to date but I've been hate watching it for two seasons.
Outlander,Because I am annoyed i invested time in the show for nothing am expressing it.
Outlander,Because it allows you to engage in your attention-seeking contrarianism.
Outlander,"If i remember correctly the season 7 will have 16 episodes and it will premiere in summer 2023.

My money is that they will do this:

\- split season 7 in 2 parts:

* first batch of 8 episodes in summer 2023
* second batch of 8 episodes in early 2024

\-Season 8 in later 2024 or early 2025.

\-The prequel series will premiere between season 7 and season 8.

&#x200B;

So i think you might have to wait a while if you plan to watch after season 8 ends."
Outlander,Season 6 doesn’t really have a resolution because Covid shit down production
Outlander,You tapped out at the right time to be honest. Show fell off hard.
Outlander,I don't think that there are any other commenters here who have read the books. I'm with you- meeting young Jenny will be amazing!
Outlander,"I have read all the books, most several times. I start at the beginning every time a new book comes out . . . I have zero interest in the prequel"
Outlander,Ron Moore left then. They started using green screens and bad wigs. Budget cuts and terrible decisions.
Outlander,"Based on how long it’s taken her to write the other ones, not until 2026 at the earliest with 2028 being more likely."
Outlander,"> I thought Game of Thrones was bad with sexual violence.

Believe me when I say that they toned it way, WAY down from the books."
Outlander,The worst was the scene with the grave… although I must say the >!slaves being forced to have sex and beat each other!< was shocking
Outlander,"It's so weird because half the show is a bubbly romance, and the other half is trauma porn"
Outlander,You guys are gonna mess around and talk me into watching this thing.
Outlander,It's what Outlander uses instead of Nielsen.
Outlander,Don’t get too comfortable
Outlander,"Tbf, that’s a fucking weird thing to say to someone you’re just starting to meet. Women don’t want to hear about rape. They especially don’t want to hear about rape from someone they’re not very familiar with. 

I don’t blame her for blocking you."
Outlander,Lol no shit you got blocked dude why the fuck are you bringing up rape in a tinder convo you dipshit 😂
Outlander,"If I were a girl on tinder talking to a dude and he randomly brought up rape I’d block his ass too.

Women have the right to be nervous when some ignorant idiot says something weird in regards to something that’s a constant fear for them while going through life, especially if that idiot is on a dating app."
Outlander,Uhm this comment is hardly relevant
Outlander,"They stay in the colonies because the  Louisiana Purchase wouldn't take place for another 27 years, thats a huge chunk of French territory they would have to cross.  Mexico's border would reach as far north as Oregon.  Other wagon trails to the west coast wouldn't exist for decades.  So even if they did want to travel to the west coast, they have to deal with hostile natives, hostile French and Spanish using them for target practice, with zero help from anyone."
Outlander,Also why take part in the colonization in the first place? That is kind of an asshole move. They took for themselves a large part of stolen land.
Outlander,Almost no one actually found gold. She'd end up poor or dead. Going to America was just stupid over all at that time
Outlander,It is getting good again!
Outlander,"In the books there is a 20 year time jump in book 2 in order to put the characters in place to go to America in time for the revolution. 

But that also made the main characters over 50 for most of the series. Which I always thought was a weird choice."
Outlander,Actually it’s still all filmed in Scotland.
Outlander,"I think a lot of the Appalachian scenery in the American seasons qualifies as ""landscape porn"", too."
Outlander,"It is still filmed all in Scotland, made to look like a mountain settlement in North Carolina"
Outlander,"Also time travel was a big draw,"
Outlander,"no, not a bad choice. first, they still film in Scotland lol. that has never changed. second, Culloden ended the Highlander culture and war is a huge aspect of this series. there was no significant conflict happening after Culloden. so it makes way more sense for them to move to America, where the Revolution is about to occur. yes, they could have sped up the Revolution, but bc war and political conflict is central to Outlander it makes sense. there was literally nothing happening in Scotland. and the Revolution also presents Jamie with the conflict of his oath to the Crown vs. his loyalty to the colonists. and describing the shoe as Scottish landscape porn is super reductive. i don’t see how anyone who watched the show could call it that."
Outlander,"From what I've read, even book fans don't love the later books."
Outlander,I loved it when it was taking place in Scotland. It seemed like a really mysterious place and about a historical political struggle I didn't know anything about so I learned a lot. But then the American seasons just fell flat.
Outlander,"For me it got better.

I loved seasons 1&2, Scotland, Paris…. Season 3, the Caribbean stuff in the second half with the witchy woman was TERRIBLE. Just such awful writing. It really put me off.

Since getting to America I think the show has been far more consistently interesting, better written, etc."
Outlander,By modern standards there are no good or bad guys. People lived by the notion conquer or be conquered. I’m a historian and nothing is at all that simple.
Outlander,"I did enjoy the France part quite a bit (rape notwithstanding), but it lost me when they got to America. I just can't get past the premise of having historical knowledge that a horrible war is about to break out and still choosing to settle there. Why would you do that and why would you drag your daughter into it as well?

Oh, and she built her cottage on stolen land as well, knowing everything she knows about Native Americans. That part was gross, too."
Outlander,Has that been confirmed? That sucks if so and takes a lot of the appeal out of it for me as well. I want them to time travel to 2023 occasionally and have their minds blown by friggin' lasers.
Outlander,I think they are from some clips I saw of Jamie and John
Outlander,"Downton was original though, they didn't have books to draw from, so it could've ended whenever they wanted, the movies are just supplemental to it and mostly operate on their own, you don't need to watch them to watch the show. Outlander needs to finish the source material or it's unfinished. If it ends up being a theatrical or (most likely) tv movie, cool, but it can't be 4-5 years later to finish a story. Season 8 should've been more episodes to try incorporate the important book 9 stuff and then once book 10 is done, they could try and make a movie or a sequel limited series."
Outlander,The ghost watching Claire from the street?
Outlander,"Read them! They ae so good, and for the most part, get better as the series goes on"
Outlander,"37 yo M here, I love the show.  But I do miss the Scotland parts.   They do seem wilder, darker, and just better overall.  The colonies are too bright and ""sanitary"" if that makes any sense."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"As much as people like to drag on Matt Lucas, the show's developed a more more system level problem than the hosts.  What started as the joy of watching amateur bakers has become professional level artists struggling to defy time and theromodynamics because Paul went on holiday and became an expert on something."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Weird guys like Noel need someone more grounded to play off.  That's why the Noel Matt duo just didn't really click, they were both out there.  Hopefully she brings a bit more balance."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"They only thing I know her from is the hilarious interview she had with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling: https://youtu.be/bAb8KIhgVAI

Seems like a great choice and I can def see a good back and forth with Noel happening."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Still to this day miss Mel and Sue.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I never watched the earlier seasons, but I really grew to love Noel and Sandi. Both of them had such calming voices for the narration, were quick, and honestly quite funny at moments. Losing Sandi for Matt was a huge blow. Hopefully this recaptures some of the magic!"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Noel: Welcome back to the Great British Bake Off with our new co-host Alison Hammond, are you excited to be here Alison?

Alison:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
Secrets of Great British Castles,I hope they really cut down on the ‘skits’. Last year was brutal.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Read through the comments on this, and I’m honestly surprised at all the hate for Matt. Maybe I’m crazy, but I really liked him as a co-host and thought he added a lot to the show."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I think it's a good fit. She's warm and cheerful and likeable. But she'll have to dial it down a bit as she has a big personality.

Intrigued to see how she clicks with Noel. Their little comedy bits could be great or could be painfully awkward. Although Noel gets on great with Matt and their little skits were rarely actually funny.

At least she'll be a bright and sunshiney presence. Matt always looked very out of his comfort zone."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Is she the one who had that super fun interview with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling during their Blade Runner 2049 press tour?
Secrets of Great British Castles,I’m sure he was nice guy but he wasn’t funny. It doesn’t have anything to do with playing off Noel. When he was one on one with contestants he wasn’t funny and lot of what he said just didn’t even make sense. I welcome the change. I miss sandy. She and noel were perfect together.
Secrets of Great British Castles,I really liked Noel and Sandi.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Good decision IMO. Matt Lucas didn't suit the show very well and I've no doubt Hammond will fit better.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"The show was *so good* with Mary Berry and Sue & Mel. Channel 4, unsurprisingly, turned it into complete rubbish."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I'll give her a chance but I don't see her having the calm quick wit that made Mel, Sue and Sandi so great, but the show itself needs to address the issues and go back to what made it so popular, good honest baking."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I liked Matt Lucas, and i'm not familiar with Alison, but Noel Fielding is the reason I watch the show, so I'm fine with the change."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Does this mean it'll be less jokey or more jokey?
Secrets of Great British Castles,"A good start to refreshing the show as the last two series have been poor - thanks to odd challenges with impossible deadlines. 

I don't want drama. I just want nice people making yummy things. 

Alison will hopefully bring back the Mummy touch that was missing when Sandi left."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Long as Noel is there I’m happy
Secrets of Great British Castles,I actually really enjoyed Matt. Here's hoping there aren't any more cooking challenges
Secrets of Great British Castles,"My favorite Matt Lucas moment was when he asked a contestant if they wanted to hear the Flintstones theme song in German, and then recited the entire thing from memory"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I’ll hold my judgement until i see her in action, but from what I’ve seen of her sees pretty marmite to me."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I think this is a good move.

I think Matt Lucas did okay but most of the time it felt more like he was just there to goof off and do terrible celebrity impressions.

What I really like about Noel (and all the previous hosts) is that he gets the bakers to feel comfortable and open up a bit and play to the camera, which is what a GBB host’s primary goal should be."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Nothing against Matt but I was getting sick of him as a host so this is a welcomed change. Hope they tone down the cringey gimmick intros too. They were cheeky when it was Mel and Sue and now they’re just getting downright embarrassing. Show’s losing a bit of its original spirit.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I’ve seen her cooking videos, and yes she is chaotically hilarious, this is an upgrade to the show overall imo"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Very happy with this, she is one of the best TV personalities around."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"ah, man, I didn't like Matt at first but felt like he was really settling in. I'm sure she's gonna be good too though! Maybe one of these days they can get Greg Davies to be a host lol"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I love Noel, think he does a great job. While I think Hammond will do just fine and agree Matt had to go, no one will ever live up to Mel and Sue.  IMO."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I liked matt in the end, but she's a much better fit"
Secrets of Great British Castles,I know it isn’t a popular opinion but I loved how weird Noel and Matt were together. Two wild cards roaming the tent lol
Secrets of Great British Castles,I do love Alison Hammond
Secrets of Great British Castles,If they had gone with James Acaster I might have actually watched the show just to see it devolve into absolute madness.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Sorta glad Matt is fired. Really didn’t find him
In any way funny. Whereas Noel is."
Secrets of Great British Castles,I love Matt Lucus! They had so much chemistry!
Secrets of Great British Castles,Goddamn I really dislike Alison Hammond. She's a z tier presenter
Secrets of Great British Castles,"This is one of those decisions where once you hear about it, you wonder why it didn't happen years ago."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Where will I find my translucent four-limbed egg now?
Secrets of Great British Castles,Not Nardole!
Secrets of Great British Castles,I like Matt Lucas well enough. It is a goofy show and he didn't stick out too much. But I guess there are enough people who are not happy with him. As long as Fielding is there I am happy.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"orite, ya boonch a twonks!"
Secrets of Great British Castles,I would just like to say that in Canada we are still waiting for season 13 to air. Why do they torture us like this!!!
Secrets of Great British Castles,"“Can’t fire me, I am the only gay in the village!”"
Secrets of Great British Castles,Love Matt but looking forward to Alison!
Secrets of Great British Castles,Noel and Sandy were the best duo no one can convince me otherwise
Secrets of Great British Castles,[removed]
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Mat was certainly and issue, but they've got deeper problems for the show. Everything is too quick, we don't learn anything about baking anymore i.e no interesting historical facts or little segments about a particular challenge. We don't see Paul and prue offering friendly advice anymore, there hardly seems to be any interaction. Anything that isnt somebody desperately saying ""oh man I'm really having a hard time with this"" or ""well done!"" Seems to be cut out. It's a very barebones show now

Edit: oh and Paul is now a meme. Everything that made it a nice competition show is nearly gone"
Secrets of Great British Castles,Aw I liked him :(
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Seriously?! I finally made it to season 11 of Doctor Who recently and fell in love with Nardole. Prior to watching that season, I wasn't the biggest Matt Lucas fan."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Wish it was Dawn French instead
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I don't know much about her, but there's no way she's as bad as Lucas, maybe the least funny person on earth."
Secrets of Great British Castles,I think im the only person in the UK who can’t stand Alison Hammond.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Aw, yay! I like her. I think she'll be a good addition to the show. I have to say I really started to despise the way that Matt Lucas was being on the show, I felt like he was directed to be purposely disruptive and he also didn't seem very warm with people, and I didn't find him that funny.  And by the end of the last season I was generally wondering what the point was. I felt like he never settled into the chemistry with Noel or the contestants in the same way that some previous hosts had done."
Secrets of Great British Castles,As if it wasnt cringey enough already.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Love this.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Too bad, he was hilarious."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Absolutely talentless. I cannot understand how she gets work. Years on the tv exposed to so much information and learning and yet seems to be the same imbecilic moron she was on her first day on screen. 

Classic ‘I have no discernible talent but I can make loud noises!’ Broadcaster"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"She's gonna be so great with the contestants, looking forward to it :D"
Secrets of Great British Castles,Alison is AMAZING. What a win.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Oooh, I like her.  She's got an amazing personality.  And seems to make everyone feel welcome when she's around."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"No real comedians want this gig? It seems like we’re getting screwed with a former reality star, bummer."
Secrets of Great British Castles,I anyone still watching though?
Secrets of Great British Castles,Thank goodness. Matt was horrible.
Secrets of Great British Castles,There’ll be nothing left to judge
Secrets of Great British Castles,Alison Hammond is not the right fit for this show. Her accent will do no end of people’s heads in.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Isn't the show called the Great British Baking Show?
Secrets of Great British Castles,WE LOVE GOOD NEWS!
Secrets of Great British Castles,Pity bakeoff is dogshit now
Secrets of Great British Castles,"He was never quite right to me…he was funny in Bridesmaids, but I found him to be a little weird on GBBO."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Matt Lucas is trash.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"She's a great fit, very light hearted, funny, always herself and just seems like a nice person."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Matt Lucas is the first male cast member to ever be replaced.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Don’t think I’ll ever forgive Matt Lucas for trying to kidnap Abed to England
Secrets of Great British Castles,"Matt Lucas was awful, something creepy about him."
Secrets of Great British Castles,idk how Matt Lucas is even around much less on bake off
Secrets of Great British Castles,"well, she does look like someone who knows about cakes and pies"
Secrets of Great British Castles,Thank GOD. He was so fucking terrible
Secrets of Great British Castles,[deleted]
Secrets of Great British Castles,Her personality grates on my nerves at the best of times. Hard pass.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Blackwashing
Secrets of Great British Castles,[deleted]
Secrets of Great British Castles,Alison Hammond makes my willy go stiff
Secrets of Great British Castles,i wonder how creepy bald giant baby looking dude will do with this woman
Secrets of Great British Castles,L
Secrets of Great British Castles,This show can do anything and I will still love it and I don't know why. This is my favorite thread I have read all year on Reddit.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Mega upgrade.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I think he was fine, this is just what they do; replace the co host every few seasons."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Thank God.  He is creepy AF.  And not funny.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"From what I've seen of her, I really like her. I think she'll be amazing at clicking with the contestants who don't necessarily vibe with Noel's sense of humour, which is something we got with Sandi and with Mel and Sue. I think she'll also be even better than Noel at getting a little of the hot air out of Paul, which I think the show badly needs. Matt was fine, but his own brand of absurd. Personally found him a bit off-putting. Like he'd snuck something that doesn't belong anywhere near food into your icing and was just lurking around until you found it. 

Hope the show also goes back to celebrating baking. I'm tired of absurd themed weeks and dishes, toi and of the attitude that what's going on is a little silly. The people in the tent love what they do and they're very good at it. They don't need a host or judge to tell them every few episodes that they ""don't like sweets."" Canadian Bake-Off still has some work to do on being as educational/informative, but it's outpaced the original at highlighting the joy in the process and the product."
Secrets of Great British Castles,I would like to see Stephen Merchant give it a go as co-host.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Noel is there I’m happy
Secrets of Great British Castles,"You need to make a smorgasbord of specific Danish breads that haven’t been eaten since the 14th century, which require 24 hours proofing in Nordic conditions. The runway at Luton is currently melting and you have 25 minutes to do them in.

A few moments later…

Paul: “this isn’t like how they are in Aalborg. I just got back from there, so I’d know. You’ve let them get too warm - it gets quite cold out there. And to top it off, they’re underprooved”

(Although to be fair, the lemon meringue tart challenge was good - simple, easy and no recipe. Just make it)"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"They never, ever give anyone sufficient time and then complain that they don’t see finished products presented.  They do the same thing on Bake Off: Professionals.  If it takes a certain amount of time to make sure something is baked and then cooled, and then you give them 30 minutes less than that, there is just no way to make that work.

It’s also their insistence on not repeating challenges, so they get more and more complicated and strange.  The all time weirdest was the “cake bust”."
Secrets of Great British Castles,Taakos!
Secrets of Great British Castles,Kinda poetic for a studio to take something wholesome and fun and enjoyable for everyone and slowly make it more and more difficult until everyone is struggling and crying and nobody likes it anymore.
Secrets of Great British Castles,Agreed!! Tone-deaf cultural weeks and constant striving for new challenges are losing what made the show great.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I rewatched the series and on a early series they had to make *cupcakes*. While I do like challenges that are more interesting than that, each series’ winners are becoming more and more unrelatable (because of their professional-level talent). I want true amateurs goddammit!"
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I still miss Sue and Mell as the hosts. In my opinion the show just became less after the channel 4 move. The comedy sketches that became a thing with Noel, sandy and Matt just aren’t funny to me.  I prefer the banter and interaction between the hosts, judges.

Nowadays I prefer the su2c bake off. It’s less stressful and it’s just joyful to watch."
Secrets of Great British Castles,They lost me with the smores.
Secrets of Great British Castles,"I’m so sick of the rotating hosts. I still miss Sandy, she and Noel has such great chemistry. I don’t care much about the hosts but they do stand out when it’s awkward. It’s been awkward. 

I really miss when it was actual amateur bakers too. I was discussing this with my husband the other day. I call the early bakers “Sarah jane” after one of the contestants, I don’t know why I singled her out. But we’re always saying things like “Sarah Jane could never” when they pull out wild bakes."
Secrets of Great British Castles,"A subtle sign of this is how often they show the baker's crying now. Back in the Mel and Sue days, they'd start screaming curse words to prevent the production team from using the footage. Now, you see someone crying almost every episode like any American cooking show. Nobody should be crying on a joyful show."
Power,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
Power,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."
Power,Mance Rayder!
Power,Is Rory Kinnear gonna give birth to himself from his Rory Kinussy like in Men cuz if so i need to binge s1 fast.
Power,Can they add an interesting story?
Power,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
Power,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
Power,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
Power,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
Power,Mance!
Power,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
Power,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
Power,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
Power,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
Power,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
Power,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
Power,Can they add some new writers?
Power,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
Power,That show is dead.
Power,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
Power,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
Power,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
Power,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
Power,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
Power,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
Power,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
Power,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
Power,How wasn't this cancelled
Power,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
Power,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
Power,Just cancel it already
Power,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
Power,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
Power,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
Power,how'd this trash get a second session?
Power,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
Power,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
Power,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
Power,Did they add new writers
Power,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
Power,Good actors but no thank you.
Power,"Yeah, but did they hire any good writers?"
Power,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
Power,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
Power,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
Power,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
Power,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
Power,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
Power,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
Power,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
Power,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
Power,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
Power,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
Power,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
Power,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
Power,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
Power,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
Power,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
Power,So the flop continues....
Power,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
Power,Are they hiring better writers?
Power,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
Power,Long haired elves or GTFO
Power,"I dug this show.  Sorry, my comment is not a pithy negging one-liner."
Power,Yea I’d be cautious attaching my name to that pos.
Power,"Rory Kinear will never be the same for me after watching Men. If you've seen it, you know why."
Power,Rory Kinnear was so bloody great in *Penny Dreadful* that the fact he didn’t win an Emmy (or Eva Green) just shows be how worthless award shows are.
Power,From the thumbnail it looked like Colin Robinson. Was curious the direction they’d be going with energy vampires.
Power,I think it’s the law that every old times HBO show wit swords and horses has to have hinds in it.
Power,Did they add any new writers
Power,Great stuff!!
Power,"It doesn't matter how many great actors they throw at this huge, stinking turd, it's still gonna be a huge, stinking turd!"
Power,"Can't have someone in that show doing a half decent Irish accent, so Ciaran can't be a harfoot anywho"
Power,Is the Show good?
Power,Mance effing Rayder
Power,so they didn't cancel season 2. why?
Power,"More majestic horse rides, please."
Power,Siiiiigh
Power,"Reddit's obsession with this show continues to blow my mind. Even the people who love it don't care about it as much as the people who hate it.

Don't you all get tired of saying the same thing over and over again?"
Power,"It doesn't matter what they do going forward, after 5 episodes, I couldn't take it anymore."
Power,Who cares about this dogwater show. It doesn't deserve the name LOTR
Power,"Cool. I won’t watch this season, either."
Power,this show sucks ass they're getting wasted
Power,Won't change the writing.
Power,Wait. How is there a season 2 after the massive train wreck that season 1 was?
Power,Maybe the story will be better
Power,"Great show, despite what the smoothbrains on reddit think. The visuals and costumes were amazing."
Power,"They could add the entire cast of the original movies and I still wouldn't watch this hot garbage. They ruined it before it even got off the ground with those Tolkien-hating show runners and writers who thought they could actually one-up Tolkien with his own world building and characterizations. Galadriel as presented as the heroic female lead of this crap is not just a pale shadow of what is represented in the books, she's a complete bastardization of her. As to the rest...just crap after crap after crap. I definitely won't be coming around for season 2. When it comes to adapting fantasy ""franchises"" such as this and Wheel of Time, Amazon has no clue what they are doing and neither do the show runners they hire."
Power,"More diversity castings, whata surprise… just make a portion set in the damn east if you want dark people in lotr, theyre not in the west… the blue wizards could be spotlighted aswell"
Power,I think I’m the only one on Reddit that genuinely enjoyed the show.
Power,Who cares? Travesty they are going to make another season.
Power,"If they want to throw millions away and see it come back, hire whoever made *the Last Of Us*, they have a good story and a good cast"
Power,"Well it wasnt exactly better actors this show neede.. Oh well it did, but it needed better writers first and foremost !"
Power,Still going to be mid though…
Power,Apparently they can't stop until they ruin the next big cultural mythical franchise. I already feel sorry that such a great actor as Ciaran will waste his energy on that guaranteed train wreck.
Power,Have they hired new writers yet?
Power,How the fuck did this even get cleared for a season 2?? I want to say 95% of the people that watched this show hated it and ripped on it. I guess they decided to go with the other 5% without a brain and said fuck yeah! tHeY wAnT mOrE
Power,How about hiring some writers who aren't complete morons?
Power,But will it not be shit? Maybe actually hire show runners that know what they are doing.
Power,Man they should stop spending so much money on good actors that will anyone need to work with boring and bad writing and hire better showrunners. You had a diamond and provided a plastic pebble.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,She's super hot right now after The Farewell. Good to keep her on the channel.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"God I hope Comedy Central figures their shit out soon, before it's time for *South Side*'s or *The Other Two*'s Season 3 renewal decision. They don't know how to market their shows, they don't license them to streamers, and after they've given a courtesy Season 2 there's no fruits of their garbage labor and these good shows they commission are put in a tough spot, e.g. *Detroiters*, which was cancelled after 2 seasons.

These shows should skew young, and they're locking them into a cable TV platform fewer and fewer young people use. Hopefully the merger with CBS saves them from themselves in some way.

edit: typo"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Where can I even watch this show. Looked at the Comedy Central website and no episodes are there. Looked at Hulu, nope. Even looked at *streaming sites* and nada. Is the only way to really watch it on the televsion itself?"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I don’t like this woman at all, I have no idea how she skirts away from the “cultural appropriation“ crowd. Just a privileged Asian woman, cohabitating black culture in speech with her “awwww sheeeeeeet” type nonsense. It’s pure cringe.  ￼"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,i like Awkwafina a lot but her new show does not look good.  it just seems like the writers think it's hilarious to make every(?) character as OBNOXIOUS and crass as possible and they think that that is funny.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I just today realized it's spelled Awkwa becsuse she's awkward...
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Black queen
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I mean she is good looking but she's also funny as well
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,*The Other Two* was one of my favorite shows of 2019 but nobody I knew had even heard of it. They have such great original shows that could be big hits if they had halfway decent marketing.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"100% agreed. If I could stream South Side, I'd be so happy."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"South Side is fantastic, I hope it doesn’t have the same fate as Detroiters which was also great. 

Also, if you like Tim Robinson you should watch I Think You Should Leave on Netflix. And his episode of The Characters."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,South Side was one of the funniest shows of 2019. I was so disappointed when I searched and saw almost no mentions of it on Reddit. They are SO bad at marketing their shit.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Here comes the part where I start to cry because someone mentioned Detroiters.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Kinda doubtful about this. CBS has really been pushing CBS All Access, which has been locking OK content behind a service that (anecdotally) nobody really uses to the best of my knowledge.

They really oughta partner more closely with Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu to get their stuff seen."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Looks like it officially doesn't debut until January 22nd.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,It hasnt premiered yet.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,So it just copies Sunny in Philly with a female lead.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"It's weird too because the thing that has catapulted her into the spotlight just now, *The Farewell*, managed to be funny while also mostly being winsome and thoughtful. She definitely *can* do that and people demonstrably love it."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,“But she’s so real and quirky!”
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"> also funny as well

I don't believe it. No one is *that* funny."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I think the ship is starting to sail on other outlets ""partnering"" with Netflix/Hulu like they did before. If you didn't do it before, you aren't now. Everyone wants to control their own stuff right now. There's a CBS All Access channel on Amazon Prime Video, which might be the closest.

Adding Viacom's library should help All Access, as should the CW stuff from CBS Studios they'll get like *Nancy Drew*. I wonder if down the road they combine with Showtime to do an HBO Max type deal."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Oh wow that explains it haha was confused by the 2nd season renewal. Thanks for the help!
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"BilltheCat, i've only seen maybe 4 or 5 eps. of Sunny in Philly and while i definitely take your point that the crass/obnoxious humor is similar (or identical?) to this new Awkwafina show, (only going by the promos for this new show) none of the supporting cast has comedic talent to carry off that crassness like they do in Philly.  

i don't think Awkwafina herself looks like she's doing a bad job in the show, it's almost the entire supporting cast (especially whoever is playing her grandmother) that seem to be trying WAY WAY too hard to be funny/""edgy""/crass. maybe i'm wrong though and the show itself will be good!  i do like BD Wong (who plays her dad) though a lot!"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Yep, some shows get renewed for another season before the current one has aired. I suppose it shows confidence by the network in the series."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Friends was a big hit. Later, The Office was a big hit."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Taxi, Cheers, MASH, Murphy Brown, Alice, Welcome Back Kotter, Night Court.

The workplace sitcom has been a staple for decades."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"There is just far far less community now and sitcoms tend to reflect situations that are relatable to people. 

The sad fact is since the 80s the copper wire has been stripped out of the walls with regular people having to do more to keep the dysfunctional economy going. More people will be able to relate to workplace situations than having a group of friends at this point.

Hell look at the front page of reddit where there normally is a thread on how to make friends as an adult. We're just a desocialised society"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"The dominant sitcom up to about five years ago was The Big Bang Theory, which was a Friends knockoff. There was also How I Met Your Mother, which copied a lot from Friends. The dominant single camera show was Modern Family, which was certainly on the ""hanging  out"" tree. And then there's Curb, where all Larry does is wander around."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Interesting that you mentioned Brooklyn 99 since it always felt like an updated version of Barney Miller to me. I think its more of a cyclical thing. The work place sitcom is not a new thing, there's been things like Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, Mash, Sports Night, News Radio, Taxi, Night Court, Murphy Brown etc there may be more of a concentration of them now. I have to admit i don't really keep up with modern comedies so i can't say for sure"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Not even entirely joking here: people have less friends today. Most of their relationships outside of family now are workplace related.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"There are broadly three types of sitcom. Family, friends and workplace. Every few years one those types gets into fashion usually pushed by a big hit."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"No I think the opposite is true.  Before Seinfeld, I can't think of any sitcom that was just friends hanging out.  As far as popular older shows like that, just that and Friends and the Friends clones like Caroline in the City, Two Guys and a Girl etc.  Pretty much every old sitcom was work or family based."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,bc all we do is work nowadays (when not busy side hustling)
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Grand Crew is a sitcom about a group of friends.  Very much Friends except none of the Friends are white and they hang out in a wine bar instead of a coffee shop.  It's really good.

Ghosts is about a group of friends, they're just mostly dead."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,This thread is you bring outed by your selective viewing choices
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,How do you count cheers?
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I don't know, but sitcoms moved from ""just hanging"" to a more aggressive approach to comedy in the mid to late '90s - Seinfeld, Frasier, Friends. Shows naturally sped up as they went along even if they only briefly touched this period -- like Cheers. Arrested Development was one of the first to truly capitalise on this by moving at a quick clip, jam-packed with self-referential stuff. I far preferred the lazier early seasons of sitcoms pre-mid/late '90s."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"""Sitcoms about friends hanging out"" died in the 2010s because any show like that other than New Girl wasn't able to rake in multiple millions of viewers consistently. Pretty much all the big 
ones that premiered after New Girl failed. So Hollywood got scared out of making them. They'll come back eventually."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"New girl is just friends hanging out. It's from 2011.

Big bang theory, how I met your father, that 90s show, fresh of the boat, derry girls."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Car 54 where are you

Gomer Pyle usmc

Andy Griffith Show is more workplace than family

Mary Tyler Moore Show

The Phil Silvers Show

and the nineties were full of them:

John Larroquette Show

Newsradio

Just Shoot Me

many others"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I'd also argue it's the exact opposite. It's so much easier to meet people now than anytime in the past. Before you had people you went to school with, people you lived next to you, friends of the family, or colleagues. You had to be close to get to know people and keep in contact. Now people can have much more diverse friend groups through hobbies, by meeting online, have long distance friendships through texting or FaceTiming. Its easier to have a lot more acquaintances and keep in casual contact through social media than a handful of constant companions. You can fade in and out of people's lives and still keep track of them without spending all that time face to face. And if you don't like them, there are always hundreds, thousands, millions more people at your digital fingertips ready to meet and socialize with... like here on reddit, discord, etc. Before people kept hanging out with crappy friends that caused conflict because getting new ones was hard, and a shared history was enough to hold the group together. Now people have more discerning standards and a workplace is a much more convenient place to have chaos through forced proximity, which suits a sitcom situation. 

So many comedies back in the day were about toxic families that stayed together..... because??? That's just what they did, even when they were miserable. That was the whole joke of the show. Nowadays that dynamic would be considered borderline emotional and verbal abuse. Same with a lot of the shows with friend groups. They're practically bullies who constantly insult and undermine each other, or act as sponges who use each other.

In a workplace you're under no obligation to like each other and can have zero in common with those around you. Dynamics that wouldn't be tolerated in most friend groups. But because the characters work together they're forced to bear it and at least act polite, hence creating the situation for comedy."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"It's got to be cyclical.  How many places have you got a group of people who are routinely together?  Work, family or friends.  And if they are friends, it's a little easier if some of them are roommates.

*Seinfeld* stands out because it's a friends show, without them being roommates."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"WKRP, Wings. Before these, the military shows were also ""workplace"" shows."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,">Barney Miller

Yeah, I think they were directly inspired from that. At least I kinda remember that from the BTS of B99 video on youtube."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"How dare you forget about the Pizza Place. That's like talking about Zoe and forgetting about Duncan, Jack and Jane"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Golden Girls

Three’s company

Laverne and Shirley

Perfect Strangers"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Cheers was seen as a workplace show, following on Taxi."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,free association doesnt make community
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I think it's like the internet. Just because you have all this access and connection at your fingertips doesn't mean everyone is getting closer together. Quite the contrary in fact.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I hadn't thought about that but it is different.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I didn't watch much of Wings, it may have played against something else. I remember watching WKRP with my dad as a kid. Both great shows."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Sure but it's also how you use the internet. Introverted, shy, or awkward people were always going to have a hard time forming relationships, and shallow self centred people would have a hard time keeping them. But I've amassed friends in dozens of countries with relationships the have lasted more than a decade because we could keep in touch online. People that I met for a week when travelling have become lifelong friends because I can keep up to date with them, see photos of their lives, chat or message them multiple times a week on social media. Before that a couple random long distance calls or post cards would have never been possible to keep up that kind of connection. Through the pandemic I made more friends than ever on random discord servers for various creators and hobbies. I saw people fall in love and move across the country to be with the partners they met there, who they spent months talking to each other daily, or sharing late night watch parties, posting pics of their meals, sharing stories of their hardship, venting about work etc. I built connections with people who shared my interests and random obsessions. People that I never would have met before. Or never could have kept in contact with had we been relying on old school telephone calls or letters. These are all friends I could message day or night and who would be there for me whenever I needed. We've had multiple meetups irl, in multiple countries. Getting together to go to events or just so we could all hang out for real. 

People who feel a lack of connection 'because of the internet' were never going to put in the work to get to know or care about other people. They would only hang around people who were convenient and in close proximity. Which is exactly what I said in my last post. The internet is full of opportunities, but not everyone wants to take advantage of them. And that's their loss."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Intro to that crazy show. I really liked it as a kid. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWjLjPqwtk8"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,remembering this show felt like a fever dream. only thing i remember with her in it specifically was maybe a song about ....boxing? something about rolling with the punches. and there being a roller blading rabbit.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I had almost forgotten about this show. The theme song just came rushing back to me. What a trip! Move over, Chip ‘n’ Dale, there’s a new ear worm in town..."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I loved this show! RIP Armelia.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Oh, I remember that show! That’s so sad.

She had quite a presence."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"If you had asked me as a kid who the most beautiful woman in the world was, she would have been a top contender. I thought she was SO glamorous. Truly amazing voice. Sad to let go of such a special part of my childhood. ❤️"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Didn't know John Oliver was in this
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Oh no! She was so freaking amazing. I have some great memories watching this show with my father every morning. She will be missed.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Damn I loved this show!!
‘When you wear
a Regal gown,
You’ll feel like....
A million dollahs!’

RIP to one of my first Queens."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I thought I remembered every show I watched as a child. Holy fuck as soon as I saw that rabbit guy it clicked.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Why did I literally put one of the shows on yesterday for my kid to watch after 20 yrs of never seeing an episode! Coincidentally this shows up on my feed the next day.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I had nightmares for YEARS because of The Were-hare.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Aww that's so sad. I loved this show as a kid. She was great.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Very sad
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Original poster: if you're going to rewrite a headline, please get the punctuation right.  Apostrophes don't make plurals:  the decades is the 1990s or the '90s for short."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"And a brief history of it by DefunctTV that is worth watching.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWpDfO5wnq4"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,This took me back to 3rd grade. My brothers and I would watch this and then run to meet the bus for school. Havent seen the opening in decades. Sensory memory overload just now
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I liked it too, and there's no way that zoobilee zoo people weren't involved with this.  Pretty sure the zoobilee fox was the caterpillar in this."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I was a kid in the late 90's who LOVED Alice in Wonderland. I found a VHS of a couple episodes of this at the local video store and watched the whole thing in a state of complete confusion and bafflement. 10/10. The early 90's are almost impossibly strange if you didn't live through them.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Welp now I feel old, I would put this show on for a couple kids I used to babysit 😑"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Drugs weren’t as creative in the 90’s.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"The one vivid thing I remember is an episode where the queen hits her funny bone and loses her sense of humor. She tells the Cheshire cat to wipe the smile off his face and he says, ""I can't wipe the smile off the face, but I can wipe the face off the smile,"" and does the Cheshire Cat disappearing trick."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Only episode I remember rovolved around Alice messing up the Queen's favorite chair and getting the mad hatter and March hare to reupholster it but they had to use some blue fabric so it was mostly red but there was this blue triangle and Alice knew she was going to get in trouble, but then it turned out the queen had been gone all day picking blueberries and she sat on the chair before looking at it and then assumed the blue spot was a stain from the blue berries."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I read this post’s title and had no idea what it was talking about. Until I did. Memories just came flooding back and yeah, it feels like something insane you imagined in childhood fantasies.,"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I remember quicksand and the intro and that it was my favorite TV show
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,There was a wheel chair kid in that one I believe
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Wait, what?"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Yeah ! that was a great episode.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,This was me too. The show started and I always had to leave about 15 minutes in to it. Really enjoyed this show in the mornings as a kid.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I loved both of these shows. And now that you say that about the fox, it does look like him"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"I'd you want that, you go to Nickelodeon in the 90s"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,https://youtu.be/qhpwt2M7T2M
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I remember that. Idk why I laugh every time lol
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,There is just a rat looking dude in it. John Oliver is not in it
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I actually thought it up and was wrong.  But there has to be makeup people or something that are shared between the two.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Oh, lol. I had to go and look. Yeah the guy does look like him."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,[deleted]
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
She-Wolves: England’s Early Queens,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
American Crime,Hanzee Dent
American Crime,Is that Zahn? Aka Mathias from longmire
American Crime,Is it actually like Twin Peaks? Trying to scratch that itch.
American Crime,"Great show based on first impressions. Great casting, direction, and cinematography, very authentic. Something refreshingly different. Good to see that part of America getting some attention."
American Crime,"Saw a commercial for this yesterday and it felt like a serious version of “Reservation Dogs”. 

Same actor that plays “Big” is the lead in Dark Winds. 

Leads off with some armored car robbery, Res Dogs had a snack truck theft. 

And obviously the modern Native American backdrop"
American Crime,Loved Tony Hillerman books as a teenager very excited to see Joe Leaphorn on screen.
American Crime,Killed it in Fargo
American Crime,Akecheta!!!
American Crime,"I'm interested but if it has that AMC cheese like Into the Badlands, Hell on Wheels, etc. I'm kind of hesitant."
American Crime,"Really enjoyed the first episode, and wish it was on a streamer so that I could binge it."
American Crime,"After two episodes it's just alright.  I have to imagine , it's very educational to outsiders like me, what life on the country's largest Native American reservation was/is like.  As entertainment it's very broad, walking the police murder mystery  path which has been well worn, and offering little in narrative or structural difference to make it exciting."
American Crime,Oooooo*italics**italics*
American Crime,This series is so slow and boring. I’m on the third episode it makes no sense whatsoever
American Crime,Gangs of London was fucking EPIC!  So many curve balls and plots twists.
American Crime,"Everyone knows you have to follow the Disney trifecta to be successful!

1.	Jokes
2.	Explosions
3.	Easter Eggs

Sucks cos good shows like this no one watches and instead watch Boba Fett/Kenobi etc"
American Crime,FUCK AMC
American Crime,[deleted]
American Crime,I guess it isn't a crime drama without a murder. I guess it's the only way to have a serious show apparently.
American Crime,Stoked for this.
American Crime,"This is based on the Lou diamond Phillips movie, right?"
American Crime,Does anyone else think this series is slow moving and hard to get into? I mean the cause of death for a girl she was scared to death and there’s a weird witch women. I guess I just dont get it. The FBI agent is goofy as well.
American Crime,Still one of my favourite characters in the series.
American Crime,"""I just wanted a glass of water."""
American Crime,"Yeah, he’s in everything now, it’s great"
American Crime,When I saw the commercial for it I instantly recognize him
American Crime,"It has some ""magic"" in it, but lacks the humor and so far isn't nearly as weird."
American Crime,"Not really, I struggle to see similarities after having watched the first two episodes."
American Crime,It's based on Native American detective novels from Tony Hillerman
American Crime,"I’m hoping it’s like Skinwalkers, which wasn’t as as avant-guard  as Twin Peaks, but had the same dream-like undertones:

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt6954520/"
American Crime,"The Killing (US version) similar to Twin Peaks, without the ""Lynchness"" 

who killed Laura Palmer/Rosie Larsen? set in Pac NW, murder of a young girl takes 2 seasons to solve"
American Crime,"Not really.  It's more comparable to something like Hap and Leonard.

There's not really much that's like Twin Peaks other than Twin Peaks."
American Crime,"You hit the nail on the head, ‘ Refreshingly different ‘. Nice to see faces that don’t look like me."
American Crime,Elva Guerra who plays Jackie in Res Dogs also has a pretty prominent role so far in Dark Winds.
American Crime,about damn time Zahn McClarnon was given a leading role
American Crime,"I started to watch without knowing it was based on Hillerman's books, and as soon as I heard ""Chee,"" I thought bingo!"
American Crime,"Wait this is Joe Leaphorn? I loved those books when I was a kid, excited for this."
American Crime,"Same, even the old tv specials on PBS were pretty decent, so I’m excited for this."
American Crime,"I'd say limit your expectations if you're approaching this as a Hillerman fan.  It's an intriguing show so far but it's nothing like his novels.

Jim Chee in particular feels way off the book version."
American Crime,"haven't seen him not kill it in anything

hope the guy gets all the starring roles going forward, he's earned it"
American Crime,All I can think about is the announcer for AMC repeating “LOW WINTER SUN” in that weird deep voice all dramatic.
American Crime,Remember when AMC was the odds-on favorite to be the next HBO? Too bad basically everything since Mad Men and Breaking Bad has been mediocre.
American Crime,Or Rubicon…
American Crime,This is based on a book series from the 1970s by tony hilleman. I’ve read the first one and it’s pretty good so that gives me hope
American Crime,Thou shalt not besmirch hell on wheels…
American Crime,I love both those shows
American Crime,"As a fan of westerns I legitimately liked hell on wheels. Not nearly on the same caliber as mad men or breaking bad, but one of if not the only good true western tv show"
American Crime,"Into the badlands was an amazing show, what do you mean ?"
American Crime,It's definitely chock-full of cheese but I'm hooked and want to see how it ends. I'll watch it weekly instead of saving it up as it's not a show that inspires binging.
American Crime,"I was about to start hell on wheels, what kind of cheese does it have?"
American Crime,For whatever reason a lot of shows that felt like they should have ended up on AMC ended up on networks like IFC and Sundance instead.
American Crime,"People can watch both, you know? Idk why comments like yours come up. 

I'd guess the real reason people wouldn't watch a show like this might be racism or indifference."
American Crime,Shut up baby dick
American Crime,Murder is an interesting crime. What depiction of crime do you prefer to watch on tv? Jay walking?
American Crime,Yeah def up there. A lot of amazing characters in that show
American Crime,He’s surely having an awesome resurgence of his career!
American Crime,His episode on Westworld was amazing
American Crime,"IN everything, about damn time they gave him his own starring role"
American Crime,I really enjoyed his small role in Bone Tomahawk. They only one smart enough to tell the main characters they were going on basically a suicide mission.
American Crime,Novels by the same name? Always looking for new reading material.
American Crime,does anything *actually* mystical/supernatural happen in the novels (not just appear that way)?
American Crime,Those two seasons were great tv
American Crime,"I can take or leave it if they don't look like me, just give us an original story & don't treat your audience like they're idiots.

most are not; they just want a smart story with interesting characters played by decent actors, given decent direction & believable words coming out of their mouths

I can't be the only one tired of remakes/sequels/prequels/reboots/reimaginings ?"
American Crime,For years the old racist whiten men in hollywood demanded that the rest of us didn’t want to see diversity because they didn’t want to see it and are afraid of it. Personally this is the type of entertainment I want to see.
American Crime,"""BuT wHo WiLl WaTcH?!""

If it's well written, everyone."
American Crime,Lol yes! Or announcing Talking Dead! Those were good times….
American Crime,Except The Terror (s1)
American Crime,Better Call Saul is legit great.
American Crime,That's true. FX on the other hand has been really consistent with their content.
American Crime,Halt And Catch Fire.
American Crime,AMC doesn't develop many shows.  Breaking bad and BCS were developed by Sony
American Crime,"Between Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and The Walking Dead, AMC definitely was much stronger than HBO from 2008-2012."
American Crime,Halt and Catch Fire would like a word
American Crime,I would rank The Terror and Halt and Catch Fire among the ten best shows I've ever seen.
American Crime,"Eh, not really the case, better call Saul is some of the best tv on currently, halt and catch fire was great, lodge 49 was surprisingly good as was dispatches from elsewhere, first season of the terror was great as others have said. Saying basically everything has been mediocre is a bit hyperbolic"
American Crime,"Rubicon came at a “bad time”, it’s right when The Walking Dead started to take off and birdied everything in its path. AMC tried to ratings chase and killed lower performing shows. I think Rubicon would have been a lot like Halt and Catch Fire where it slowly built an audience and acclaim (most who watched it liked it). Still irks me that they made it so difficult to watch after they had ended the show even when having a streaming service (it took a while for it to show up there)."
American Crime,For real. I loved that show. Cullen Bohannon is one of my favorite Western characters now. Wasn't super thrilled with where the story went the last couple of seasons but I still loved it all. Also shout out to Elam Ferguson. Poor guy.
American Crime,Seriously. Hell on Wheels was great.
American Crime,lulz
American Crime,"My point in my very unpopular throwaway comment here was I'm bored with dramatic TV having to be propped up by murder stories. Kidnapping, drug smuggling, and exploitation are other big crimes that could be made interesting. 

For example I was excited for Open Range which was still good, but I had to ask ""are we really doing this murder trope AGAIN, even in lite Sci-Fi?""."
American Crime,"I love the series overall, but damn season two was stacked. Mike Milligan was my favorite, but the first two seasons especially were phenomenal."
American Crime,Agreed. He nailed it
American Crime,It was fricking saddd
American Crime,Yep!
American Crime,"I dont remember. It was over 20 years ago when I first read some of his stuff. Honestly, this show makes me want to pick up the books and read him again. 

They're not long reads. A day or two at most."
American Crime,"oh, we totally watched all 4 seasons. because Joel Kinnaman & Mireille Enos were both phenomenal"
American Crime,"I like a remake/reimagining when a previous incarnation left things on the table. As long as they don't rehash the old stuff. 

That's why, imho, Batman etc can be an infinite well. Just stop showing his parents murdered in slomo. 

Bond, Dr Who, Jack Ryan...all these properties and more can still be fresh and vibrant as long as you aren't just treating them as an atm. Not that there isn't infinite new content to bring to the screen, but there's room for both."
American Crime,"I read all the screenwriters were Native American. This troubles me as we need more diversity in the script room. As well as the actors. Why aren’t they giving fresh Chinese, Mongolian, Zimbabwean, Chilean people a voice and opportunity?"
American Crime,"it has Zahn McClarnon, so I will watch

if it's well-written, I will keep watching"
American Crime,Season 2 was such a let down
American Crime,Would have been so much better without the whole >!supernatural polar bear bullshit!<
American Crime,It’s amazing but that’s why I said basically and not definitively.
American Crime,yea season 3-4 were great!
American Crime,"Yep, this was as good or better than Mad Men"
American Crime,HACF is a masterpiece.
American Crime,Is there anywhere I can watch The Terror? Does AMC have its own streaming channel?
American Crime,Does The Terror end on a cliffhanger?
American Crime,"Yea Better Call Saul is the big exception, and the reason why I said ""basically.""

I hear good things about Halt & Catch Fire and The Terror, but even still, 3 for the few dozen they've had in the last 15 years is a straight up bad batting average, especially for a network that was trying to compete with the top tier of premium cable."
American Crime,So you want to murder murder?
American Crime,"Any recommendations for what you're asking for? A serious drama buolt around something other than a murder?

Dead serious, because I'm having trouble coming up with examples myself."
American Crime,"Season 4 brings it back. S3 is mired by Hawley and co being stretched too thin, and you can see it with S2 of legion being that shows indisputable weakest point as well

That being said, there’s still good and interesting stuff in any Hawley shows."
Republic of Doyle,"When I lived in Buffalo, NY, it used to play on local TV, and I liked it. a lot. Buffalo is very close to Canada so we got Canadian TV. The main detective was really likable and I liked his whole family getting involved in his cases. Plus Newfoundland is a really pretty setting."
Republic of Doyle,Love it. It reminds me of the Rockford Files. Great cast. Great scenery.
Republic of Doyle,Loved this show. Binged it and was sad when it ended.
Republic of Doyle,Just started binging it. It's got me sucked in!
Republic of Doyle,nice show.i watching right now on Netflix.
Republic of Doyle,"I really, really, really wanted to like Republic of Doyle, but the male lead Allan Howco is absolutely horrible to the point I decided to give up on it after the first season (on IMDB TV).  The supporting cast is pretty decent, having liked the Malachy and Des.

The female characters are fairly decently written and performed, EXCEPT for their relationship with Jake where's he this charismatic and charming and smart man that they can't live without when he is the exact opposite.

At least Nikki is written out of the show (after season 1) after obsessing over Jake during Season 1 and refusing to give him a divorce.  I feel bad for Leslie and the scene where she confronted him at the Doyle house and said something like ""What are you doing to me? I can't get you out of my mind."" right before they had sex was absolute cringe."
Republic of Doyle,"Crazy that you can do a write up about that era and not mention the term Blue Sky. 

Listen, I agree with you 1000%, I think binging and streaming has ripped away so much of what makes the TV viewing experience great. But that's the reality and that's why these channels has to move away from certain types of broadcasting. I hope streaming and binging is an over-correction and we move back towards this model soon but until then we're not likely to see much of this style for a while."
Republic of Doyle,"It’s like THE DEAD ZONE never existed to you. Wow. 

Premiered a month before Monk and lasted 6 seasons and often in the “characters welcome” motto."
Republic of Doyle,"USA's sister network Siffy also had their own successful Blue Sky shows at the time, like Eureka and Warehouse 13."
Republic of Doyle,"There was a philosophy behind the shows and success that I understood from director commentary as “Blue Sky procedural”, especially with Monk and Pysch, where USA found a sweet spot between network procedurals with graphics and explosions, and HBO procedurals with darkness and heavy storylines. Monk and Pysch found a sweet spot with light hearted blue sky backdrops (although the Vancouver skies became more and more incorporated), a not too heavy plot, driven by relationships, really cheap costs, and a small but steady fan base"
Republic of Doyle,"All I remember about In Plain Sight was that they really played up the horny level with Mary McCormack, I feel like every ad included her in the process of having sex with someone 

The 2000’s usa era was a whole vibe but it was mainly built around them re-airing Law and Order SVU and House episodes"
Republic of Doyle,"I don't get how nbc can't seem to make good sitcoms anymore   
Cheers.   
Frasier.   
Friends.   
Seinfeld.   
30 rock.   
The Office.   
Golden Girls.   
Will and Grace.   
Scrubs.   
Community.   
My Name is Earl.   
More than half them are at the top of the all time best lists (MASH would be the only big one it's missing) the rest hold solid cult status."
Republic of Doyle,Sarah Shahi had a great vehicle in Person Of Interest.
Republic of Doyle,"You’re mainly overlooking tastes change over time.  I love the fun procedural format but less people want to watch that now.  You mention TNT, they moved away from that format too like USA.  The librarians wasn’t much of a success ratings wise and that was the last one"
Republic of Doyle,"TNT had at least one (though technically 2) long running crime of the week show with “The Closer/Major Crimes”.

Though they haven’t had a lot of success with other original shows - they got it right with that one."
Republic of Doyle,No love for Dead Zone?
Republic of Doyle,Republic of Doyle is a great show.
Republic of Doyle,"They moved away from the format because the ratings steadily dipped and then cratered as the landscape rapidly became more fragmented. There’s still no shortage of average shows with interchangeable stock characters and pleasantly bland leads, they are just more options to watch and stream them."
Republic of Doyle,"I really don't blame streaming for moving away from the Blue Sky type shows (or just plain old episodic shows. Like the X-Files, or TNG, etc...) . Their were shows like BSG that got high praise and everyone wanted to recreate it, but on their own terms."
Republic of Doyle,[deleted]
Republic of Doyle,"I don't feel the need to use any terminology. I'm not here to make a participant feel like they need to know something from the outset.

The streaming model is clearly not working and has not left much of an impact outside of one or two inconsistent shows, and those shows release so infrequently (or had subsequent releases that failed to make an impact) that even that is difficult to argue. The main shows I think of are Stranger Things and 13 Reasons Why. I would put Orange is the New Black in there as it fulfills basically every requirement, it's at 91 episodes and it was quite popular - but did it make an impact? Do people still talk about it? Is it even something people want to rewatch like The Wire? I think you're seeing the limitations clearly with OitNB - it's not rewatchable. It doesn't capture your audience's attention after it goes off the air. 

Just because it's happening doesn't mean it's a good decision. We're seeing Hollywood at its most creatively bankrupt. Every company is chasing a trend instead of setting out on its own. We're getting a Wednesday Adams show now to create an ""Addams Family Universe"" of shows. A great idea individually, but a template following idea that will need to show immediate success to even be considered to continue. 

I do not think it is sustainable for TV. There's a lack of sitcoms hitting syndication as well, which I am very curious how it will be handled. I am hopeful that CBS will renew United States of Al and B Positive though. There's been a number of sitcoms that have been cut down too early, and there's a vacuum that will need to be filled. The current Television trends just aren't sustainable for the long term market TV has created.

Speaking of USA - does anyone even talk about Mr. Robot anymore? Its only real success story for the entire 2010s and..."
Republic of Doyle,Those pesky Dead Zone fanatics got me again!
Republic of Doyle,"The Dead Zone, that's a 00's deep cut. great show"
Republic of Doyle,It WAS the characters welcome motto they used a lot lmao and then they started using House and stuff
Republic of Doyle,Man did that show really stretch out their main plot.  I enjoyed the crime of the week episodes but they had a solid Stillson plot and would advance in the smallest of increments each season.  Then the show ran out of clock and it went unresolved.
Republic of Doyle,"I loved the crossover commercial with Anthony Michael Hall? James Rhoday, and Tony Shalloub"
Republic of Doyle,Blue sky shows were amazing then and especially now. At the height of the pandemic they were so comforting to watch.
Republic of Doyle,Characters Welcome.
Republic of Doyle,"That's why it's on the Lesser Tier. 

Covert Affairs had Coyote Ugly's Piper Perabo so the hornyness level was much higher. Every ad had her mouth in minor O face. But honestly I just think that's her resting face."
Republic of Doyle,"The Office and 30 Rock broke NBC sitcoms. Both shows had amazing talent (30 Rock taking some of the best SNL writers of the era and The Office having great writers and Steve Carrell's abilities) and made the handheld camera look or lack of studio audience. Michael Schur's other projects had good success (Parks and Rec, The Good Place), but P & R definitely excelled off the talking head format from The Office. Both 30 Rock and Office ended in 2013 and since then there have been virtually no shows to mirror their success. 

I think the main issue is that streaming, especially streaming of The Office on Netflix, changed the whole game. NBC is now trying to create that scenario again. A show that you can flip on and binge that *feels* like The Office, but unfortunately isn't. 

The list of short lived NBC sitcoms over the past 10 years is long and sad."
Republic of Doyle,"NBC farms out The Office's concept for almost all of its new comedies. Parks & Recs, Superstore, American Auto, Grand Crew. Is Mr. Mayor like it? I don't really watch any of them, but it's clear their workplace single camera comedy style is hereditary.

Given the vast popularity, both in terms of reruns, in terms of cultural impact, and in terms of longevity, that a multi-cam audience sitcom show has, you'd think NBC would try more than 1 a year, if they even get to that 1. Was their last attempt Undateable? They went to an all-live episode format and then canned the show. But it's not like NBC understands the appeal of live programming given how much of SNL is pre-recorded nowadays.

Also, side note, My Name is Earl will never get the appreciation it deserves."
Republic of Doyle,Community doesn’t belong on that list with those other titles
Republic of Doyle,"To really be a vehicle show for someone, it needs to be a show made to show them off. Sarah Shahi didn't come in to Person of Interest until Taraji P. Henson had to leave because she got too big for the show (going on to star in another vehicle for her, Empire). You could argue much stronger that Person of Interest was a vehicle for her.

The other example is when a show is retooled around a new character. Take Ziva on NCIS. She comes in for Season 3 and the show revolves around her until she leaves (because... the show is not revolving around her enough?).

While she is great on Person of Interest, as she is in everything, it wasn't a vehicle for her like it was for the three main leads. And by the time she came on, the show had other recurring characters it was focusing, and while her character did get some focus, I can't consider near enough for it to be a Vehicle for her. Not when there's so much else going on and other main characters. It was a very big show for Michael Emerson. He is just chilling on Evil."
Republic of Doyle,"I don't think tastes change over time. I think TV executives are chasing Prestige TV trends. Given the shows that find success in reruns on streaming, I think the fun procedural format would have immense success. And the shows I mentioned in that format made after USA stopped trying - Republic of Doyle, Private Eyes, Almost Paradise, Magnum PI, etc - they're all very good shows. And given the ratings Magnum PI gets (averaging from 7.5 to 9 million viewers), it seems the format can still find immense success. But if no one is making them, we won't find out."
Republic of Doyle,"Yes those were big hits for TNT. I was always confused why TNT didn't try to capitalize on that genre fanbase more. Or, like, pick a genre and work towards it. Remember their show Monday Mornings? I don't know who that was aimed at. Wiki says it was paired with Dallas - that is an insane pairing!! CW put Riverdale with Dynasty. That is a natural pairing."
Republic of Doyle,"Leverage is the first ""blue skies"" like show I remember from TNT."
Republic of Doyle,I'm sorry!!!
Republic of Doyle,"It's terrific!!

Allan Hawco has not had such a rewatchable show since. I would have loved to see it still on the air alongside Murdoch Mysteries.   


Still waiting on Allan Hawco to be the Alan Wake as well."
Republic of Doyle,"Decreased viewership definitely killed the blue skies era but I disagree that there's a lot of shows like the ones that came out in that era. The appeal of those shows were they balanced light-hearted fun, cases of the week, and overarching plots well.

If there are, I'd welcome a list."
Republic of Doyle,I do not agree with anything you've written.
Republic of Doyle,"No, it's that they're all light and breezy."
Republic of Doyle,I agree with most of your points but I do have to add that Mr Robot is not widely dicussed because it was critically praised but due to the subject matter and they way in which they told the story it became a very niche show but it still is a show that had a amazing run/
Republic of Doyle,"I mean, cmon. It aired at the same time, and maybe even the same night but my memory is fuzzy on that one."
Republic of Doyle,"Yeah, I remember  that. IIRC, USA wanted the show to be more “…of the week” and less serialized so a lot of that plot was dropped. The final season was very low budget with cast exists as well."
Republic of Doyle,"I missed them. Also did you hear how the cast of Eureka found out how they got cancelled? It was a shitty way, and n my opinion."
Republic of Doyle,"I don’t think Superstore or Mr. Mayor break the 4th wall, which is the defining aspect of Office/P&R"
Republic of Doyle,Cinema verite existed before the office lol
Republic of Doyle,Did you watch Life with her and Damian Lewis?
Republic of Doyle,"> To really be a vehicle show for someone, it needs to be a show made to show them off. Sarah Shahi didn't come in to Person of Interest until Taraji P. Henson had to leave because she got too big for the show (going on to star in another vehicle for her, Empire). You could argue much stronger that Person of Interest was a vehicle for her.

The part about Henson just simply isn't accurate. Nolan wrote her out because he wanted to shift the series away from the cops / HR plot and onto Samaritan. He has said in interviews he told Henson about her character's death in early 2013 and her last episode aired in November of 2013 (aside from the flashback episode she returned for). She wasn't cast on Empire until February of 2014. So Empire had nothing to do with her exit on POI, it was a creative decision."
Republic of Doyle,"Well agree to disagree.  Private eyes was pretty good but like some of the other shows you listed was broadcast in Canada, that’s just a different market. I watch magnum pi however and it’s something I only put on as background noise and it’s not that comedic(the CBS procedurals mostly aren’t).  Also it only does 5mil viewers now.  CBS shows all have nice overall numbers but do poorly with the 18-49 demo which is what advertisers care about, mostly old people watch their shows.  Magnum pi does a .4 this season in the demo and can’t even beat smackdown.  https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/friday-tv-ratings-charmed-blue-bloods-the-blacklist-shark-tank-friday-night-smackdown/

I’m a huge fan of the comedy procedural genre so tried a lot of the recent new ones and they mostly don’t get ratings and this is network tv too where they’re not looking for prestige dramas.  Stuff like whiskey cavalier, limitless(such a good show), take two(basically castle 2.0), Lucifer etc.  there’s a reason there’s not 1 comedy procedural on network tv now.  

Kind of have to accept it was a combination of era and well written and cast tv with some luck too that lead to the USA era.  A lot of those creators have tried making new shows in a similar style but it’s just hard making a successful show."
Republic of Doyle,"Well you can look for yourself. Covert Affairs would have done under a million viewers an episode if it got renewed for a fifth season., that’s the trajectory it was on."
Republic of Doyle,"I'm not denying it its amazing run, I'm only saying that it's not a show you can build your network on. They've tried to recreate its success and failed. It's something you mix in to a varied network, and the critical praise draws eyes to other shows. 

TV needs shows like Mr. Robot. But one successful show in this new format does not a network make."
Republic of Doyle,"No, how did they hear?"
Republic of Doyle,"interesting thought, is it really ""breaking the 4th wall"" if the characters know they're being filmed documentary style?"
Republic of Doyle,Mr Mayor is more like a 30-rock
Republic of Doyle,Superstore was created by an Office writer tho
Republic of Doyle,"I think ""Breaking the 4th Wall"" has been hereditarily breeded out from the concept as it becomes difficult over time to explain why there is a camera guy filming these people in different settings. Parks & Recs began to struggle with it as quickly as its format change in the third season.

I believe the defining aspect is the single camera, toned down, workplace comedy setting. (Even though all anyone wants is a Dr. Johnny Fever.)"
Republic of Doyle,What? When did I say that it didn't? Why is this the reply to me when I just said I don't think the documentary aspect is even the defining feature of The Office?
Republic of Doyle,Doesn't ring a bell but what a cast it must have been starring those two!
Republic of Doyle,"Thank you for correcting me. It's been a while since this event. I do remember lots of anger.

(But the show was still a vehicle for her.)"
Republic of Doyle,But Whiskey Cavalier was a fun premise but a bad show. It is hard making a successful show. But just because there's failures in a certain show type doesn't mean that genre is a failure. There's numerous failures in every type of show repeatedly. I think America wants more of these types of shows than are currently being made. That's my point.
Republic of Doyle,"I am utterly baffled how your first comment has anything to do with this second comment. Covert Affairs was not even a show I praised. Covert Affairs projecting to do under a million viewers an episode for a fifth season has nothing to do with anything. And given the trends in television, that would be one of the top shows on cable today if it was hitting under a million an episode. 

But yeah, I don't have a Covert Affairs argument, so I don't know what you are saying. And I will certainly not take an argument that you cancel your successful show genre because of a fracturing landscape. I don't understand how you can say ""the ratings are going down because of an industry wide expansion which saw every show decrease in ratings flatly"" as evidence a show should be cancelled. But I don't know what you are trying to say."
Republic of Doyle,"Long story short, they were at first renewed for a short Season 6 and then NBC reverse that descion and cancelled the series without telling them. The the cast didn't find out until they read their Twitter feed. Where the fans were upset that they were cancelled."
Republic of Doyle,Good call
Republic of Doyle,"tbf, workplace comedy goes back pretty damn long.  It's just that the multi-camera 'filmed in front of an audience' feel got extremely dated feeling.  CBS kept with with it though.  Scrubs and Arrested Development were the starting gun for the change (I'd love to include Andy Richter Controls the Universe but not many people watched it)."
Republic of Doyle,"I second the recommendation of Life.  It started in 2007 and unfortunately the first season was interrupted by the writers' strike.  It did get another season and the last episode was written as a series finale, and that's pretty remarkable considering how many series at the time were cancelled and ended on cliffhangers.

My one gripe is that the episodes available on streaming services don't include the original music choices and instead substitute cheaper, filler music.  Still, the series is well worth watching."
Republic of Doyle,"Yea I would say the fact that it’s hard finding one of those types of shows take off on network tv is evidence not necessarily that the genre is a failure but it’s less popular now and may not be what people want.  Different generations may different things.  Whiskey may have been mediocre(though I liked it) but what about the others I listed.  Limitless got praise even on Reddit and Lucifer got a lot more love when it leaned into the supernatural aspect for the Netflix seasons.

Like it may not be our favorite type of show but I feel like HBO and other successes is decent evidence people want more prestige dramas"
Republic of Doyle,You’re taking this way too seriously while also not understanding conversation lol
Republic of Doyle,You called Covert affairs a “lesser but still successful” show. It got cancelled because it wasn’t successful anymore. You seem befuddled that USA gave up on the formula. I’m trying to tell you they gave up the formula because it stopped working.
Republic of Doyle,Woooooow
Republic of Doyle,"I don't think people want Prestige Dramas, I think that's just the only thing that is being created. Did anyone know they wanted Peacemaker before it came out? Did anyone even think to watch Doom Patrol? 

It's all about marketing. I just think TV is marketing the wrong shows. For every successful Prestige Drama, there's tons more failures out there. 

I don't think viewers affect what gets cancelled and what gets renewed. The Baby Sitters Club was just canned and it met all the metrics needed to be renewed."
Republic of Doyle,You aren't even the same person how can you tell me I'm not understanding the conversation?
Republic of Doyle,"Do we measure a show's success by if it was cancelled or not? What kind of logic is this?

You can't say the formula stopped working with Covert Affairs as your example. You can clearly see a shift in USA's strategy, and they took an existing airing successful show in the same vein as Monk in Suits and retooled it. If Suits was left unchanged, I am sure it would have continued on as a successful show. So how can you argue it was a format change because of a lack of success? And given how unsuccessful USA has been since making this change, how can you argue they make any decisions based on success? Because we've had a decade of unsuccessful shows from them."
Republic of Doyle,"Well yes other factors go into a shows cancellation but ratings is one large factor.  No people didn’t specifically want peacemaker or doom patrol but they were open to superhero content for sure and ofc it was well made too which meant audiences would stick with it.   

Also I would ask have you seen Reddit granted it’s a small portion of people, people want prestige dramas here at least lol.  Also they are far from the only thing being created, as I said in last comment network tv doesn’t have them basically.  Finally, the same applies for comedy procedural.  For every monk or bones or psych, there are a bunch of failures.  Most tv shows fail.

I don’t think you can just blame marketing, the big 4 networks are decent with advertising all their shows to some extent and have tried some comedy procedurals.  Ik because I tried most of them lol"
Republic of Doyle,"Buddy, we're not talking about prestige tv here. Yes, the measure of whether Covert Affairs is successful or not is if it gets enough people to tune in and watch. You're living in 2006 and acting like everything they did was pulling in Monk numbers. They had a lot of success with Monk and White Collar and Psych and Suits, but those shows aged and got too expensive to continue on with and the replacement shows like Covert Affairs and Necessary Roughness and Common Law didn't capture the public's attention. It's not easy to keep a formula going and god knows USA tried, but it just stopped working because Monks and Psychs don't fall off trees."
Republic of Doyle,I don't think it's nearly enough comedy procedurals or comedies in general. The Comedy film has disappeared from Hollywood as well over the past decade. The world needs laughter.
Republic of Doyle,"Considering Suits was the last show in the format, and White Collar was relatively late, and Burn Notice is between Psych and White Collar, I'd say it was a very successful run of ideas. 

So what do you do with that? You keep making more shows. My entire point is they did not continue to make more shows. And your reasoning is - it's not easy to keep going? It's not easy to make shows? What the heck kind of logic is that? And what ""captured the public's attention"" after it? So you have two shows that did okay but not great so you scrap a working formula?

Maybe you are in charge of USA, because your ideas are absolutely awful and have been a proven failure."
Republic of Doyle,Well 3/4 of the networks still have a good portion of schedule for sitcoms.  Also you have comedies on hbo and fx
Republic of Doyle,"No one disputes that it was successful for a good stretch of time.

""So what do you do with that? You keep making more shows.""

They did. Covert Affairs, Fairly Legal, Necessary Roughness, Common Law, Rush and Graceland were set up to be the next generation of shows to take over the Characters Welcome mantle and all of them ended up crashing because the public was getting tired of the formula. So they went in the new direction. And it's obviously less successful than the heyday, but the heyday couldn't happen again because it's a different world. The problem with formulas is there are diminishing returns the longer you use them and USA ran headfirst into that problem."
Republic of Doyle,"I don't consider a show like Atlanta a ""comedy"". Most comedies today are ""Dramadies"", which are dramas."
Republic of Doyle,"I don't agree. Given there are still successful shows in that formula, I can't accept the idea that no one wants to watch these shows. I also believe the issue is not that the formula stopped working but that USA tried to become edgier in 2012. Their unsuccessful shows begin in 2012 as does the Suits retool. Fairly Legal is from 2011 and lands on the cusp. Necessary Roughness not a show that was going to have much comedy in it from its outset and was appealing to a more dramatic market. Rush is from 2014, outside the era, and it clearly shows in its concept. Plus 2014 is when they began advertising for their big powerhouse show DIG, which fizzled fast. It's clear USA began trying to make a new formula as early as 2012, and in doing so these new shows ended up being a bust, and in response USA went harder at the new formula and resulted in a decade with nothing to show for it but more time for NCIS (which, coincidentally, means it had a lot more of the lesser NCIS seasons to air, reductions all around.)

In summary, I can't use shows like Fairly Legal or Necessary Roughness or Common Law (another show with more edge to it than comedy) to show that the idea wasn't working. But I can use them to show USA already changed their formula, and it's been clear from the start that formula wasn't working."
Republic of Doyle,I would say some are definitely comedies.  Something like you’re the worst was a dramedy.  IASIP or Veep were not
Republic of Doyle,[removed]
Republic of Doyle,"But IASIP is not a dramady lol, it's a comedy. It's also from 2005. It's older than Psych!!"
Republic of Doyle,"I believe we should judge a television show based on the content of the show and not based on what the current ad campaign was. 

It's clear USA was changing their format up."
Republic of Doyle,I think I'm most excited for Legend of Korra. The prospect of another 3 seasons makes me very curious where they'll take this whole spirit world aspect.
Republic of Doyle,You missed New Girl; starts on 17th Sept
Republic of Doyle,Anyone know when the new season of Community starts?
Republic of Doyle,"According to the [South Park Twitter page](https://twitter.com/SouthPark), the new season of South Park is set to begin on Sept. 25. Just a heads-up."
Republic of Doyle,Does anyone know the day when the 8th season of How I Met Your Mother comes to netflix? I want to watch it before the next season starts.
Republic of Doyle,Castle!! Aww yiss.
Republic of Doyle,Anybody know when grimm starts please.
Republic of Doyle,Sherlock needs to hurry up and come back. I'm going through withdrawals. 
Republic of Doyle,I had no idea they were remaking the tomorrow people. Too bad it's on the CW and features attractive adults playing teenagers.

Republic of Doyle,Is Downton Abbey for U.S.?!

There has been another mürder."
Doctor Foster,"I look forward to De Øffice, Døktør Føstër and Løøthër. Majestik."
Doctor Foster,Tak!
Doctor Foster,I know we are talking about the cynical British original version but how you would change The US Office into Scandinavia?
Doctor Foster,">  The latest country to add the thriller detective and the comedy series to their roster of original programming is Scandinavia. This happened after **BBC Studios Nordics made a deal with Take Two Studios and STV Productions.** According to the Head of BBC Studios Nordics, Jan Salling, the production of original dramas is growing in the Nordic market and there’s no time like the present to adapt some fan-favorite shows to local audiences.


> **STV is set to co-produce 'The Office'. The mockumentary comedy series originally aired on BBC Two and was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant**. It was critically acclaimed, but the American version really took the format to the next level, extending it to a nine-season juggernaut comedy series that aired on NBC and made the careers of people like Steve Carell and John Krasinski. **The show has since been adapted to several countries, including Chile, France, Israel, and India.** 

>  Meanwhile, **Take Two Studios is responsible for bringing the Scandinavian version of 'Luther' to life**. The series follows a highly intelligent and intuitive detective that was originally played by Idris Elba. **It was also sold to several countries, including Russia, South Korea, and France. An Indian adaptation is currently underway.**


> Take Two will also adapt **'Doctor Foster', the hit British TV series that also spawned versions in Russia, India, and France, with a Philippines adaptation underway. The South Korean version of the show made history after it became the highest-rated drama in cable TV in the History of the country.**


Had no idea there were that many foreign remakes of 'The Office' and 'Luther'."
Doctor Foster,Sweded
Doctor Foster,In Finland we had our The Office version too and it was fucking horrible. Surprisingly.
Doctor Foster,I suppose the Scandinavian version will have a cuckold scene with Sven.
Doctor Foster,"I don't know about the others, but The Office is timeless and universal."
Doctor Foster,why would they adapt them? Just use the original
Doctor Foster,"Please, please don't make a Scandinavian The Office - the American one was bad enough."
Doctor Foster,The Office in Scandinavia would be a hoot. Dwight would be even Dwightier.
Doctor Foster,"Have you seen the Japanese office skit on snl

Steve Carell crushes absolutely every roll they give to him, even the joke ones


I hear the only actor they could secure was the guy who played creed, oddly enough he was already hanging out in the area for some unknown reason"
Doctor Foster,They might actually be good now then
Doctor Foster,I already knöw. The victim….was my son.
Doctor Foster,Wötcha
Doctor Foster,Did they give us all the clues?
Doctor Foster,"I know youre joking but no scandinavian language uses ë, that looks rather albanian to me"
Doctor Foster,Tack*
Doctor Foster,"The Office is probably one of the most easily adaptable shows there is, as a lot of countries have similar office cultures. The Scandinavian version can simply do what the US version did and take the template of the original UK version and then do its own spin on things."
Doctor Foster,"""The latest **country** to add the thriller detective and the comedy series to their roster of original programming is **Scandinavia**""

Who the fuck wrote this article lmao"
Doctor Foster,"That’s worth a Google right there

Edit: Kontorri. Thanks internet stranger"
Doctor Foster,They already made a Scandinavian Office: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2263665/
Doctor Foster,We were not close.
Doctor Foster,I was basing it off Monty Python mostly.
Doctor Foster,I guess same people that think Africa is a country!
Doctor Foster,Sweden doesn't count.
Doctor Foster,I loved that show! I didn't know they were making a second season. Is the second season on Netflix or will we have to wait? 
Doctor Foster,"This show is incredible.  Every single episode of the first season left me so tense... more than any other show I've seen in a while.  The acting is incredible from the entire cast.  Suranne Jones is fantastic and the actor that plays her husband is brilliant.  I swear there were so many times where I caught myself yelling at the television, saying ""What are you doing?!?!""  The whole first season is a wonderful lead up to an incredible finale.  I honestly thought this was going to be a one-off miniseries, so when I heard they were doing a second season, I couldn't imagine it being any better, but it hasn't disappointed in the least.  The second season, like you said, just started a couple weeks ago, and the show is still as brilliant, and as much, if not more, tense.  The character development is great, and I highly recommend people give this a watch.  It would be an excellent binge."
Doctor Foster,"I'm so sad we don't get the second season as it airs in the US. I'm sure I could find it by some means online but... I'll just wait for it to appear on Netflix. I loveeeeed the first season so much. Like everyone has said, every episode was edge of your seat watching. Didn't think they could do that with such a basic plot but they did. They so did. "
Doctor Foster,This is weird and funny. I just started watching the show today and it's been good so far 2 episodes in. 
Doctor Foster,I found this show when I was in Australia last November when I randomly saw the first episode  and I had to binge it. I guess I'll use my vpn to try and watch online once there's more than one episode available.
Doctor Foster,"Hello, I love Doctor Foster and I just published an interview with the two Exec Producers of the show, Jude and Roanna (see below). They have a very cool story and an amazing partnership. So happy they just won two more NTAs including Best Drama Series. 

If you want to know more about their story: https://www.meetthecreatress.com/blog/2018/1/22/roanna-benn-and-jude-liknaitzky

Tell me what you think! "
Doctor Foster,"Season 1 was fantastic,  season 2 so far seems a bit more far fetched.  without going into spoiler terrortiy the second episode has went into fantasy terrortiy "
Doctor Foster,"I'm from the UK so it's just been showing on BBC, I'm not entirely sure about anywhere else"
Doctor Foster,"Incredible show. So glad someone has mentioned this show. It is maybe the only tv series TO DATE that perhaps gets the ""psychology of men"" /affairs right/how MANY (not all, but most men) men are.  
Season 2 is every bit as incredible as the first. 
"
Doctor Foster,I've been so tense watching it haha I was so worried that it didn't need a second season and it wasn't going to be as good but so far it's been just as amazing! 
Doctor Foster,How can I watch the second season from America?
Doctor Foster,"I think that's what shocked me the most, affairs are used as minor plots in so many shows I wasn't sure how it was going to last for a full show based solely around that but it definitely pulled it off! 

You're probably better waiting for it to come on Netflix, I binged the first season so I don't know how I'm going to cope with one episode a week lol. "
Doctor Foster,Two episodes have been on and a third on Tuesday. 
Doctor Foster,"Plus the psychology of what the affair does to the person being cheated on, especially if they don't know for certain.  That person can act and do things that would otherwise seem insane."
Doctor Foster,"The transformation of [spoiler](#s ""the husband from the beginning of the first season to now, is just incredible. I had just finished watching Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norell, and Bertie Carvel couldn't have played two more different characters.  I absolutely loathe his character on Doctor Foster, and that's a sign of a great actor!"")"
Doctor Foster,"Not yet... they've only aired two episodes so far in the UK and I believe there are only five total, so i'm guessing they'll probably release the second season on Netflix shortly after."
Doctor Foster,I'm coping with one a week.  All I can think about is the finale next week.  Can't remember a tv series that gripped me so fiercely.
Doctor Foster,you could also add the psychology of the cheater and what they're going through. Simon was FANTASTIC showing the other side. He was equally as compelling as the wife.
Doctor Foster,Indeed!!! 
Doctor Foster,Oh okay great. What channel is it on in the UK?
Doctor Foster,BBC One
Doctor Foster,You'll find it on the bbc iPlayer. 
Doctor Foster,Is that an app I could get on the fire stick? I'd check but I'm at work haha
Doctor Foster,Yarp.  Try not to let work get in way of Redditing. :)
Doctor Foster,"I enjoyed this show very much and agree about the finale. But the best thing was is that it turned me on to Suranne Jones and the show ""Scott & Bailey,"" which I highly recommend if you haven't seen it yet."
Doctor Foster,"I never got around to watching this show but it was a big thing in Britain when it aired, just as Broadchurch was. 

Suranne Jones is great. She used to be a soap actress but left and moved onto better things. She's also great in the episode of Doctor Who where she plays the TARDIS (The Doctor's Wife I think it was called - written by Neil Gaiman). I also saw her portray Orlando on stage and she was amazing!"
Doctor Foster,If you say so. I did about three episodes and dumped it. I found it to be on par with Days of Our Lives or any other day time soap.
Doctor Foster,"I binged this all of today. Wow. The last episode is so suspenseful and dramatic. I don't understand how Simon doesn't (and probably won't ever) get his comeuppance... He deserves to die in a grease fire.

I wonder if she will ever get the relationship she wants with Tom, all though it does seem like she's trying a little harder. Tom seeing her in action in the very last scene will hopefully make him understand why she works so hard a little better."
Doctor Foster,"Any sex scenes or nudity?

Sounds interesting though, will watch it."
Doctor Foster,"Hmm, no, I haven't heard about that. I'll have to try watching it, thanks. If Suranne is half as convincing as Dr. Foster in it, it should still be interesting. "
Doctor Foster,"Yes, quite a bit. But it's very sparsely inserted, almost tame compared to other modern dramas. And I feel like they never 'abused' those scenes, like so many other shows do. "
Doctor Foster,Will you watch it even if there is no nudity?
Doctor Foster,"Yeah, I actually might not watch it if it has a lot of nudity/sex scenes."
Doctor Foster,"Sounds like the Doctor... is *out*.

But seriously, no idea, I'm in the UK. They do just drop shows without notice though, sometimes I'll pick up an announcement online but never see those kimd of notifications on Netflix itself."
Doctor Foster,Follow r/NetflixCanada as information is often posted on what shows are being removed.
Doctor Foster,"If you like Killing Eve, check out Fleabag. Phoebe Waller-Bridge wrote for season one of KE and this Amazon series features her as the central character of her own thing. I believe she did this as a play originally. It's pretty fun."
Doctor Foster,"Words alone won’t do her justice. I’d like to see her as the Doctor one day, but I expect she’ll get too high-profile for that real soon."
Doctor Foster,"Love her. Besides her aforementioned other shows, she was also quite good in Remember Me. I hope she becomes a mega star."
Doctor Foster,"She's never going to find another role as good as Villanelle, so she should enjoy it while it lasts."
Doctor Foster,Check out the bbc three drama Thirteen she puts in an amazing performance.
Doctor Foster,Best part of the show.
Doctor Foster,She’s also good in My Mad Fat Diary
Doctor Foster,Comer and Anya Taylor Joy should play siblings in something. Both of them have that fish eye look.
Doctor Foster,Definitely deserves more recognition.
Doctor Foster,"She plays an absolutely wonderful character in KE.  You should check out Barry as it has a ""bad guy"" who is like the male version of Villanelle.  Somehow completely without morals yet hilarious.  The character is ""NoHo"" Hank (for North Hollywood)."
Doctor Foster,She is a real... \*puts on sunglasses\* up and comer. YYYEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
Doctor Foster,[She is good in this short aswell. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwNTzQLiLYY)
Doctor Foster,She’s so good! Give her the awards now!
Doctor Foster,Can anyone explain why everyone wants to shag Eve on this show?
Doctor Foster,its too bad that the decisions Eve makes in the second season dont make any sense.
Doctor Foster,"> It's pretty fun.

So's [Crashing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5295524/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)"
Doctor Foster,"Comer's giving the performance of her career on Killing Eve and is getting a lot of attention for it, and Villanelle is probably a more challenging and more show-y role than the Doctor is. Anyway, Chris Chibnall seems unable to deliver material worth Jodie Whittaker's acting ability, so Comer's talents would probably be wasted just as badly."
Doctor Foster,"I just hope she stays in the UK for a few more years doing exceptional work, before swanning off to Hollywood to be yet another superhero."
Doctor Foster,Do you mean because Villanelle is such a great character?
Doctor Foster,"That was always my fear for Tatiana Maslany when Orphan Black ended.  She'll be great in anything she does, but that show and that role (okay, roles) was special on a level she'll probably never get to do again."
Doctor Foster,"I agree Villanelle is one of the most unique and funniest characters I have ever seen, but I still believe there are many other very different and complicated characters waiting for Comer. She has very wide range, she also can play the role very different from Villanelle."
Doctor Foster,"I agree Villanelle is one of the most unique and funniest characters I have ever seen, but I still believe there are many other very different and complicated characters waiting for Comer. She has very wide range, she also can play the role very different from Villanelle."
Doctor Foster,"Thank you.  
Not noticed that before."
Doctor Foster,I didn't realize it was the same actress when I first watched Killing Eve
Doctor Foster,"Personally I hated the miniseries but jodie made it watchable she was so great especially that last episode. She also made doctor foster watchable too, the first show where I sympathized with the husband's mistress and hated the wife"
Doctor Foster,Thank you
Doctor Foster,"Maybe in an indie horror movies which is usually Taylor Joy's specialty, comer would definitely have second billing after taylor joy though. Jodie can play the prepossessed sister lol"
Doctor Foster,"Barry is great, NoHo Hank is great, but he is nothing like Villanelle."
Doctor Foster,He's a super nice guy.
Doctor Foster,"> You should check out Barry

Yeah - I'm gonna watch that soon, thx."
Doctor Foster,Killing Eve/ Barry Crossover.
Doctor Foster,She always has that ‘deer in the headlights’ look which I find strange.
Doctor Foster,"People don't have to be super physically attractive to be attractive, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here. Eve is a complete mess, and not attractive at all, regardless of what she looks like. They never took the time to show us how she is a good character we should care about before they started making her go crazy."
Doctor Foster,I think it's a reversal of the Bond trope where every hot woman he meets wants to fuck him.
Doctor Foster,Total mystery to me...
Doctor Foster,Haven't see that yet. Have to check it out. Thanks.
Doctor Foster,"I’m not saying right now. In a few years, maybe even later. Never, if she outgrows the role, which seems highly possible. And definitely not under Chibnall. Unfortunately I’m aware the other Jodie, who’s also brilliant, has been given awful scripts and her talents have been definitely underused."
Doctor Foster,"But I want a Phoebe waller bridge Superhero played by Jodie comer :(
Well I don't know I need it but it would be fun, maybe.

Rooting for her to get the catwoman role anyhow."
Documentary Now!,I had no idea that Documentary Now! was back with a new season. That’s some welcome news!
Documentary Now!,"My dad used to watch this show, and his dad before him."
Documentary Now!,Such an amazing show.
Documentary Now!,Can we get another Blue Jean Committee episode?
Documentary Now!,I'm assuming PFT stars as Werner Herzog?
Documentary Now!,My favorite documentary is Grey Gardens so I absolutely loved their Sandy Passage episode parody. It was so well done.
Documentary Now!,I wish this show was on a streaming service somewhere
Documentary Now!,"I'm really bummed that Bill is only being an EP and not appearing this season. I know why, but he's amazing in Doc Now."
Documentary Now!,These two episodes were amazing. Skarsgård's version of Werner Herzog is spot on. Hilarious.
Documentary Now!,"Werner is the fucking man. He once ate a slow cooked leather shoe in front of an audience because he lost a bet his friend and director Errol Morris. The bet was whether or not Errol Morris could get Thin Blue Line made, which in itself is epic film. The documentary essentially proves gets a man off death row who was incorrectly convicted of murder.

Documentary Now!,I look into ze eyes of da bear
Documentary Now!,You call a man who is afraid a “chicken”. But what do you call a man who is afraid of chickens🐓? 🤔
Documentary Now!,I got married in Iceland last year and made sure to go to Arborg so I could see where they have the annual Al Capone Festival.
Documentary Now!,The Blue Jean Committee was my favorite.
Documentary Now!,"Oh lord I ADORE Warner Herzog. His character on Jack Reacher is just the tip of the iceberg.

His POV is so grim, graphic and extreme, OVER. THE. TOP. 

His documentary on volcanoes: ""Zee Earth cares nothing for your stupid little dreams, it incinerates your stupid dreams and spits them out as ash and blinding smoke that chokes and fills your lungs with death,"" the first 9 words are a direct quote. The rest is in the spirit of WH.

WH describing something while making Fitzcarraldo: 
""standing in a sun-dappled, twittering Peruvian glade, he declares, 'The trees are in misery, and the birds are in misery. I don’t think they sing. They just screech in pain. . . . Taking a close look at what’s around us, there is some sort of harmony: it’s the harmony of overwhelming and collective murder.'""

I love this man!

It's from this article: 
https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/the-ecstatic-truth

Tubi has a great collection of his films and various documentaries about him."
Documentary Now!,What's he up to? What is he doing?
Documentary Now!,I just heard the Herzog impression clip on the NPR review  describing the two simultaneous projects and laughed so hard at a red light the driver next to me was certain I was a madman.
Documentary Now!,"Werner Herzog is a chronic animal abuser/torturer. Fuck him.

edit: to the people downvoting me, why? When you watch a Herzog film, you're watching horrific animal abuse on-screen. I provided a full list with examples in his films. Not sure why people are cool with that. 

Yes I think he is talented but I just can't get behind animal abuse."
Documentary Now!,"I always wanted to see a fight to the death between him and Klaus Kinski. Not sure who I would have wanted to win, tho."
Documentary Now!,I don’t think anyone asked since I don’t think anyone knew
Documentary Now!,"I am the biggest Documentary Now! Fan in the world. I couldn’t wait for this season! The last few seasons, hell from the start has been so damn good. This season (I’m up to date and next week is the finale) has fallen flat for me. Like big time.

Yea the episode in question is the best and only one I really liked much. I still think every episode should be an hour. Also the move away from Netflix kind of stinks. Well it does. No more access to the early seasons? I have YouTubeTV. And Hulu. And Netflix. I’m not getting some other plus channel or new service to have access. 

The episodes just haven’t been that funny. They nailed so many that were so good to the original. Just doesn’t feel the same. Hope next season is back as good. Because I know this show isn’t crazy popular so I would hate to see it go. It’s one of the best shows on TV! So unique and so so good. Nothing else like it ever."
Documentary Now!,"Werner Herzog's new line of kid's clothing:

Documentary Now!,I had no idea they had started doing episodes about real people. That sounds like it could be interesting.
Documentary Now!,Mellow and easy. Gentle and soft.
Documentary Now!,"Nice!

In case you really wanted to really know Alexander Skarsgård plays a *Werner Herzog type character* called Rainier Wolz who tries to make a sitcom pilot in a remote village

It was an amazing 2 part episode!"
Documentary Now!,With a cameo by H. R. Giger as played by Matt Gourley?
Documentary Now!,CBB and N4Y? hello!
Documentary Now!,"Nope, Alexander Skarsgård. He does an amazing job too, it's hysterical."
Documentary Now!,Cakeboss
Documentary Now!,You got floor all in my lima beans!
Documentary Now!,I have watched it so many times!!! It’s literally my favorite episode of anything ever. Pitter patter
Documentary Now!,"All seasons are on AMC+.

Also you get to watch episodes a week early on their streaming services.  I can watch episodes 1-3 of season 4."
Documentary Now!,"Seasons 1 is on Prime for like 12 more days. then season 4 and 2 are on IFC if you have cable or dish you can log in and watch them. Season 3 I really couldn’t find an easy way. 

Really complicated! I remember it use to be on Netflix. 

Season two is on youtube as well."
Documentary Now!,"The first three seasons play on one of the Pluto TV comedy channels for free, and I think they still have them available for on demand streaming as well."
Documentary Now!,"https://youtube.com/channel/UCpBwwlsBzq45pQfHR_HFepQ 

All three seasons are available on that YouTube channel. I don’t know if it is available in all countries though."
Documentary Now!,yo ho yo ho a pirates life for meeee
Documentary Now!,Paramount+ apparently!
Documentary Now!,Seasons 1-3 are on Netflix in America...nothing on S4 :/
Documentary Now!,I watched part 2 first and honestly didn't recognize him.  How they weren't cracking up all the time is beyond me.
Documentary Now!,The movie he ate the shoe for was [Gates of Heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Heaven)...
Documentary Now!,"He's a piece of shit who abuses and tortures animals.

edit: to the people downvoting me, why? When you watch a Herzog film, you're watching horrific animal abuse on-screen. Not sure why people are cool with that. The man went out of his way to be cruel to animals, it's all there on screen. Dude is the Michael Vick of movie directors but yeah lol funny man eat shoe"
Documentary Now!,"He also decided to move to Orlando to be closer to Disney World

Documentary Now!,"Reddit is a fucking echo chamber. Having a different opinion on here is like swimming up a waterfall. Everyone loves to shit on the biased propaganda spewed on sites like Facebook and on main stream media platforms, when in reality this platform is just as skewed."
Documentary Now!,No one is a Herzog fan because he's a good person. You can find a bad guy interesting and talented.
Documentary Now!,Should that exclude him from being the subject of comedic parody with which he has zero involvement -- to the extent thay they don't even use his actual name?
Documentary Now!,Why would you want Klaus Kinski to win? By all accounts he was a monster who probably sexually abused his daughters.
Documentary Now!,"It's 53, I think."
Documentary Now!,This is probably based on the doc ‘My best Fiend’
Documentary Now!,"To clarify, he makes both a documentary about the indigenous people of a remote area in the mountains between Russia and Kazakhstan, while simultaneously filming the pilot for a 90s era sitcom there. At the same time.

It's really fucking funny."
Documentary Now!,How can you not love hot soccer mom and the hunk?
Documentary Now!,"This episode was so fucking absurd and hysterical, loved it."
Documentary Now!,"""Yeah but a streaming service I have"" - all Redditors"
Documentary Now!,It's weird if you have AMC+ through Amazon prime. For some reason season 4 is separate from the other seasons in its own area.
Documentary Now!,"As a cable subscriber, I can also see episodes 1-3 on [IFC.com](https://IFC.com) (and S1 and S2, but not S3) with a provider login. But they're airing on IFC a week behind streaming."

Documentary Now!,Not in the US at least. I don’t see it.
Documentary Now!,"No, AMC+. [Also on IFC](https://www.ifc.com/) with a provider login."
Documentary Now!,"I actually don’t know about this. Can you tell me more. Maybe a piece of shit and I don’t know. He def makes incredible films.

Documentary Now!,"Sure.

- The animal abuse was so bad that the handler on set quit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu_the_Vampyre#Animal_cruelty

- In his film *Aguirre, The Wrath of God*, chickens are dropped from a cliff. A horse is beaten. A horse is thrown into a river and kicked. Monkeys are rampantly abused and thrown into a river.

- In *Fata Morgana*, a fox is carried by the throat.

- In *Stroszek*, a chicken on a hot plate (""dancing"", aka its feet are being burned) is shown.

- An abandoned project called *Game in the Sand* had animal abuse so out of control that even Herzog himself admitted it was a bit much. https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/4s9uyb/wtf_happened_with_the_rooster_in_werner_herzogs/

- I mean look at all these horrible examples for his film *Even Dwarves Started Small* : https://violence-hurt-animals-in-film.blogspot.com/2020/08/even-dwarfs-started-small.html

I also believe that the ""penguin walking away to its death"" scene in his documentary *Encounters at the End of the World* is staged. In that he abducted a penguin and displaced it far from its colony, causing it to walk endlessly to its death because it was lost. Purely for his film.


And it is not only animals. Herzog is also cruel to the actors he puts in his films, notably the mentally disabled man Bruno S, whom he had cast in two films. Herzog admitted to torturing and tormenting this man to get him in a certain frame of mind for his films.

Herzog is a real piece of shit, I hate how he's become kind of a meme that everyone loves and thinks is funny. He's evil."
Documentary Now!,"It really is. I mean it's funny how Reddit picks and chooses who is evil and who isn't. Like

Ellen, a bully = evil, unforgiveable, horrible person.

Herzog, who consistently tortured animals on screen = nah he's cool"
Documentary Now!,"I do find him talented, but when you're watching his films, you're literally watching the abuse on screen. That's what I can't get past."
Documentary Now!,"Article says it's ""Burden of Dreams."""
Documentary Now!,"Lol I mean it’s obvious why - there’s like 15 fuckin streaming services and they all have like 3 things worth watching 

We’ve come full circle - I think original cable was better than the clusterfuck we have with streaming services now."
Documentary Now!,"I commented this further down the thread but to make it easier I'll just put it here too. Herzog really is a terrible person. He is very talented but I honestly can't get past his horrible and unusual cruelty to animals, and people, for his films. It's hard in his case to separate art from artist, because his art is where all the abuse is. He abuses animals/people for his films, so it can't be ignored unless you dont watch them. Not sure how people are ok with supporting him, he goes out of his way to be mean.

Documentary Now!,Incredible this has been running for 53 seasons.
Documentary Now!,Love it
Documentary Now!,Let’s go!!!!
Documentary Now!,Do I need to be a big documentary watcher to get this humour? I watched the Grey Gardens episode and liked that since I was familiar with the original documentary it was based on. I often wonder if I ought to watch the documentary it’s based before watching another episode. I’d appreciate some navigation advice. Thanks.

But watch the rest of s3. It’s fantastic. 

The bowling episode and the musical episode might be my favourites of the whole run."
Documentary Now!,Final Transmission is such a good love letter to Stop Making Sense
Documentary Now!,I thought John Mulaney was fantastic in the Co-op episode.
Documentary Now!,Was he not good in this show or something? Haven't seen any episodes with him.
Documentary Now!,Oh I forgot we’re all onto the point with Mulaney where we hate him now. This anti-popular actor/comedian/whatever is so contrived.
Documentary Now!,"You seem to have left out an important part of the quote regarding John Mulaney. The article ACTUALLY says: “while John Mulaney will not appear on screen this season, he will return as a writer.” 

Not saying you did this intentionally, but your comment makes it sound like the author of the article dislikes Mulaney."
Documentary Now!,Bill not being involved makes this much less appealing. I’ll still give it a shot because I love the show but that’s really disappointing.
Documentary Now!,Paula Pell stole the show in that Original Cast Recording episode.
Documentary Now!,"Original Cast Recording is hysterical to me, I can’t count how many times I’ve rewatched that one episode."
Documentary Now!,"Tim Robinson shouting, “SUCK MY SACK!” is so ITYSL that I sometimes forget it’s actually from this episode."
Documentary Now!,"The musical is one of my favorite pieces of media, ever"

Flaked,"This is a universe in which their mailing system consists of dead babies mechanically altered into fucked up cherubs to carry messages around hive cities where the main food source is starches grown from ground up dead bodies.  


I really hope they can pull this off."
Flaked,As long as they choose a single story and run with it and don't succumb to scope creep I have faith it'll be awesome.
Flaked,Blood for the blood god.
Flaked,Just wait until you see the MSRP on each episode though
Flaked,Y’all don’t even know the amount of content buried in the GW vault
Flaked,">Henry Cavill is dragging the grim dark future of one of his nerdiest hobbies to the small screen. Don't know your T'au from your Tyranids? Here's the low-down.

Well, rule one is “T’au” are actually called Tau and T’au is their home world. GW muddied it all up a few years back because they couldn’t trademark the term “Tau”

Just one of several thousand examples of GWs hilarious antics"
Flaked,I need that random bug-hunt/SpaceHulk episode with nameless (expendable) marines.
Flaked,It's pretty much the opposite of star trek lol on a 10x timescale.
Flaked,"Wait, what? There's a ""new"" faction called ""Leagues of Votann""? They put Squats back in the game?"
Flaked,Never played 40K but have spent many hours reading wikis about it. Fascinating lore and great overarching theme. The grim dark tone is great. If anyone hasn't done so do check out a fan made film called Astartes on YouTube.
Flaked,"As a long term player and fan of the setting, I'm very sceptical about this making good television for a neutral audience."
Flaked,Warhammer 40k lore is DEEEP - so deep they'll have to pick a lane and stick with it I'm guessing. My biggest concern is how much they might choose to skip over...
Flaked,"36 hours later...""now you understand the basics of the Warhammer 40k universe. Now onto the Horus Heresy..."""
Flaked,Ciaphis Cain
Flaked,"Given Mr. Cavill's recent career rollercoaster, I feel like we might jinx him if we talk about his upcoming projects. We just quietly wait and then be like *gasp* ohmygod I didn't know Henry Cavill was starring in this! I loved him in the Witcher. ""

And so forth"
Flaked,I was told it would be Cavill painting miniatures.
Flaked,"Dave Bautista is either going to be cast in this or Gears of War. Hell, maybe both depending on how long each takes to get screen."
Flaked,I know nothing about this franchise other than I always thought the chunky space marine suits looked cool as fuck.
Flaked,"If we could just get Gaunt's Ghost TV adaptation with somebody like Anthony Starr as the titular character, I'd be perfectly fine at this rate. 

There are tons of more human focused stories within 40k that you could have a plethora of ideas developed before even considering focusing on a Space Marine centric idea. 

Warhammer 40k's range can be all over to place. From militaristic action with hints of Hogan's heroes, to something akin to Altered Carbon's Cyberpunk themes, to crime stories based in a hive city, and then to literal inspired Lovecraftian horror. Hell, Mad Max inspired Necromunda, or something that itches that Firefly or early 90s sci fi ideas with a Rogue Trader setting."
Flaked,I just really hope the narrative isn't entirely focused around the Ultramarines.
Flaked,It's goibng to be interesting to see how this gets adapted. There is so much lore across the 40K universe that it's inevitable large swathes get ignored. But I'm very intrigued by an adaption with Cavill at the front so fingers crossed they can pull it off.
Flaked,The empire is a beauracry so massive and inefficient that entire star systems are forgotten about because of a rounding error.
Flaked,"Bricky's 40K factions videos, [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCGKPRiJp84) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6jnsX77TCU) as well as the [Space Marine Legions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae2Beeleswc) video are a really great starting point to know about the universe of 40K. And when you think you want more, the time has come to dig into [Luetin's videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Luetin09/videos), especially his long-form lore videos which are really good."
Flaked,Man all I know about 40k is like 96% of the fanbase is gonna hate this show if it doesn't focus on their army choice. /s
Flaked,I just wish this wasn’t an Amazon thing. I hate supporting that scumbag company .
Flaked,Seeing 40k on this sub has brought a tear to my eye
Flaked,Easily [summarized](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-MeVxKZBOfM) by the late TB.
Flaked,"not sure why some people are worried about them not letting it be dark enough.

Amazon makes ""The Boys"" a story that is very dark and has next to no real good guys in it."
Flaked,Is this based on a true story?
Flaked,Still hoping he’s a custodes
Flaked,"Folks more knowledgeable: what’s the best first novel or short series in 40k fiction. I know basics of lore, but haven’t taken a deeper dive. The scope of the Horus Heresy series is daunting.

Edit: Thank you all for the recommendations! I know what I’ll be doing with Christmas book store gift cards. =D"
Flaked,If any of you wanna get hyped about Warhammer. Go watch the “Astartes” shorts on YouTube.
Flaked,Mentally preparing for it to be as good as the Halo tv show.
Flaked,Forge worlds are planet sized Amazon warehouses!
Flaked,"To me, the absolutely crucial thing is they don't start right out of the gate with space marines. 

I think this was one of the many reasons why the recent Halo series really sucked - they had nothing to build toward. The first scene was all about establishing master chief and his fellow supersoldiers as badass.

The thing is - that is something you should build towards.

One of the reasons why the Marvel Cinematic Universe thoroughly trounced DC was they built up each individual hero before throwing them together. 

DC immediately made a beeline for Superman vs Batman and it was terrible - that needed to be the culmination of a few movies worth of plotline, not a starting point.

Before they bring in the marines we need a lot, and I mean a lot, of plot involving regular ass guard or inquisition.

When a marine arrives it needs to be more of a force of nature than anything recognizably human. Massive, hulking and *fast*. 

I would like to see something like Eisenhorn on the trail of chaos and perhaps at the end of the season we get our first space marine action and it's damn near a blur of destruction it is so fast, and simply enormous. Our protagonist thought this cult had him and he was done. 

And that is *one* space marine. Not even an elite or legendary one. But that is what was whispered about in legend and something that maybe one in a billion people in the imperium actually witness - an astartes in action. 

But end of season teaser for season 2? Our protagonist finds evidence that the cult is bigger than he thought, and clues that there are more space marines around, as there was gruesome, wanton cultlike butchery. But this wasn't an imperial act. Whatever managed this massacre was a space marine alright, but not the kind that are loyal to the emperor.

Having seen what a marine is capable of, how the hell will he deal with a hostile one? Will he make contact with an actual space marine chapters knowing they may go full exterminatus on the whole planet over something like this? 

I know the temptation is to lead with marines from the beginning but goddamn, save that shit for *season 2*."
Flaked,i really hope they don’t whitewash the imperium in this to make cavil a hero
Flaked,"The 40k universe is largely just torture porn, but in a good way? Also the movie Event Horizon is considered to be canon and takes place in the far past"
Flaked,"My hope for the show is not to go with Space Marines. That they follow an Imperial Guard company and make it a show like Band of Brothers, then in the last climatic battle they can have Space Marines rock up to just destroy everything if they want. But save the space marines till later so that they seem even bigger and better than if they showed them straight away."
Flaked,"You’re gonna need a bigger article, but hope this turns you into some fans, the subreddit is pretty welcoming"
Flaked,"I’ve never known much about the 40k world, except that it’s expansive and Event Horizon is somehow related. Are there any good books for someone interested exploring the lore side of it, rather than the gaming?"
Flaked,"I haven’t played since like 2004, had a 2000pt Eldar army. Everything was just about getting my Avatar onto the Table. I don’t know if they’re even still a thing but I really wanna see an Eldar Avatar in live action."
Flaked,Where the hell do you start if you want to read the best of the best and skip the mediocre. I’m pretty picky about the quality of my fiction since there’s so many good books out there
Flaked,"[**Take a good look at this image here.**](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/629/527/large/tze-kun-chin-the-lady-and-the-knight.jpg?1514061454)

It's called *""The Lady and the Knight""* by Tze Kun Chin

If I were handling the 40k IP, this is the image would be the first thing I would hand any writers, producers, set designers, crew, etc. And insist that they physically sign it before I let them anywhere near the project. So they fully comprehend what the fuck this fictional setting *is*.

[The knight is that giant battlewalker in the background there. And that thing at the front is very much a lady. A callback to how a fair maiden blesses a knight on his way to battle](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/ladysfavor_godspeed.png)

But just LOOK at her! Enhanced to the point that she's an engorged, cybernetic skeleton. Held aloft by slaved servitor minds and mechatendrils. Leading a holy procession of blessing banners and flanked by the genetically engineered flying babies that reek of turned meat and preservation fluid. Speakers blaring battle honours and prayers to The God Emperor of Mankind.

And this isn't some fringe element of the fiction. This isn't the ""Mordor"" of the setting. Where everything is perfectly normal in the good guys camp. This is just a normal Tuesday on any random feudal knight world.

This fictional setting is absolutely insane. And anybody willing to adapt it must understand this. It's not the sort of thing where some face prosthetics and a pointy hat can cut the mustard.

To do this thing justice, one has to fully commit to this aesthetic.

------------------------------
**Edit** - Furthermore, this image would serve as the [""rubber ducky""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) of the script writing.

Whatever idea the writers come up with for a story, they're to face that image and *explain* it to The Lady. Picturing themselves momentarily at the head of that procession with her undivided attention. Amongst the cacophony of noise, in the swirling dust of ten-thousand years of skin cells and detritus, nostrils assaulted by the stink of those spectators who have starved. Now picked apart by carrion eaters.

Picture how The Lady reacts to being told an episode is about two characters *finding love*, or *finding themselves*, or the *importance of their skin colour or societal class*.

For to be a human in this setting is to be one among untold trillions. Your life merely currency of The God Emperor, to be spent at His discretion."
Flaked,Yeah something tells me Gizmodo isn’t the best source for this
Flaked,I can't wait until it's a little different from the source material and all the nerds Reeeeee likes it's a personal attack on them
Flaked,"I'd like to see the process of some recruits going through the trials of being a space marine.

It's not space marine wank material, but you'd get to see someone human go through some shit and become slowly less human.

Would give an opportunity to see space Marines and grand vistas of a space marine home world.

Or just give us a Gaunts Ghost series. It's perfect for a TV run"
Flaked,I love this so much
Flaked,I'm just ecstatic that Cavill gets to do something that he has a passion for without (hopefully) some other schmucks screwing it up.
Flaked,"I honestly feel sorry for whoever wrote this article because no matter how well they wrote it besides just ""its the future, shits fucked, it's supposed to be social commentary and satire"" people are going to throw in some pretty hard ACTUALLLLLIIIEEESSSS. It honestly wasn't that bad of an article and hit the waves tops pretty well (except they haven't read any of the newcron stuff like a lazy bum who probably only plays ultramarines)."
Flaked,I am so down for this
Flaked,This is a great primer. Concise and factual.
Flaked,"Imo go American horror story with it. Each season tell a different, fully self contained story."
Flaked,Not much faith in Amazon after Rings of Power and Wheels of Time.
Flaked,I hope the style is everything like astartes part 1-5
Flaked,Sounds awful
Flaked,I hope it will turn out better than the Witcher.
Flaked,"I think the important thing to remember is that what works for one medium doesn’t work for all. If you try to make books based too accurately around the rules of the table top you would have messy nonsense, same for when you make computer games or board games, different mediums require different nuances. 

If they try to make the series in such a way as to please all of the people that froth at the mouth over the lore it will be a shit series.

Accept it for what it is and you will probably enjoy it."
Flaked,"I cannot wait for this adaption with Cavill. I hope it’s good, rated R as fuck, and fully embraces the action and grim dark of 40k. If the story they tell in this series works we could see a plethora of 40k stories brought to the screen and the lore is so deep it’s be amazing. 

Horus, flight of the Eisenstein, Trayzn, Commissar Yarrick, Ghazghkull. Fuck it could be great."
Flaked,"It’s likely to suck as it’s going to be made for the wider audience, not fans."
Flaked,"So is Hollywood gonna put yet another group of Directors and writers that become, allegedly, aggressive against  ever staying faithful to the original material?

‘Cause if they do, i rather those guys go in with the Mindset of Starship Troopers."
Flaked,"40000? I have never heard it called that. 

It’s called 40k by everyone I know."
Flaked,"I have been waiting for a TV show or movie in this universe to happen. I've been interested in the universe for a long, long time, but the barrier to entry was just too much for me."
Flaked,Honestly think anything but animated is doing this IP a dis-service tbh. No way in hell is live action possible
Flaked,"I have three hopes for this show
1.	 That they mail the Grimdarkness of it
2.	That they stick to the lore
3.	That newcomers get into it. 

It’s gonna be hard to pull off."
Flaked,I love the idea of 40K but the cost has always kept me away. Is there a good place to get into the story (I know the universe is huge)?
Flaked,Does this mean all the stuff from the games workshop streaming service will run on Amazon?  Hammer and bolter was fun and I would like to rewatch it and not have that service.
Flaked,"Should they do the reunification of terra ?

Focusing on the reveal of th emperor and the thunder warriors the eventual betrayal of them. Laying the foundation for the Imperium of man.


Fighting against the techno barbarians.
On terra.

Leading up to the creation of space marines and maybe leading up to the bigger evil at the end the forces of chaos.

This can probably serve as a prequel series into the Horus heresy"
Flaked,"I know basically nothing about Warhammer 40k, but it seems like HIGH high fantasy to me. Much closer to Warcraft than Game of Thrones.

Something this wild will be tough to pull off in live action without an absurdly high budget. And since Warhammer isn't exactly mainstream compared to other franchises, I can't imagine Amazon pumping a lot of money into it.

I don't see why they can't make it animated. Seems like a much better fit."
Flaked,Spoiler alert: Gunna be dog shit.
Flaked,"I'll pretty much watch anything with Henry Cavill in it. I don't know anything about Warhammer, but Henry is so genuine, such a good dude, plays a number of roles well, and to top it off he is a gamer."
Flaked,Amazon have butcherd every major franchise adaptation they've touched. I have no doubt they'll do it again.
Flaked,"I don’t want to gatekeep warhammer 40k but even if you read this article it won’t help because it takes many years of reading lore that may or may not be Canon in a giant mess of a universe filled with plot hole,plot armour and best of many years of fan theory that has been slowly widespread and accepted clouding what is and isn’t correct or accurate."
Flaked,This is going to be one giant disaster
Flaked,"I really hope this turns out well, not only because I like WH40k, but particularly for Cavill's sake.

Poor dude has been getting one rough work deal after another, that whole Witcher situation turned out just particularly sad."
Flaked,Everyone is bad. There are no good guys...
Flaked,I hope they link it to Event Horizon.🤞
Flaked,"I think the real question is how they can work in a teenage sidekick. You know, someone the youth audience can identify with. 

Also, can the god emperor be a woman? This is so over time the emperor can grow and become socially aware."
Flaked,"If his show pops off. It's gonna be interesting seeing 40k get popular in the mainstream. I'm still getting used to most ""nerd culture"" being so celebrated now I guess"
Flaked,I just binged lore videos and this seems like a universe where a show could go anywhere or just be a new story. Allows for more creativity than Witcher maybe
Flaked,I hope Amazon comes out with officially licensed cleaning products for the fans.
Flaked,I feel like they can’t do 40k justice with a tv show. Seems a bit too dark. Not to mention the demonic stuff which will get politicized to the extreme.
Flaked,"Inb4: ""WHY ARE THERE NO FEMALE SPACE MARINES!?""

I mean this is the setting that got attacked by PETA because one of their fictional factions has a boner for wolf-pelts and skulls.  The solution? ""They're not wolves. There are no wolves on Fenris."" - a cryptic sentence which was later revealed as ""yeah, those wolves are mutated original settlers of the planet"".

It is the most racist, bigoted, hateful setting ever where religious zealots actively hunt down and kill anyone who doesn't confirm to a preconceived standard or who, at least, doesn't agree to be dragged into indentured servitude over the course of generations.

It doesn't matter if you're black, white, Asian etc just so long as you're human. What matters is blind faith in the Emprah and even more millennia unreasoning hatred!

And no, the Omnissiah is the Emperor you degenerate cogboys."
Flaked,This is going to flop so hard...
Flaked,"Normally I would roll my eyes and toss anything coming out of hollywood into ""this is going to suck"" bin, but cavill supposedly having some control over it, is the only thing giving me any hope this will be good.  He is a true nerd and wants to be faithful to the source material.  Then the otherside of the coin we have Amazon, which has been a mixed bag, but lately their stuff has gotten worse, with the infamous LOTR for example.  So for once in a long while, I will hold a wait and see approach."
Flaked,Ok but which sexy character will be play for us to thirst over?
Flaked,"eh, 40k lore is so incredibly layered with dozens of factions, chapters, sects, sub-sects and sects out of sub-sects and renegade cults out of those sub-sub-sects it's gonna be some real hard work making a serie out of it BUT Cavill will not want to risk another Witcher disaster, so I'm hopeful for it to be at least decent"
Flaked,Any bets on what role henry cavil is gonna play? My money is on a primarch or maybe a grey knight but i guess it really depends on the timeframe they want to set the show in.
Flaked,Why is this article written with so much venom towards cavill? Did I miss something?
Flaked,"Boy, sure hope we get to see a live action daemonculaba! 

:-)"
Flaked,"""Before Henry Cavill explains it...""

Man, these people hate him."
Flaked,I don’t trust amazon with this. Let’s hope it’s not adapted with modern themes and with the modern audience in mind and just be faithful to the story
Flaked,Am I the only one that thinks a season (or seasons) based off Uriel Ventris and the Ultramarine books would be amazing?!
Flaked,So.... howmuch does Cavill really know about Warhammer and WH 40k?
Flaked,GW can suck it till they add clauses to keep parody fan animations safe.
Flaked,One (1) Culture GSV > entire 40K universe
Flaked,What I would like to see is them partnering up with Brava Alfabusa. Make a live-action ITEHATTSD show. DO IT.
Flaked,Can't wait for Twitter to find out orks exist in this franchise too

Netflix Presents: The Characters,"The Pointer Brothers sketch is maybe my favourite sketch from anything ever. I will never stop watching it, it's perfect."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"I think the actual series was a fair bit stronger than the characters episode, but ""The Detroiters"" is definitely a good follow up, even though it's not exactly the same style."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"i think the sammy paradise skit is the best one tim has done so far to be honest. it cracks me up just thinking about it 

*lady luck, oh, lady luck*"
Netflix Presents: The Characters,[deleted]
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I didn't quite like how a lot of the skits devolved in to shouting but damn was it funny. The shirts with the pull buttons is so on point it's hysterical.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Definitely watched it because I saw that his episode had former Conan O'Brien sketch actor Brian McCann in it. He was the head guy in that sketch with all of those guys making fun of him and pranking him.  Brian McCann is exactly the type of guy you want for a zany sketch show.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"JONATHAN FRAKES: ""And what about the story of the extra episode of the niche Netflix comedy show? Could such a thing really have happened?""

Netflix Presents: The Characters,"Tim's episode was GREAT!   
The other ones were almost aggressive in how unfunny they were though.   
(Oh, and can I use your bathroom...?)"
Netflix Presents: The Characters,The Characters is from 2016. Detroiters was more recent and probably contributed more towards getting Tim’s series.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Thanks for this! I need more and I’ll check this out later in the wait for S2.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,How does this show compare to Detroiters?
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Show's about to staa-aart
Netflix Presents: The Characters,DAMMIT WAGU! THAT'S GONNA SET US BACK!

Netflix Presents: The Characters,I don't get it. I've seen the meme (but not the show it's from) but this is true.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Yeah I watched some of the other ones and found them all horrible. I suppose that's why only Tim got a whole show.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Sketch comedy like I Think You Should Leave compared to the structured premise show of Detroiters.

Netflix Presents: The Characters,I'm thrilled. Lauren Lapkus is amazing. Her characters on Comedy Bang! Bang! are consistently hilarious. 
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I like to think I keep current with the comedy world but to be honest out of all of those comedians the only one I recognize is Lauren Lapkus.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"It's an interesting experiment, but not a single one of those clips was funny.  I'll give Netflix the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not too hopeful.  "
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I'm glad Netflix is willing to experiment more on the format of what makes a TV show. There should really be more things like this. I'll definitely be checking it out. 
Netflix Presents: The Characters,huh. that's all i got to say.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"Henry Zebrowski is hilarious. If you haven't listened to the podcast he's on, The Last Podcast on the Left, you should, cause it's hilarious. He was also in the new Hero's show and The Wolf of Wall Street. "
Netflix Presents: The Characters,EEEuuuueeeuuuhhh. I'm not sold.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Hell of a cast of up and comers. Little hard to get a handle on what the show will be from this trailer. Netflix is really steaming along with their originals though. Hardly any misses. 
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Ho-Ho the naughty elf?!

Netflix Presents: The Characters,Looks annoying than funny.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I think that's the point. It said next generation of comedians. These are some up-and-comers with probably little screen experience.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Then the trailer did a good job. They're all supposed to be unrecognized.

Netflix Presents: The Characters,Tim Robinson was on SNL for a season. Now he's just a writer for them though.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I found the blind detective amusing but otherwise they fell flat
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"Everyone said the same thing about F is for Family and W/ Bob & David, and they turned out pretty good. I'd rather have a bad trailer for a good series than a good trailer for a bad series."

Netflix Presents: The Characters,She must be poah!
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"I don’t understand, she sold her story to vanity fair for $300k, came out smelling like a rose, and I didn’t feel like she was ever shown as anything but a victim. As far as Anna’s portrayal, I thought she was shown as being a grifter and a con artist."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"I never got the sense she was a 'backstabbing freeloader' 

I'd imagine it's awkward being friends with someone rich. If they want to socialise to their normal standards, they do have to pay for their friends. but I don't think the show ever implied she was only friends with Anna for the perks. 

As for the backstabbing, Anna clearly betrayed her. Reporting her to the police was 100% the right call and justified."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"This disclaimer is going to wipe this case off the map:

>It includes a whimsical disclaimer: “This story is completely true. Except for the parts that are totally made up.”

SCOTUS already ruled on this in People vs. Larry Flynt. Satirical representations of real people are fair game according to the 1st Amendment."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"Backstabbing? No, but freeloader for sure. Some characters in the show do say she betrayed Anna, but i thought that was just stupid."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I don't think she was portrayed that bad honestly.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"This is really interesting to me, I’d like to see how this goes for her.

I don’t know the actually dramatized facts underneath Inventing Anna.  I watched the show and it was clear that the show runners were trying to bury Rachel in a way that felt fake, like there was a personal vendetta there.  It was so bizarre watching the show when they’re treating her like she’s not a victim here also, and that she deserves to have her life destroyed.

If you haven’t seen the show before, I’d recommend it.  One of the stranger TV shows I’ve ever seen because the show runner’s points of view on the matter are so blatant and so bizarre."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I really hope this goes nowhere.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"A) This seems like exactly the kind of thing the character would do 

B) It wasn’t a documentary. It’s a work of fiction based on a true story. I didn’t bother to read the article, but I am curious what damages she’s claiming."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Just what a backstabbing freeloader would do.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Wasn’t there a disclaimer in the corny opening of each episode?
Netflix Presents: The Characters,She did get the short end of the stick from the portrayals. Everyone else was played by someone hotter and Rachel got played by someone uglier and more than 10 years older.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,It’s not a fucking documentary. She can Fuck off with this frivolous shit

Netflix Presents: The Characters,"I think I made it like 10-15 minutes into this before giving up. Didn't get any of the hype, but surprised to hear anyone stuck with it long enough to have an opinion."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,What? They lied to tell a better story? Next you are gonna tell me that those children didn’t actually fight a bunch of inter dimensional monsters with their psychic friend?!
Netflix Presents: The Characters,The story line was ok but the entire pregnancy bullshit throughout the movie was fucking annoying
Netflix Presents: The Characters,So bow-ring
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"There's definitely a pro-Anna anti-Rachel tone throughout the show. Anna is presented as a brilliant schemer, while Rachel is shown as a freeloading wannabe. It's also implied that Rachel may have volunteered to pay for the Morocco hotel, but that's backed up by the IRL evidence that she lost her previous lawsuit against Delvey."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"If I understood correctly she sold her story when she was about to be fired and blacklisted. So it was the only way to save her career and have her money back. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Also, if must had been terrifying being on her position in Morocco. Is bad enough when your card doesn't work in your country"
Netflix Presents: The Characters,It’s her guilt that makes her feel targeted and her greed that made her sue Netflix.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I thinks she's spent the 300k and is looking for another payday...
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"Oh didn't know she sold for 300k I commented ""nice"". I got to change it. To"" not nice"""
Netflix Presents: The Characters,No one in that show comes out even remotely likable.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"The show makes Rachel seem like the villain in the whole scenario though.  We have characters like Vivian and the Scriberia crowd thrilled over Anna dodging a conviction for this, and otherwise sympathetic characters like Neff and Kacy implying that Rachel is a racist and verbally berating her for “betraying” Anna."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Always a sure sign that someone knows the law when they cite the name of the movie instead of the court case.
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"There is a high bar for winning a defamation case in the US. 


From the article:

> For defamation cases against high-profile public figures to succeed, there must be a showing that the allegedly defamatory statements were made with actual malice. There must be an intent to harm with prior knowledge that what was said is false, or a reckless disregard for the truth. Several defamation suits, including ones filed by Donald Trump, Sarah Palin and a person who sued over his portrayal in The Wolf of Street, have failed to meet the standard."
Netflix Presents: The Characters,"Wasn't there a similar disclaimer for Vice, the one about Dick Cheney?"
Netflix Presents: The Characters,Idk if they tried to say she wasn’t a victim but they were trying to say Anna thought she wasn’t a victim
Netflix Presents: The Characters,I honestly thought that was just because of the actress’s portrayal of her; she played Quinn on Scandal and it was the same type of character lol

Good job Louise. Good job."
Cuckoo,"Louise Fletcher played some of the most hateable monsters out there, Kai Winn and Nurse Ratched, evil because they are real people that actually do / could exist. Absolutely awesome actress. RIP."
Cuckoo,"Very few actors can play a character so well you truly despise them. Goddamn was she so good as Kai Winn. She really made you hate her but played it so believable. 

Rest well."
Cuckoo,"She's with the Prophets now, my child.

Seriously though, I think Kai Winn was probably in the running for her second best known role, at least among nerds."
Cuckoo,"One of the most compelling pure presences Trek has ever had on screen. Toe to Toe with Avery and everyone else she interacted with on that cast. Although I believe Nurse Ratched was more of a lawful evil type and the Kai was more of a neutral evil, both characters shared some traits with Nurse Ratched. Louise's level of talent was needed to pull off the fact that you could never quite get a good read on her."

I gotta be honest, this sounds kind of lovely, there are way worse ways to go. Rest in peace."

Cuckoo,"It always seems to be that the more awful the characters they played onscreen are, the nicer the actors playing them are.

Given how her characters were some of the most truly awful, unappealing, perverse, hateful and all-round disgusting individuals ever to grace our screens, she must have been a bloody saint in real life.

Either way, she was a truly talented actor. RIP."
Cuckoo,I loved her in Big Eden .
Cuckoo,Really talented and highly underated actress (imo). Always got apprehensive when I saw her on screen. She was so good at being bad!
Cuckoo,https://youtu.be/0_ZHlAtn0d4
Cuckoo,Holy crap I'm watching shameless for the first time and I just watched the episode where she dies.
Cuckoo,May she walk with the Prophets.
Cuckoo,I remember her as the grandmother from Flowers in the Attic. I remember being utterly terrified of her.
Cuckoo,"Kai Wynn,  such a detestable character played with effortless expertise"
Cuckoo,"Nurse Ratchet was one of greatest villains because she got others to believe she was doing it for the patients best interest but it was really all about her having control.

Oh I just hated her and how she destroyed those men with her righteousness.

Brilliantly acted."
Cuckoo,"This movie left me with a visceral sense of despair and hopelessness when it ended. And er character was a big reason why. 

a great movie but I don't think I can ever watch it again. It's been at least 15 years since I saw it and I still strongly remember the feelings it evokes."
Cuckoo,"And it was always the way she delivered the word ""child"" at the end of her lines.  So rage inducing."
Cuckoo,"God Kai Winn was so well acted. One of the all-time great villains. Walk with the prophets, Louise."
Cuckoo,"And in just 14 episodes across 7 years, it's amazing how much presence she had."
Cuckoo,"If you haven't watched Midnight Mass already, I highly suggest it. The character, Bev has some major Kai Wynn, using religion for their own power plays, vibes to her. She is fantastic villain that you will love to hate."
Cuckoo,The Ultimate Space Karen
Cuckoo,"Every time she was on screen, even before she delivered a single line, I knew I’d hate whichever character she was playing.

Here’s to you, actor lady who was skilled in playing Karen’s decades before we all knew to hate Karen."
Cuckoo,Should have been Umbrage in Harry Potter
Cuckoo,"And what is so amazing about that is every interview I’ve ever heard with her costars, everybody was unanimous in exclaiming what a sweet and lovely person she was."
Cuckoo,She was the principal in high school high. Hard ass who was also secretly a drug dealer.
Cuckoo,Also the grandmother in the original Flowers in the Attic.
Cuckoo,Don’t forget the grandmother in the original Flowers in the Attic. She was pure evil!!
Cuckoo,To me she will always be Kai Winn over Nurse Ratched. She was such a glorious villain. The passive aggressive vileness just oozed off of her. You loved to hate her.
Cuckoo,"Louise also appeared in a recurring role on the Showtime television series Shameless in 2011 and 2012, as Frank Gallagher's foul-mouthed and hard-living mother who is serving a prison sentence for manslaughter.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YOBljWpZhlI"
Cuckoo,Bajor weeps
Cuckoo,"They were both all about using the established system of rules to advance themselves, they were both Lawful Evil. Lawful evil characters don't actually respect or value law and order, they use it and maintain an appearance of being law abiding while twisting things to their advantage all they can."
Cuckoo,She definitely made me want to punch my screen
Cuckoo,"Samantha Sloyan. I think she's going to be in Flanagan's Midnight Club too, next month."
Cuckoo,"I watched it right when it came out, and Bev had the exact same thing going on.

She was awful too."
Cuckoo,I hear that quite frequently about actors that were famous for playing evil people. One that immediately comes to mind is Margaret Hamilton.
Cuckoo,[Acting.](https://tenor.com/bpPpP.gif)
Cuckoo,Louise Fletcher's acceptance speech at the Oscars really shows that sweetness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGl5U7nNlkY
Cuckoo,Ernie Hudson was a principal who dealt drugs too
Cuckoo,Oh my god I forgot about her in that show!
Cuckoo,Hmm I can see WYN being neutral evil. She puts on the air of being lawful but will happily break the rules if she can get away with it.
Cuckoo,"Jason Isaacs is one that always comes to mind when this topic comes up. He's played some true bastards, and by all accounts seems like a really nice, genuine guy."
Cuckoo,Ronny Cox as well
Cuckoo,"Same with Katherine MacGregor who played Mrs. Oleson on Little House on the Prairie. Horrid bitch of a character, reportedly a warm and kind lady irl."
Cuckoo,"oh wow! ‘If you’ll excuse me’

*cries*"
Cuckoo,"Ernie Hudson has had a crazy cool career too, granted not as consistently playing hate-able characters (I’d say quite the opposite)."
Cuckoo,"I agree, if Winn were 100% lawful, she would not have broken her code that Cardassians are always the enemy once she realized she could use them for personal gain at the end of season 7.

Neutral evil is more appropriate imo."
Cuckoo,But lawful evil characters break the rules all the time. They don't value rules and law except as they can be used to better their own position. They rely on rules and law to protect themselves but not bind themselves.
Cuckoo,"Lawful is about methods, not values."
Cuckoo,"No lawful Evil bends the rules, twists them and uses them to their advantage. They do not outright break them because you know they would not be lawful. What you are describing in very much neutral evil."
Cuckoo,"I don't agree, it still includes orthogonal intent and philosophical consistency

Someone who takes over supreme leadership *because* their internal code says Cardassians need to be stopped by any means necessary is a lawful act based on their internal code.

Someone who takes over supreme leadership and *compromises* their internal code and works with the Cardassians to achieve that is doing a chaotic act, and thus obviously Kai Winn is lawful in other ways, I settle on neutral"
Cuckoo,"Disagree entirely. The prototypical lawful evil character is a corrupt judge. Lawful vs Chaotic isn't about values (that's good vs evil), it's about methods."
Cuckoo,"I don't think lawful evil characters have a strict internal code. Lawful vs Chaotic is about methods, not values."
Cuckoo,"Not sure in you interpretation of neutral evil is then.   
I am going off the very descriptions of the alignments back in the 80’s"
Cuckoo,"Anyone who is interested in doing a Boston Legal watch/ re-watch should know that ""The Practice"" Season 8 is basically Boston Legal Season 0.

It shows how Denny and Alan got together and some background info on some of the main characters. It is worth starting there to get the full story."
Cuckoo,James Spader is my hero and Denny Crane is my spirit animal
Cuckoo,TRACY JORDAN: I watched Boston Legal 9 times before I realized it wasn’t a new Star Trek.
Cuckoo,The show is worth it just for James Spader’s courtroom monologues alone.
Cuckoo,Namby... Pamby...
Cuckoo,Great show with an impressive cast. The balcony scenes at the end of the episodes are my favorites.
Cuckoo,"Denny Crane, name’s on the door."
Cuckoo,Denny Crane shooting that guy is one of my favorite scenes ever
Cuckoo,"""Flamingos.""

Has me crying with laughter every time it comes up."
Cuckoo,"It's so, so good. I've watched the first two seasons multiple times. I wasn't a huge fan of Monica Potter and I preferred it after Julie Bowen joined the cast. The episode with the witches and the episode about the farmed salmon are two of my favorites."
Cuckoo,"James Spader is fking brilliant.

The show is great, I've lost count the times I've binged it."
Cuckoo,One of my all-time favorites.
Cuckoo,Denny Crane.
Cuckoo,"I rewatched the entire show around this time last year as a matter of fact. Lots of episodes I never saw while it was on TV, and I actually never got to even see the 5th season, so that was nice to get some closure. 

I actually would love to hear what alan shore's thoughts are on what the world is like now, as well as the outrageous things denny would say. 

Also before rewatching the show I decided to watch the last season of the practice, where they brought alan shore in, just because I wanted to see what he and denny were like before the more comedic boston legal. I definitely found it interesting watching that last season of the practice and then straight into boston legal. The sudden change, the metaness, everything set the tone for what this show would be like, and it was a blast to watch."
Cuckoo,Anyone remember Boston Public? Wonder how that held up
Cuckoo,"It's a great show but I found I enjoyed it less as it progressed. As the morality of Alan Shore improves and he becomes less self-destructive, he becomes a little less interesting as a character. It sort of collapses under the weight of its own soap opera elements by the end, and it was the right time to end it narratively imo.

The Good Wife picked up its mantle I thought."
Cuckoo,"Denny Crane, cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs."
Cuckoo,"Oh, what good news! With all that's happening these days, I would love to still have Alan around."
Cuckoo,I think I've watched most of the episodes but the strongest thing I remember about the show  remember are the 'controversies' about Spader's Emmy wins. It was like the broadcast networks final stand.
Cuckoo,I just finished Boston Legal 2 weeks ago. Just an absolutely outstanding show. Alan Shore closings will forever be close to my heart. I miss Denny and Alan's bromance already
Cuckoo,Shatner and Spader are fantastic in it. Now I want to do a re-watch.
Cuckoo,Shatner could never get away with his over the top predator imitation these days but eminently hilarious.
Cuckoo,"I wonder how it's aged tbh?

I loved it when it aired and was upset when it ended. But from what I remember (and I could be wrong), James Spade's (and maybe even William Shatner's characters 'enjoyed the ladies', so I wonder how the humour would hold up in the post 'me too' etc times? 

Personally I probably will never rewatch it in case it isn't as good as I remember, but like 24, it was wonderful 'at the time', but the times have changed. 

Could be the same for Boston Legal tbh?"
Cuckoo,"I watched BL when it was on originally, and recently started it again, but this time with my wife. She’s always been skeezed out by Spader and Shatner, but loves them on this show. One time I pissed her off about something, looked her straight in the eye and said “Denny Crane”. She let me skate..."
Cuckoo,It can be seen for free on Cackle TV.
Cuckoo,"I've seen this show being praised a lot and decided to try and watch it recently and was shocked by how insane the first episode was (not in a good way). Now I finally know where all the parodies of a 'generic lawyer show' came from- that show is basically some horny lawyer thinking 'what if all the lawyers I work with were like, supermodel hot, and fucked each other all the time'. The music on some of the bits is straight out of a porn movie and it feels like they just wanted to shoot softcore porn in a loose lawyer setting but couldn't convince any of the actors to do nudity. 

And the camera work+directing is ridiculous, like here, in this scene https://streamable.com/4mh9bp it feels like the camera operator is trying their hardest not to do the constant zoom in/out at the end so the director can add some zany sound effects later. It's like a student movie."
Cuckoo,"I have been rewatching and I just love it.  It makes me miss those days immensely.  Wow what a change from then until now.  

Only thing is and I cannot understand is why “Denny Crane” has to be so annoying.  He cannot for the life of him endure a case by himself and portrays to be the main character of the show.  Also the background music is soooo annoying (that scream singing over and over and over… what is that?)

I do wonder what happened to Rhona Mitra and some of the Season 1 actors.  I also wonder why they couldn’t have any of “The Practice” actors on either.  I’m still waiting for Lara Flynn Boyle to enter as our beloved ADA.  And of course the obvious and to your point I can’t find anything on the internet as to why they cancelled this series.  It’s so great.  I much prefer “Boston Legal” over the “Blacklist”"
Cuckoo,It always bothered me that John Laraquette played a murderer turned lawyer in the Practice and a different lawyer in Boston Legal despite sharing the same universe.
Cuckoo,"I thought about mentioning this (I went back and watched only season 8 of the practice after Boston Legal ended and I needed more). But the feel of The Practice is very different from Boston Legal. Same characters / universe, but much more serious and less comedic. I was afraid to suggest people start here lest it discourage them from hanging on through Boston Legal (I definitely didn't like The Practice as much). But I 100% agree that it's mandatory viewing for any fan of Alan Shore."
Cuckoo,"Practice is a great show though, and it needs more fans.  It is the serious counter-part to Boston Legal and Ally McBeal"
Cuckoo,"This would be a good bumper sticker.

Their evening session on the balcony with scotch and cigars, enjoying each other's company while recalling the events of the day - that's probably my deepest desire. Everything about it is wonderful."
Cuckoo,Had two alumni.  Kirk and Oddo.
Cuckoo,"""Schadenfreude"""
Cuckoo,Shocking...and outrageous!
Cuckoo,Donny Crane
Cuckoo,">Denny Crane shooting that guy is one of my favorite scenes ever

*Do you know how little that narrows it down?*

But seriously, doesn't he shoot like 2 or 3 people over the course of the show?"
Cuckoo,You mean Julie Bowen?
Cuckoo,Smell that shoe
Cuckoo,">It sort of collapses under the weight of its own soap opera elements by the end, and it was the right time to end it narratively imo.

Every David E. Kelley show ever."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I think nobody is talking about Joel and Tess being together for at least 13 years. That was huge revelation for me. Makes Joel’s loss that much bigger.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,The most important part of the episode is Joel understanding the message Bill left for him. Joel is now on board with getting Ellie to this lab to find a cure. It’s why he asked her to show him her arm again.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,From the tension in the piano scene I thought someone was going to die.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"The way the episode was directed was fantastic in my opinion. I like that they don't need to show the couple's corpse at all, it was done really well. In the end of the episode when they were zooming out the window I'm going ""pleeease don't show them, we don't need to"" and sure enough they didn't! Great episode."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Once that Max Richter song came on to start off that montage, I was like ""guess this is my cue to cry happy sad tears now"""
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Nick Offerman should win an Emmy for his performance
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"This was one of the most moving, but yet not overly dramatic portrayals of love I’ve seen in a long time. It’s inspiring, relatable and just very well done."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"While everyone is rightfully praising the actors, I want to shout out to the writer Craig Mazin for fleshing out a side character and gave us this beautiful story. 

Mazin was also responsible for writing Chernobyl, which also had some beautiful writing with amazing character relationships."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I wasn't expecting the direction this episode took at all.

Nick Offerman made me cry.

Everyone can have their own opinion but to me this was art, not filler."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Joel explained how the fungus rapidly spread through tainted food. This shined light on how the elderly neighbor was infected in Episode 1.

Edit: Plus Joel forgot to get a cake from the store, which presumably would have infected his family too."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I'm hearing either, ""Best episode ever made!"" or ""What the hell was that, pointless!""

It wouldn't be interesting if everyone agreed I guess."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This episode was perfectly produced. My only complaint was when bill just shooting from the middle of the street with no cover.. bill seem way more intelligent than that from everything else we saw in the episode.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"It was well made, told a kind of slice-of-life story about living in the post apocalypse. Well written, well shot, well acted.

I can't rightly think of another episode like it that isn't filled to the brim with various genre tropes like one of them getting inevitably infected."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"It was incredible to see Bill’s growth as a person once Frank came into his life. From an angry, closed-off, highly introverted man to someone who became happy, open and loving. His vulnerability in the very beginning of their relationship and Frank’s patience and calming presence was one of the most moving things I have ever witnessed in a television show. The scene where he and Frank giggled over strawberries was truly heartwarming. I genuinely started crying when they revealed that Frank was terminally ill and love that their journey ended together. Nick Offerman should absolutely win an award for his role in this episode. It is some of the best television that has ever been made."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I loved this episode. I can forgive a deviation from the source material if the new material is written well and executed well. And this episode did exactly that. Nick Offerman killed it
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Nick Offerman laughing at the strawberries was the moment that got me. That laugh of pure, unburdened joy. It was perfectly used."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Honestly didn't expect to cry so hard to an episode of The Last of Us about a gay romance of two one shot side characters
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,As a massive fan of the game since day 1 & never usually like something deviating TOO far from an original story... I thought that episode was fucking incredible
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,All this from a video game adaptation. We've come so fucking far.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This episode slayed me. Was totally unprepared. Beautiful.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"People asked what more a show could do to expand on TLOU and this is exactly it. It’s expanding on the heart of characters trying to survive in a post apocalyptic world.

I genuinely cried, it was amazing"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I've been very happy theyre sticking to the OG story so closely. This is the first major change theyve made and its great. These are side characters I barely even remember existing, so they play a minimal role in the story. Fleshing out their backstory doesnt detract at all. The addition of a well written, well acted side story like this adds immensely though"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"No episode of tv has made me cry like that since Not Penny’s Boat, that’s all I’ll say"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I appreciated the nods to Ron Swanson's birthday dinner.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SHrmGdIzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0SHrmGdIzo)"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I don’t feel anything very easily. Nick Offerman is one of those actors that I have had this idea of in my head as being a one-trick pony. Boy, was I wrong. This episode had me weeping. I walked away feeling all kinds of stuff I can’t even explain."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Ugly crying!
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Just finished the episode. As a long time proponent of please stick to the source material I can safely say that this episode was just absolutely fantastic.

Performances are tremendous, it fleshes out the world the characters inhabit, how they’ve changed over the course of time in a world that’s hopeless. 

If you want a 1 for 1 retelling of exactly how the game is, go play it but for me this  is a video game adaptation (key word is adaptation) done exactly right 

I hope both guys get nominated for many awards for their performance."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I haven’t been broken like this from a TV episode in a looooong time
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"> The Last of Us' just made an early claim to ~~one of~~ the best TV episode~~s~~ of 2023

Only been a month, and maybe Succession will give it a run for its money, but so far it's way out in front. One of the best episodes of television I've ever seen.

This show was just like, ""by the way, here's the most beautiful and devastating love story ever squeezed into an hour"" while helping establish a totally authentic post-apocalyptic setting and give leagues of depth and subtext to the stories of Joel and Tess, all in passing."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,[removed]
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,[removed]
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Much preferred their story here than the game’s version and glad some story beats are changing.

My biggest complaint before was that it I personally was finding a 1 for 1 recreation slightly uninteresting (feels like a harsh word as I’m still think this is a fantastic tv show), part of me was wishing I was just playing the game instead.

This episode was a brilliant change of pace, a perfect filler episode."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,It was a good episode for sure.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Love the ending shot is through the bedroom window. However it bugs me that it looks like it is a second floor window but their bedroom is on the ground floor for easy access.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I think this was the first time I actually cried while watching something incredible performance
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I think a lot of the criticism of it being a filler episode is from people who lack media literacy. It is really not difficult to see how the story told in the ep fleshes out and contextualises some of the wider themes of the game/show
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"At the end of that episode I crawled into my boyfriends lap and cried for ages. Best bit of telly I’ve seen in a long time, absolutely amazing writing and performances."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"""I like you older. Older means we're still here."""
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Well, this is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.  
  
My *emotions*."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I do like that they used a mortal kombat 2 machine instead of the fictional arcade cabinet
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,“I never liked you…but I do respect you.” Straight up Ron Swanson.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I totally recognize that the episode was sad because of the ending, but I couldn’t help but feel happy for Bill & Frank. In all that chaos, they built a great life together. Frank had all those amazing paintings, Bill overcame his grudge against humanity, they grew strawberries!!

How many people get undisturbed time (work, school,  obligations) for over a decade with the person they love?  I was really happy and proud of them for that.

Also, very classy of TV Ellie not to raid Bill’s magazine collection, 😂"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"When bill was shooting in the street, it was so dumb tho."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I adored it. Felt like one of those classic artsy post-apocalyptic short stories you might have read in high school. But gay as hell.

I also thought the bedroom scene hit exactly the right notes. Not too schmaltzy, not too lurid, but not shying away from it either. It was sweet. Loved seeing this uber macho prepper guy suddenly trembling like a leaf with how nervous and self-conscious he was."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I never got to say goodbye to my best friend and to my dad when they passed away in 2020. I wish I had spent a proper last day with me just like frank and bill were able to do.  I cried so much.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Early yes, but hard to disagree. As someone that loved the games, the whiplash of expectation to such a radically different approach to show determination and tenderness in this world was exceptionally effective. For those that have experienced the game and are even remotely media literate, it was phenomenal. I cried, I laughed, I cried a whole lot more. I told my wife that ""that episode was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time,"" and she agreed. 

For those coming in fresh, it was a remarkable way to show depth and complexity and motivation. Taking an episode to do this in an emotional and beautiful way is no waste. It does the functional story moving that the game did in a completely different way. 

I get people having their own tastes and their own opinions, but it's hard to think about people upset for deviating from this show being a play through. I did that. I experienced it. I let it take me along for the story and experience once, why wouldn't I allow this different medium to do the same?"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This is when The Last of Us did World War Z better than World War Z.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Man, this was the episode I was most looking forward to/most worried about. I had conflicting feelings on the Bill/Frank stuff in the game. But holy shit was this just one of the most touching, heartbreaking and beautiful queer love stories I’ve seen.

The game was super progressive for even including an overtly gay character but the game kind of makes Bill’s homosexuality into a joke with the discovery of the gay magazine. Hence my complicated feelings on it. This episode knocked it out of the park. It’s so rare to see gay romance depicted in this way, as an aging couple. I think this has a lot to do with the AIDS pandemic and how we lost a massive percentage of a whole generation but seeing a gay couple be able to grow old together was far more moving than I expected it to be. Phenomenal episode imo."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Last time Ive cried this much from a show/movie was Titanic.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This episode made me weep like a child
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"So I can’t find any comments addressing it and I kinda wanna see what you guys think. What exactly is Bills profession before this??? That house is expensive. You can see the Boston skyline in the distance. He has an arsenal that seems like it would cost nearly $50,000 not including ammunition or any of the other doomsday supplies. Maybe his mother left him the house, who knows. My guess is a degree in Engineering. That’s the only way I see someone putting together some town like that. Sure someone could slap some stuff together but realistically would probably end up hurting themselves trying to set all that up."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Everyone go watch Devs, it's the best Nick Offerman role IMO."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"This episode actually gave me a stomach ache— I mean besides the blatant sobbing it just made me ache. I also laughed out loud more than once (all Nick Offerman).
That scene with Bill and Frank when they are sitting in their suits quietly exchanging rings BROKE ME."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Holy sweet goddamn that show rocked me.

I don’t think I’ve ever been moved that much by tv or a movie.

Nick Offerman and Murray Bartlett were unbelievable."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Best thing I’ve watched this year. Loved it.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Throughout the episode I couldn’t place where i had seen the actor who played Frank before. When I found out he was from White Lotus I couldn’t believe it was the same guy. Great actor.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"One of the most intense and surprising things I noticed was how Bill and Frank are likely the only couple on earth to have such a picturesque, ‘romantic’ ending. They lived and experienced the joys of the old, pre-infection world like maybe only a handful left on earth could experience.

Everything outside their utopia is an apocalyptic dystopia. Most people die in horrible ways, or in substandard, poverty-like conditions in the QZs. It would likely be hundreds or thousands of years before what they had would once again become at least somewhat common."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,It made the notebook look like the emoji movie
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I ugly cried with this episode
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,One of the best Episodes I’ve throughly enjoyed because the World building occurred during this time. I do hope if other seasons are commissioned from this franchise… I’ve seen lots of negativity about this and it’s not been enjoyable to read.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Never played the game. Coming in cold. This is one of the greatest (IMHO) episodes of TV that I’ve ever watched. The writing, the acting, the directing. All perfect. So much tension at he start, then the twist, then the gut wrenching ugly man crying at the end. I need to watch it again but I’m not sure that I can take it right now."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Fuck this episode, I watched it for shroom zombies and instead got my 46 year old straight male heart ripped out from under my guts while cried like I haven’t since I was at least 5, not cool with your fancy writing and excellent acting and directing catching me so hard over what was probably less than 30 minutes. Now we never talk about this ever again"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This episode was incredible
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,That damn shutter island/arrival song 😢
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Watching it! That wink when he’s painting 🥲
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Did anybody else think Bill would be alive when Joel arrived? I thought it possible that he would fake dying to relieve frank of the guilt of leaving him alone
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I played the game in 2020 but forgot who Bill and Frank were lol, so I wasn't expecting the episode to go in that direction. I cried like a baby during their last meal. The score was fantastic as well and probably triggered more emotions. Such a beautiful episode all around."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This episode was like a long version of UP's love story. loved it.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"This particular episode had it all: acting, writing, story, pathos. It’s one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. If the quality stays this high it might be the best series ever."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"This episode was so fucking touching I almost cried in front of my folks. I don't like crying in front of people (which is normal), but this brought tears to my eyes."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,[removed]
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,One of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time.  I suspect the right wingers are going to loose their minds.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"What a masterpiece. 

And on episode 3. Going to be hard to compete with that one. Man this is a great show."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"All I can say as a straight white cis guy watching a show about zombies, I never expected to be in literal tears at the end of a gay love story. I pretty much just consume TV for entertainment and while I really enjoy some shows I don't really get to emotionally invested. This episode gave me so many of the feels."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,IMHO the greatest queer love story in television history. I'd totally watch a spin off show of Bill and Frank's domestic adventures in post apocalyptia.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"It was definitely the best episode of tv of 2023 so far. A touching tale, both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I hope that the guest stars get remembered come awards season."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This show is incredibly good. My family was spellbound and quite pleasantly surprised.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This is how you tell good stories. I wonder if the writers of rings of power watched it.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,That really was so good. I was fucking bawling.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I knew Nick Offeman was a great actor but gat dam!
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This show is HBO caliber in the best possible way.  I don’t even like the genre per se and know nothing of the game but when acting and writing is this good I just pop some popcorn and wait until next week impatiently.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,They introduced a gay Ron Swanson and then killed him in one episode.  :-(
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"This was a good ep ill admit. Def carried by the actors. But what bothered me about it, and its been done so many times in other shows is.....Bill, standing there....standing straight up, poppin shots with a BOLT ACTION RIFLE IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Why...just...why do so many shows do this shit. Im to believe this (probably vet), mega prepper gun ""enthusiast"" has no tactical training at all?! That mf'r would be behind cover, dick in the dirt poppin shots from a comfortable distance at his leisure. Not standing straight up in the middle of the fucking road....god i hate that shit, takes me right out. Murray bartlett was incredible tho so...i guess theres that"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Beaujolais Villages.  My family’s go to wine. Never heard anyone ever mention it. I was hooked from then on.  What an awesome episode!  Incredible all around. Well done!
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Incredible episode. The Bill story in the game was good, but they really took it to another level here. I'm happy they're sticking to the game in certain areas, but this was an inspired change. We got a fantastic, emotional story that still imparts the same lesson to Joel and let's us feel his pain over Tess through Bill's experience."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Just watched the episode tonight. Brilliant first few minutes when he meets frank. My wife and I were just WAITING for frank to kill him. Especially when he sat down at the piano... 50m later were both crying at the love story. 

Brilliant story telling. Absolutely loving the series so far. LOF is a top 10 game for me so it's especially awesome to see the carry over. My wife whos never had interest can't stop watching either!"
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,This was a powerful episode. It’s the kind of rare and unexpected storytelling that I’ll remember for a long time.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Ron would be disappointed.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Every now and then, you are watching TV, and you become aware that what you are seeing is far above the level of quality of most TV. This episode was o e of those times. As it ended, I just sat there, stunned. It has been a LONG time since I've seen anything as good as this episode on TV."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Idk I thought it kinda dragged.. I enjoyed the 1st and 2nd episode a lot more
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Waterworks non stop. Finally a gay love story I can rewatch.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I cried. That's it.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I'm sad that they cut Elllies and Joel's scenes with Bill, those are some of the best scenes in the game (including the ""sticky pages"" in the car afterwards.."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,It was good. I was just disappointed that we didn't get the great back and forth exchanges with Bill and Ellie like in the game.
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Maybe an unpopular opinion. First off, I loved the episode. Not saying it wasn’t great. But in the entirety of an hour long episode, in the end Joel and Ellie just get Bill and Frank’s stuff and leave. What’s the point of having that entire backstory and flashback for that?  I’m not criticizing it at all, just a genuine wonder about the screen time spent just to show a small connection to Joel in the past and then him and Ellie just move on."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"I get that anyone who criticises the episode will be labelled as homophobic but seriously though, they decided to waste one of only 9 episodes on that? What the fuck."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"There was such an absurd amount of hype around this episode...

... and, yea, it lived up to it."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,"Man the one thing that really pissed me off about this episode was the raid attack. Why the fuck is Bill standing out in the middle of the street with no cover?

So far the series has been good about these sorts of decision making on the characters parts but Bill is made out to be a survivor yet he makes such a stupid mistake.

Also seems odd to me that they would have had in all that time just one raid? It's clear to see that the town has supplies, it is fortified so there definitely would have been other groups who invade. Especially considering it's close proximity to Boston.

Excellent episode otherwise but yea that just didn't sit well with me. Not sure why Joel and Tess would continue going back to the QZ instead of stake out with Bill and Frank and live a comfortable life when it's clearly less stressful and more ideal.

Felt like a place totally disconnected from the horrors of the world. Needed more emphasis on the constant fight for survival like the games really try to hammer into you.

Still, excellent episode that didn't follow the tropes of most media."
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,Well we just decided the song we want to walk down the aisle to this summer. Thanks zombie apocalypse movie!! And thanks Nick and Murray!
LEGO Bionicle: The Journey to One,I'd argue best episodes of TV ever. I like this show a lot more when there's no zombies.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Mance Rayder!
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Is Rory Kinnear gonna give birth to himself from his Rory Kinussy like in Men cuz if so i need to binge s1 fast.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Can they add an interesting story?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Mance!
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Can they add some new writers?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,That show is dead.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,How wasn't this cancelled
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Just cancel it already
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,how'd this trash get a second session?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Did they add new writers
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Good actors but no thank you.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Yeah, but did they hire any good writers?"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,So the flop continues....
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Are they hiring better writers?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Long haired elves or GTFO
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"I dug this show.  Sorry, my comment is not a pithy negging one-liner."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Yea I’d be cautious attaching my name to that pos.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Rory Kinear will never be the same for me after watching Men. If you've seen it, you know why."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Rory Kinnear was so bloody great in *Penny Dreadful* that the fact he didn’t win an Emmy (or Eva Green) just shows be how worthless award shows are.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,From the thumbnail it looked like Colin Robinson. Was curious the direction they’d be going with energy vampires.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,I think it’s the law that every old times HBO show wit swords and horses has to have hinds in it.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Did they add any new writers
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Great stuff!!
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"It doesn't matter how many great actors they throw at this huge, stinking turd, it's still gonna be a huge, stinking turd!"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Can't have someone in that show doing a half decent Irish accent, so Ciaran can't be a harfoot anywho"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Is the Show good?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Mance effing Rayder
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,so they didn't cancel season 2. why?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"More majestic horse rides, please."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Siiiiigh
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Reddit's obsession with this show continues to blow my mind. Even the people who love it don't care about it as much as the people who hate it.

Don't you all get tired of saying the same thing over and over again?"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"It doesn't matter what they do going forward, after 5 episodes, I couldn't take it anymore."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Who cares about this dogwater show. It doesn't deserve the name LOTR
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Cool. I won’t watch this season, either."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,this show sucks ass they're getting wasted
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Won't change the writing.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Wait. How is there a season 2 after the massive train wreck that season 1 was?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Maybe the story will be better
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Great show, despite what the smoothbrains on reddit think. The visuals and costumes were amazing."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"They could add the entire cast of the original movies and I still wouldn't watch this hot garbage. They ruined it before it even got off the ground with those Tolkien-hating show runners and writers who thought they could actually one-up Tolkien with his own world building and characterizations. Galadriel as presented as the heroic female lead of this crap is not just a pale shadow of what is represented in the books, she's a complete bastardization of her. As to the rest...just crap after crap after crap. I definitely won't be coming around for season 2. When it comes to adapting fantasy ""franchises"" such as this and Wheel of Time, Amazon has no clue what they are doing and neither do the show runners they hire."
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"More diversity castings, whata surprise… just make a portion set in the damn east if you want dark people in lotr, theyre not in the west… the blue wizards could be spotlighted aswell"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,I think I’m the only one on Reddit that genuinely enjoyed the show.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Who cares? Travesty they are going to make another season.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"If they want to throw millions away and see it come back, hire whoever made *the Last Of Us*, they have a good story and a good cast"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,"Well it wasnt exactly better actors this show neede.. Oh well it did, but it needed better writers first and foremost !"
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Still going to be mid though…
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Apparently they can't stop until they ruin the next big cultural mythical franchise. I already feel sorry that such a great actor as Ciaran will waste his energy on that guaranteed train wreck.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Have they hired new writers yet?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,How the fuck did this even get cleared for a season 2?? I want to say 95% of the people that watched this show hated it and ripped on it. I guess they decided to go with the other 5% without a brain and said fuck yeah! tHeY wAnT mOrE
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,How about hiring some writers who aren't complete morons?
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,But will it not be shit? Maybe actually hire show runners that know what they are doing.
LEGO Friends: The Power of Friendship,Man they should stop spending so much money on good actors that will anyone need to work with boring and bad writing and hire better showrunners. You had a diamond and provided a plastic pebble.
Murder Maps,Really enjoyed this show!
Murder Maps,"I wish for this show, that she'd stick the name Martin (Or Martina, or Martinique) into her name for the credits. Not for real life, just to match her costars. ""Selena Martina Gomez.

I really like this show and I'm glad it's getting a second season."
Murder Maps,Highly recommend this show. It's the *Galaxy Quest* of murder mysteries. It cleverly satirizes its genre while also being a top tier example of the actual material. And it has a lot of laughs packed into a relatively short running time.
Murder Maps,"> I’m catching up by phone with Gomez, who is on the set of Season 2 of “Only Murders in the Building,” her hit Hulu series with Steve Martin and Martin Short. (Check out the exclusive selfie that Gomez sent me above!) The three play neighbors who try to solve a murder in their Upper West Side apartment building. “It’s cool because personally in my life, since I started Season 1 to doing Season 2, I changed so much,” Gomez says. “I know that it’s a small amount of time, but I think it kind of carried on into [her character] Mabel. If anything, there’s just more of a sophistication to her. Her style gets better. She’s like super cool. I cut my hair. So it’s a whole fresh start for Mabel.”


> Gomez says series co-creator John Hoffman started mapping ideas out for Season 2 toward the end of filming the first season, which wrapped with Mabel leaning over another dead body before being arrested along with Charles (Martin) and Oliver (Short). “Another season was casually thrown around but then John started spewing these ideas out and sure enough they have come into fruition,” Gomez says. “When I was reading it, I was really really shocked because this is so different but it’s what makes the show so great. They did such a great job creating another story.”"
Murder Maps,I really enjoyed season one and am looking forward to more.
Murder Maps,This is a really fun show.
Murder Maps,This is a great show and I feel she holds her own with these 2 comedy legends. Looking forward to season 2.
Murder Maps,Loved the show but I find her acting blah at best.
Murder Maps,That show is bomb!!
Murder Maps,Have to complain that I really loved this show up until the very end scene of the last episode. Like it was stapled on at the last second just to justify a second season. Of course I'll watch it but not because I'm hanging on in suspense of this ludicrous plot twist.
Murder Maps,Selena is so beautiful
Murder Maps,As s long time Steve Martin and Martin Short fan I absolutely LOVED watching a show with them that I was able to forgive Selena’s terrible acting. But everyone starts somewhere so let’s hope season 2 she learns more!
Murder Maps,"I sure hope they had the blueprint for season 2 mapped out at the same time as they wrote season 1.

When your show is for, by and about an audience of true crime aficionados who like to investigate and scrutinise plot holes… that puts a lot of pressure on the writers!"
Murder Maps,"QUESTION!......i started to watch this show and i'm enjoying a lot thus far (i'm on episode 3).  does this season end on an unfinished cliffhanger type of deal or are things mostly (or completely) wrapped up at least regarding the building's murders?  

any info on this is appreciated!"
Murder Maps,"Without my glasses on, I thought these were her parents"
Murder Maps,"Looking forward to a Brazzos spin-off, myself."
Murder Maps,[deleted]
Murder Maps,I literally thought Martin shirt was an older woman
Murder Maps,So when do the Gomez haters get here?
Murder Maps,"Really fun show but I gotta say I didn’t really care for the ending, and especially not the surprise cliffhanger. I don’t see how S2 can be anything but extremely contrived."
Murder Maps,Currently on episode 5. Amazing acting from all three (no surprise) and a captivating story!
Murder Maps,Yay!  Season 2!
Murder Maps,"Honestly,  this was one of the best shows I've watched this year 

Really hoping they can keep the quality up"
Murder Maps,"At first I didn't expect to enjoy it that much, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise."
Murder Maps,[deleted]
Murder Maps,"I was hoping she’d start going by “Short”, so it could be Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Short Selena."
Murder Maps,Martin Short needs more recognition as one of the all time greats. He’s really the perfect glue guy between Selena Gomez and Steve Martin.
Murder Maps,Shesh that’s pretty high fucking praise
Murder Maps,"I agree.  I couldn’t get over that it seems she talks without opening her mouth.  She did well with the part, but wouldn’t say she is an amazing actress."
Murder Maps,It was also literally the first scene of the first episode though too so it wasn't completely tacked on.
Murder Maps,did you even read the title of this post?
Murder Maps,the main things of S1 are solved
Murder Maps,The murders are wrapped. It ends on a cliffhanger but that's to set up a new storyline.
Murder Maps,Demi Lovato.
Murder Maps,"Are you as impressed with Selena Gomez as I was? I mean, that Martin Short and Steve Martin do their thing was to be expected, but I did not think that Gomez would blow me away the way she did. I can't really put my finger on it either. She was just really....good."
Murder Maps,"Like most shows for me, it takes a few eps."
Murder Maps,Does it get better after the pilot? It felt way too cutesy for me.
Murder Maps,"“Hey guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?”


That’s not a dig at you, I think maybe I’ve gotten to the age where I thought everyone was familiar with the major Hitchcock movies. With Rear Window being easily top 5 if not top 3 Hitchcock movies. Psycho and The Birds are top 3 no doubt but North by Northwest and Vertigo are both iconic as well. 


And if your not familiar with these then get off my lawn and go stream you some slow paced black and white suspense movies. You’ll get so many references in other pop culture you never noticed before."
Murder Maps,"> I recommend it to anyone who liked Murders in the Building.

I'd recommend Rear Window to anyone who likes movies, or art, or is alive."
Murder Maps,Rear Window is not some obscure film lol it's a seminal picture made by a seminal and extremely famous director.
Murder Maps,"She has lupus which from what I've heard can make you hurt everytime you move your jaw, which explains why her mouth moves so little."
Murder Maps,I think it was absolutely tacked on and bookended for continuity. It makes no sense to me in any other context. Just my opinion.
Murder Maps,"I have read it, but I don’t think ideas necessarily mean the core skeleton of the story. More like guest stars, scenes, set pieces etc.."
Murder Maps,cool! thanx theyusedthelamppost!
Murder Maps,"thanx godisanelecticolive!

:)"
Murder Maps,I thought the same thing. Didn’t expect to be a Selena Gomez fan.
Murder Maps,I thought her acting was the weakest part of the show.
Murder Maps,Not really. I thought her acting was pretty poor at times.
Murder Maps,"I strongly disagree.  Her acting was the most disappointing part of the whole show for me.  I could hardly stand to watch her robotically recite her lines.  I did thoroughly enjoy the acting from all the other actors, even the side characters like the board president and the dude with the cat"
Murder Maps,Believe in yourself. She just might one day.
Murder Maps,"I gave it several episodes before I gave up; I wanted to like it but in the end the writing just didn't work for me.

I'm not one to balk at coarse language (my comment history will confirm it), but man it just felt like they're cussing all the time just because they can on Hulu. It felt so unnatural and forced, like a kid who cusses a lot when the parents aren't around because he can, but doesn't really get *how* to cuss in a natural way.

That was the most noticeable thing that kept bumping me out of it, but in general it just felt like the type of thing made by people who've absorbed a lot of good writing and filmmaking concepts but didn't really know how to use them to create something that added up to more than just the sum of its parts. I stopped watching mid-ep 5, iirc.

It's a shame though because I did enjoy the actors' performances. The writing, and to a lesser extent the directing, just didn't do them justice."
Murder Maps,"Yeah I didn't react immediately and I was like ""oh it's interesting"" and then the Hitchcock name and I was like ""wait does he speak about this Rear Window? One of the most known movies ever lol"""
Murder Maps,[deleted]
Murder Maps,... one that probably 98% of the US hasn't seen
Murder Maps,"I think she was a nice balance, she was the grounded character where Steven Martin and Martin Short are very large/bold characters- that was my impression if that makes sense anyways. I have never seen her in anything before so I didn’t know what to expect but I wasn’t disappointed"
Murder Maps,"Yes, she was way toned down. Again, maybe I give her credit where none was due. I was confused by it as well since I had her in a very different category..."

Murder Maps,"It wasn’t a dig buddy no worries. It was a reference to Civil War where Spider-Man makes everybody feel old. If anything I compared you to Spider-Man in this instance and you could definitely take that as a compliment.

Just watch what strikes your fancy and don’t let us old folks try to convince you otherwise. Take a recommendation under consideration but don’t ever feel obligated to watch it. Some people won’t enjoy any black and white movie no matter how well done and that’s ok."
Murder Maps,Different strokes for different folks. It certainly does have a lot going for it so I see why people would have fun with it. It just wasn't for me.
Murder Maps,High praise.
Murder Maps,Netflix has had some absolutely amazing kid shows. I dont know why they haven't done more to push these shows.
Murder Maps,"I worked on this show and it was the best fun I've had on a project. I'd watch all the episodes in storyboard form as soon as they were delivered and my wife and I binged it the moment it was released (a full year after animation wrapped mind you).

The interactive map sounded cool when I heard about it and I was blown away by the art and animation (done by a separate team in Singapore). In practice though it was just a clunky pain in the arse and most people I told to watch it reported problems. Some couldn't watch it at all. 

I really thought it would break through but IMO netflix buried it in the kids section. Amongst so many try-hard adult oriented cartoons battle kitty had real heart. Such a shame.

Glad you enjoyed it though."
Murder Maps,That’s up to the kids to decide
Murder Maps,I’m willing to say it’s in the same category of peak Cartoon Network with Adventure Time and Regular Show. It’s that freaking good.
Murder Maps,"This is a hill I'm willing to die on. Especially because ""Band Geeks"" from Spongebob is one of the better episodes in all of Television"
Murder Maps,"I agree with you. It's interesting cause some of them aren't even truly ""Kids shows"", it's just how they're categorized. Like this one tailors itself to a younger audience but my partner and I love it"
Murder Maps,"Any chance of getting a s2?! 

I never experiences any problems with the interactive map though I do feel it made episode selection sometimes a bit more tedious. That said, the story and writing were so incredible that it made any issues seem mute. I desperately hope for another season as I got to the end and just craved more!

Thanks for your work on it and it shows clearly you all cared about making something both good and fun!"
Murder Maps,Thanks I appreciate it. As far as season 2 goes I lean towards probably not. Netflix is a bit of a black box so it's hard to tell but based on the lack of online buzz it didn't take off. Only possibility is if the creators can take it to another production house. You could always tweet at Matt Layzell and ask him haha
Murder Maps,"Great explanation of the time lines! Gonna show this to my folks who are watching, but are mildly confused. 

However, you missed one of my favorite (small) details: 

Ciri and Geralt’s destinies are so intertwined that the farmer Geralt saved from ghouls actually offers him the Law of Surprise as payment. Geralt immediately refuses, but had he accepted,  Ciri would have once again been his reward.  She was what the farmer had waiting for him at home, but did not know."
Murder Maps,"I'm Confused. I've play the games and read about the books, always believed Gerald white hair was due to a more advanced set of trials rarely given to any witcher."
Murder Maps,"Thanks for the write up of especially the pre story lore of the world as I didn’t get all of that from the snippets of dialogue in the show.  

I do have a question, what is the valley of plenty?"
Murder Maps,">  Geralt saves Yen by wishing for their fates to be bound together.

Do we know what he wished for?"
Murder Maps,[deleted]
Murder Maps,"I think you misrepresented nilfgaard a bit, in a lot of ways they are better than the north for being more advanced and not racist, however Nilfgaard does employ slave labour, slaves that are usually supplied via the wars of agression they fight, and their ""manifest destiny"" of conquering the entire continent doesn't come with just a desire for unification, but with genocide and atrocities that are pretty fucking terrible, if they don't kill people they displace them and bring in colonists from nilfgaard instead, and in Nilfgaard you get hanged by the tiniest of offenses, like speaking ill of the imperator, whereas in the northen kingdoms criticism of the kings and queens is pretty common."
Murder Maps,"As someone who had no prior knowledge of the Witcher (other than that it existed), I felt the show did quite well in explaining itself.  It usually takes me awhile to catch on so no surprise that I didn't realize 3 seperate timelines until ep5.

That said I didn't know everything you wrote, so it's a nice little background but not entirely necessary to keep up with the show and understand what was happening.

Still, thank you for this."
Murder Maps,"I do wish they had added a little more fun between Geralt and Jaskier. The sho presents Jaskier as an eternal pain in the ass, and it feels like Geralt just basically dislikes him. Hard to fit all that into a single season, but the way they presented it feels forced."
Murder Maps,"Thank you so much for this. As someone new to the world, I did not find the series confusing, but I am very grateful for your short description of the background of the world. The whole Conjunction was mentioned in the show, but was not really explained. Really interesting to read about. 

I do have a few questions

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard, although since the protagonists are part of the small minority that wouldn’t be better off (rulers, sorceresses, witchers), they don’t see it that way. 

I am happy to read this. I actually found myself cheering for Nilfgaard in the final battle. I could not figure out if the show intentionally wanted us to see good and bad on both sides, or if the show just failed in giving me any sympathy for the North. 

Sure, Nilfgaard was portrayed as pretty bad in some areas, but the whole ""Defend our way of life in the North"" that the Brotherhood kept talking about did not convince me. Their way of life is to turn innocent girls into eels and to kill baby girls who were born at the wrong time... 

Are we supposed to see the North as the good guys and cheer for them? Or is it on purpose that the show is hinting towards Nilfgaard not being the worst side? 

Also, I was confused why Yennefer joined the battle for the Brotherhood. During the whole series she has seemed mostly focused on herself and on achieving beauty, power etc. It seemed that it came down to Tissaia saying something like ""Do it for me"". But I really do not feel the show succeeded in showing any kind of friendship or loyalty between Yenn and Tiss."
Murder Maps,"To give you some more history about the politics of the Witcher, you need to understand the history of Poland.

Poland, itself, is a country of iterations. Going back from when people bothered recording history we see that the slavic regions have been a stopping off point for many nomadic peoples, from the goths to the Burgundy to the  Tatars, to Mongolians and Germans, and vikings and jews. No one peoples have a claim to the idea of an ethnic pure poland, as poland itself is extremely diverse set of peoples. This is analogous to the Conjunction of the Spheres, as the Elves weren't the first people in the land of the Witcher, and neither were the Dwarves, gnomes are the oldest known ""civilized"" creature in the Witcher World, but that doesn't even take into account the other ""monsters"". In this sense, the amount of monsters and different elder races and humanity living together represent the messy living situation that is the polish ethnic makeup, and how at times it can be peaceful with lots of harmony, and incredibly violent. 

Now; the Nilfgaard vs Northern Realms is something analogous so what happened in more recent history; In World War 2, Poland was being carved up by the two world superpower. The Ethnic cleansing warmongering Fascist-feudalist state that was Nazi Germany (Northern Kingdoms), and the technologically advancing mega-empire with more money and manpower than sense in the Soviet Union (Nilfgaard). Nilfgaard (Soviets) were kinder to the Elder Races (Gypsies) than the Northern Kingdoms (Nazis), so they felt that it was fight or die, while the Northern Kingdoms wanted an ethnically pure realm by ghettoizing and displacing as any of the Elderblood as possible for ""The safety of and prosperity of the Kingdom"".

This dichotomy is what leads us to the Anti-politics Geralt, who represents the post-soviet attitude of Poland that is Neo-Liberalism, the idea of free movement and a more tolerant society for the purpose of ensuring a more free, less oppressed, and more resilient Polish republic."
Murder Maps,[deleted]
Murder Maps,"They should have played the opening animated intro (not the CG) to Witcher 3. Briefly explains magic, the conjunction, witchers, people's attitude toward both, and touched on the wild hunt.

Murder Maps,[removed]
Murder Maps,"One thing I would add is that the farmer Gerlalt saved offered him the law of surprise as payment for saving his life.  The reward would then be Ciri who his daughter was taking in as a new daughter and, thus, his new granddaughter.   This further reinforces the destiny between Geralt and Ciri."
Murder Maps,"Good write-up! Although I disagree with the decision to jump around the timelines so much, they do try and drop a few hints here and there that let you figure it out. I think the first one is when they talk about an old battle that Calanthe won, and a few scenes later we hear that she's just won it. There's also stuff like Foltest as an adult king vs. seeing him as a child. You can definitely reconstruct the timelines based on the hints, but it's really hard to do on the fly as you're trying to watch the show."
Murder Maps,"Omg, you linked my version of the Witcher map!"
Murder Maps,"Thank you so much for this.  I am enjoying the snow but have been relatively lost.  I don't consider myself a total idiot, either (though that's certainly a matter of opinion).  I was just thinking to myself that this show is likely much better understood by those who are already familiar with it."
Murder Maps,"This is very well written, but I feel like the show generally explains things pretty plainly in exposition if you just pay attention."
Murder Maps,"I never read the books or played the games, but I did still pick up on most of that stuff. However, the one thing I didn't pick up on at all is that Nilfgaard isn't actually the bad guys. 

The army clad in black armor surely had to be the horrible people. It is pretty much the trope of all movies/shows that the people in black attire are the bad guys. 

As I watched though, they never really seemed that bad. I just figured they hadn't expressed their true intentions yet. So, the whole time I was just thinking; ""what are they up to?"""
Murder Maps,"If Nilfgaard is this advanced civilization, why does it have a leave nobody alive policy during war?  It instantly makes them look like the bad guys and somewhere else in this post it says Nilfgaard uses slaves so it’s be counterintuitive to kill everyone.  Does this have something to do specifically with Cintra or do Cintrans just think Nilfgaard is like that because they tend to dehumanize the south?"
Murder Maps,"This is going to get me downvoted, but I don’t care. Evidently there’s something fundamentally flawed about your storytelling when fans have to write a 20+ paragraph explanation as to what’s going on. 

It’s one of my major gripes about the show - your average Netflix dude/lady isn’t going to understand the world—isn’t given enough information to—and likely isn’t going to deep dive the internet for information if they see a show that jumps around timelines and assumes you already know characters. My friends couldn’t get into it for this reason.

I like the show and hope it improves but this shouldn’t be the norm."
Murder Maps,"It’s a shame the show needs the fans to fill in everything the show runners failed to accomplish themselves. Cavill is great, but they need to replace the writing/production team. The costumes, dialog, and soundstage feel aren’t up to snuff in 2020.

I’m worried it’s not going to get a third season with drop off of non-Witcher fans."
Murder Maps,"If I need to read paragraphs of explanation to understand the show, did the writers do a good enough job of world building? I understand they’re not holding our hand, so to speak, but neither did GoT and it was understandable."
Murder Maps,"Great effort, mate. Appreciated"
Murder Maps,"The endless circlejerking for this show is so tiring now.

Saying shit like ""this show doesnt hold hands"" is some serious rick and morty level defending to excuse some pretty sub par writing/direction.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the witcher."
Murder Maps,"I rewatched it again and realized that time doesn't go back and forth. It's consistent, but it jumps for one character to catch up to the other.

Geralt starts when his legend began. Blaviken.

Yennifer starts when her legend began. The Lodge of Sorcerers.

Ciri's starts when her legend began. The Cintra massacre.

The stories don't interwove into each other yet. They show their exploits and experiences first. Time is going forward but at different points. They merge together at the end."
Murder Maps,This is a great primer but you shouldn’t have to know all this to enjoy a TV show. It was a jumbled mess and I doubt I’ll watch season 2.
Murder Maps,"I'm late to the game, so this will probably go unnoticed, but I'd still like to show my appreciation for this post.

My biggest complaint about the show - for someone unfamiliar with the Witcher - was how we did have no notion at all how the world worked. There is no timeframe, no location, things just happen. It felt like a small world, because I had no idea what the larger scope was.

The plot felt so convoluted and I really feel they could have used your writing on the show. 
Words like ""meanwhile"", ""northern"", etc.. can give us more information about a larger world while keeping the story focused in a monster-of-the-week routine while we follow Geralt.
Including a map would work too, exactly how you did, because it can make for much better understanding.
Great fantasy shows like ""GoT"" or ""Avatar: the Last Airbender"" even feature their map in their openings, because they know they are important for worldbuilding.

All in all, I did think it was an average to subpar fantasy show when you consider the above. This post made a lot things more clear, which I believe shouldn't have. Since a good story is clear on itself."
Murder Maps,"Okay, this summary made way more sense than the show itself did."
Murder Maps,"> In Nilfgaard, elves and dwarves are treated as full citizens 

Nope, that's fanfiction. Nilfgaard's internal racial relations are never addressed. Over the course of the books, we meet only 2 elves (and not a single dwarf) in the South, so it's possible they simply do not have any significant population of elves and dwarves. 

> There’s frankly a pretty good case to be made that the citizens of the north would be better off if conquered by Nilfgaard 

Again, fanfiction (aka Witcher 3). They would be dead or enslaved, since Nilfgaard's goal is to replace Nordlings with their own settlers to achieve Lebensraum (a living space). As a state, they have very little redeeming qualities. Individual Nilfgaardian characters can be nice though."
Murder Maps,"As a person who first played the games in their release-order and who read most of the books I didn't find the timeline too hard to follow or separate after the third or so episode, and my girlfriend who watched it with me and who never played the games before also caught on to it quickly without needing my help with explaining anything.

And as much as it can be a bit confusing for the first episode or two I actually really appreciate how the story was structured since it really puts the differnce in life-span between Sorcerors/Sorceresses, Witchers and humans as a whole into sharp contrast.

While Gerald and Yennefer is effectively just dicking their way through the decades a teenage-queen becomes a mom, a granny and eventually see her kingdom razed to the ground."
Darker Than Black,"I just recently saw DtB at the recommendation of a friend, the only anime I've seen in awhile, and it was brilliant. I wish they would make more of it, but barring that I think Netflix would do a great job for sure!"
Darker Than Black,"For me, it was Tuesday."
Darker Than Black,Jenna Ortega has found a niche
Darker Than Black,"I’ve seen like 3 positive reviews immediately on front page but when I actually check out an aggregate score it’s the definition of mediocre https://www.metacritic.com/tv/wednesday/season-1

How many of the posters in /r/television and /r/entertainment are bots/shills for Netflix and Amazon?"
Darker Than Black,"""various shades of black and gray"" i like this kind of humor, now it will be great to find if is from the series or the writter."
Darker Than Black,I’m trying to like it but I’m struggling.
Darker Than Black,"It was seriously amazing from start to finish. I mean i wish that they did a more practical effect for the Hyde creature and I kind of figured out who was behind it from episode 2 but other then that seriously a great watch. Casting Jenna Ortega was a huge blessing to the show. I love how they wrote for Wednesday to be standoffish and keep that throughout the show while giving Wednesday layers of depth to show her evolving(she even said it in the later episodes at one point) And Jenna really let those layers shine even if they were subtle hints of Wednesday embracing having help and people who cared about her. The pacing of each episode was perfect and at no point did I feel like there was any slog or unecessary filler to drag the episodes. While I dont think that everyome was perfectly casted, I feel that each actor gave their own spin to the character they were portraying, but Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester was a bit of an odder choice imo then peoples problem with Luis Guzman as Gomez imo. Despite me figuring out who the villians were early, I really did like the setup and how misdiretions were set up to throw the viewer off. I am writing an anime graphic novella in a similar vein to Wednesday (I wrote this back in 2012 before I saw the show.) And it gave me great ideas on fixing my own plot pacing and character development. I wish would netflix greenlight more great bangers like this show because this might actually be the one standout netflix exclusive for 2022 for binging. Whoever is on the fence about this because you have reservations due to the casting of certain actors or your devote love for the older Addams Family movie counterpart I urge you to give this a chance. Tim Burton helming the show and it not being a PG rated generic ABC Family type of garbage really gave this show the edge to have what already is a unique identity, I highly recommend watching this. On a last note, casting Christina Ricci in this and her interacting with Wednesday and even saying her name was so cool."
Darker Than Black,"I dont know, watching the trailer it reminds me of scooby doo cartoon series when they joined the monster girl school.

Darker Than Black,Struggles with addiction? He left the show right around when he was accused of anally raping his college girlfriend with a beer bottle. That and nobody on the show liked him
Darker Than Black,"TBF, T.J. Miller's character was played out with zero development, kinda like every other character."
Darker Than Black,"Miller's sociopathic tendencies probably didn't help. As soon as he finds a person agreeable and compatible for friendship he starts insulting and humiliating them, to distance himself from anyone potentially able to get under his guard. I think it's even mentioned on his wiki."
Darker Than Black,So they copied Dragon Ball Z.

No new laws have passed, as the tech industry largely self regulates still. Jeff Bezos made 80 BILLION since 2014. Lets not pretend this industry or the titans running it are being held accountable"

The third episode though, I loved.  It was hilarious.  The farcical treatment of the LoD, Dr. Psycho and the word 'cunt', Maxie Zeus, Clayface ... hilarious.

And while I'd normally expect to be on 'team Harley', she's still a dangerously crazy villain.  In a turn that probably surprises nobody, I find Ivy to be the sympathetic character of the show.  Quinn might have her name on the marquee, but Ivy's the one I am starting to care about and want to see turn out 'OK'.  I think it helps that we not only don't see her seducing and poisoning people, but in fact we see her going out of her way to save the kids that were accidentally poisoned even as they're perving on her."
Dr. Psycho,How is this show? I saw that one clip when the show began where I think Harley attacks people on a boat. It seemed a bit too excited about being allowed to curse.
Dr. Psycho,Getting some Venture Brothers vibes from this.
Dr. Psycho,This show has a wonderfully dark sense of humor
Dr. Psycho,"I haven't seen the show, but based on the video Harley seems a little too sane and put together here, no? I find portrayals of her are typically pretty ditsy while also almost as insane as Joker, but here she seems more intelligent and cunning. Guess she learned from Mr. J."
Dr. Psycho,"Do they have some requirement for number of f-bombs per minute? Every clip I see of this show ruins it by forcing in as many ""fucks"" as they can."
Dr. Psycho,"It will be interesting to see how this compares to the ""Harley Quinn featuring the Birds of Prey"" movie. I love Harley in this series, but the movie looks so toned down and off character."
Dr. Psycho,"I've NEVER seen as many videos about any show on this sub

Something is up here 🤔"
Dr. Psycho,I wish they'd put more full episodes on YouTube because I saw the first episode there through VPN and absolutely loved it. I need to see more.
Dr. Psycho,I've now seen 5 clips from this show and everyone is more try hard then the last. Super cringe.

Dr. Psycho,"It’s funny because Ivy’s plant Frank ate a kid and his family while Ivy was in Arkham, so it’s nice she at least has a higher moral standard her pet plant."
Dr. Psycho,"The next episodes are better than the pilot / Episode 1.  They have more humor that pokes fun of the DC universe in general, whether it be Penguin hosting a bar mitzvah or Dr. Psycho getting (and failing) at a PR stint after calling Wonder Woman the c-word."
Dr. Psycho,"It still gives you that feeling at times, that it's trying too hard to be for adults. That being said, I've enjoyed it a lot and can't wait to see more"
Dr. Psycho,The show is stupid and shouldn't work yet I find myself enjoying it way too much anyway
Dr. Psycho,"Feels like they did that strong on the first episode, but episodes 2 and 3 tone that down to a reasonable level."
Dr. Psycho,I love it.  Its goofy as hell and pretty funny.
Dr. Psycho,I've enjoyed watching it stoned
Dr. Psycho,"Its like Venture Brothers if they had executive overlords and not as good writers.  
  
Edit : I don't mean this as a negative.  Nobody has writers like Venture Brothers.  They are the top of the bar as far as I am concerned."

Episode 2 and 3 are much better."

Dr. Psycho,It's a funny show and people like it.  Nothing sinister.
Dr. Psycho,Really? I've only seen this one.
Dr. Psycho,But if they did that how would they fund the show? That animation looks more expensive than I think AdSense could provide.
Dr. Psycho,Fuck that Wonder Woman bit actually sounds funny
Dr. Psycho,"I love the VB’s knack for remembering continuity.  They referenced stuff in their latest season that was first mentioned in the earlier seasons.  The world building is also hilarious as well.

What I think is the strength of Harley Quinn is the fact they have the whole DC universe to use, whether it be the serious or silly elements from the comics or other sources of media."
Dr. Psycho,"All hail the Arbiter of Dark Humor, Malephic. He has not looked fondly upon this television program and therefore it must be shut down."
Dr. Psycho,But what if though? 🤔
Dr. Psycho,"Thanks! I'll take that as a compliment

Getting all sorts of nice comments today 😊

Must be the Christmas spirit. Either that or some of you stinking cunts have opened a window and let some fresh air in"
Dr. Psycho,Mmmmm hmmmm 🤔
Dr. Psycho,"This is like the 7th time I've seen a clip posted on here in the last few weeks and it usually ends with ""This show is awesome!"" or something along those lines. Smacks of promotion as I don't see other shows getting the same treatment to this extent 

It's just suspicious in my opinion"

The sub has 16 million subscribers, it's a new show, 7 out of 16 million people made posts about it because they like it. Take off your tin foil hat ffs."
Dr. Psycho,Uhh no Aquaman is very much in the show
Dr. Psycho,Oh yeah.  I kind of wonder what they did to cause the cut-off...

Dr. Psycho,Shouldn't your mother be handling that?
Dr. Psycho,"Calm down and go for a walk bro

You're scaring me with this shit"
Dr. Psycho,"They claim they just pushed his movie personality to 11.  But thats not why DC said no.  They said no because that's a billion dollar franchise and they can't have that.  I've also noticed they are only really poking fun of the bat villains but not Joker, Harley or Batman. So even though they offically have come out and said they were told no on Aquaman, I would assume the same went for Wonder Woman, Batman, Superman, Harley and Joker."
Dr. Psycho,Lol you're the one throwing a conspiracy theory hissy fit
Dr. Psycho,"Well, Batman is the straight man and he is voiced by one of the campiest (in my opinion, coolest) Batmen in animation.

Joker is also mocked a lot in the show as well for being very petty, but he is the antagonist overall.  Harley is also the butt of a lot of jokes in the show due to her “Joker’s girlfriend” status."
Dr. Psycho,"> They said no because that's a billion dollar franchise and they can't have that. 

This logic fails to hold up considering that in this very episode they had a villain call Wonder Woman a cunt."
Dr. Psycho,"Im being entirely serious and always was of course 😊😘

How was your walk?"
Dr. Psycho,Calling them a name isn't making fun of the character.
Dr. Psycho,"Then again she isn’t a billion dollar franchise yet. But joke aside, I can see why DC let them do it since the villain was punished heavily for it, nobody sympathized with him and Wonder Woman wasn’t the butt of the joke, whereas I guarantee you Aquaman was the butt of the joke before he got cut."
Dr. Psycho,You're a weird dude
Dr. Psycho,"And you're an angry one

Might need another walk by the looks of it"
Dr. Psycho,You ought to xposts to /r/halloween
Dr. Psycho,"This is a pretty amazing lineup. This is the kind of stuff that got me into horror growing up. I'd stay up all night watching classic horror movies and twilight zone and stuff. A lot of Vincent Price in there, my favorite. "
Dr. Psycho,"Thanks, OP! "
Dr. Psycho,"I really, really need to watch some more old horror films. Only seen a few of these."
Dr. Psycho,Wonder how much can hold on my DVR
Dr. Psycho,No House/Hausu?
Dr. Psycho,"Universal, Val Lewton RKO, Hammer, and Japanese horror movies - a glorious line up."
Dr. Psycho,I love it but Poltergeist seems a little out of place here. 
Dr. Psycho,I can't recommend 'Dr. Caligari' enough. It's one of the most unsettling film I've ever seen.
Dr. Psycho,Plus they will also be available through the TCM app!
Dr. Psycho,Thanks OP! I love when they do these.
Dr. Psycho,Oh man I can't wait! I've been dying to see Ugetsu but I've been too cheap to buy it on the criterion collection. 
Dr. Psycho,"Well, I know what channel is gonna be playing at my house all month long. Awesome."
Dr. Psycho,Why air 'Willard' & 'Ben' only once and at 2 AM and 3:45 AM?
Dr. Psycho,"Thanks for the info, OP
  
This is the good stuff right here. The classic horror movies set the perfect mood. AMC use to show all these around Halloween time, but some years ago they shifted to the Slasher type films, and I just don't find those as entertaining for Halloween"
Dr. Psycho,Makes me wish I was unemployed.

Dr. Psycho,"I posted (not crossposted, as it wasn't on my approved beta listing). Thanks for the suggestion."
Dr. Psycho,You're (all) quite welcome.
Dr. Psycho,I love old horror. Definitely gonna use this list to find some new favorites.
Dr. Psycho,"A few of the past handful of Halloweens, I've been unable to watch as much as I would have liked (life crap got in the way). So I DVR'd the whole macabre lineup to watch during the dead of winter (when I'm usually snowed/iced up to my eyeballs.) Believe me, if one's DVR is relatively empty at the outset, one can record just about the whole month's worth."
Dr. Psycho,"That has aired during the previous two Octobers (as well as a bunch of times as a (true) ""b""-flick during the cult-movie double-feature showcase TCM Underground.)

I guess they have figured that they have played it enough."
Dr. Psycho,You're (all) very welcome.
Dr. Psycho,"I'm just the messenger, man. If I had been (one of) the programmer(s), the lineup would have looked (a little) different.

Most would have stayed the same.  However, I would have tried my best to have found room for a giallo (perhaps Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace"" [which did air last October]).  And something Italian Gothic [probably starring Barbara Steele] (perhaps ""The Long Hair of Death"" or ""Castle Of Blood"".)  And almost certainly something from the Corman/Price Poe cycle (probably ""The Masque Of The Red Death"" but also possibly the stealth H.P. Lovecraft adaptation ""The Haunted Castle."")

I'm not kvetching too loudly, though. In the main, I'm content with what's there."

Yeah, it is. I've been ""lurking"" and inwardly going ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" (at the creativity) since you (so kindly) directed me toward it.

And yeah, that book is bloody amazing!! (In fact, I do believe I may have worded it thus.)

"
Dr. Psycho,"I've definitely thought about buying that more than once when the Criterion Collection was having a sale. I think I ended up getting Kwaidan instead, but still haven't watched either yet and I'm eager to do so."
Dr. Psycho,"I liked the pilot. I mean, sure, pretty much all of your points are true - especially the acting of the boy when he was supposed to be sad, it really was terrible - but I think the plot and the directing, cinematography etc. can make up for that, at least a little bit.

Also, I'd never truly judge a show by its pilot. I don't know why, but for a lot of the shows I like, the pilots were pretty lame, so I think you should just watch a couple more episodes."
Dr. Psycho,"An important distinction here: despite the marketing label, this is not a true ""Netflix Original Show"" in the same way shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black are. This is one of those shows that Netflix purchased the simultaneous domestic distribution rights to (and/or in some way helped fund), and part of the agreement lets them market the show as one of their own (not sure why they would want to in this case). But it isn't actually developed internally at Netflix, and the general mark of quality one can apply to Netflix shows isn't really applicable here."
Black Bullet,"Man you are in for a ride.  **The Wire** was an overlooked (for it's time) masterpiece.  I'm not a cop, nor anywhere near law enforcement, but I believe people when they say it's the most realistic police show ever made.

Fun fact.  A police officer fires his gun exactly 3 times during the entire run of **The Wire.** and all 3 times are fuckups by Prez.

Just don't be turned off by the sudden tonal change in season 2.  I loved all of it, but a lot of people think 2 is too slow.  You just have to remember that each season of **The Wire** tackles a different issue with the drug trade in Baltimore."
Black Bullet,I don't see how Mad Men comes off as pretentious nonsense at all.

Black Bullet,"My favourite show of all time, and it's not even close. Television doesnt get better than season 4."
Black Bullet,"The Wire is definitely the GOAT TV show for me. It hit some pretty high peaks. 

YouTube is onto me cause it keeps suggesting Wire scenes and I keep on watching them. 

Season 2 is great. Disregard those who say it's the worst season (which is 5). 

I got the seasons as 4>3>1>2<5"
Black Bullet,I think *The Shield* and *The Wire* are top notch shows.
Black Bullet,"On a somewhat related question, is ""a police"" a Baltimore thing, or is it said in other areas as well. I have never heard ""police"" referring to a singular person before."
Black Bullet,"My favourite TV show of all time. Brilliant characters, McNulty, Bunk, Prez, Prop Joe,  and the GOAT, Omar."
Black Bullet,"**Warning!!!!!:** 

* you're going to be so sad when you finish it. Then you're going going to reminisce and cry when you see some of the actors on different shows. You see some characters go through so much that you become attached to them. 

* avoid any internet discussions on episodes and characters because trust me you don't want to be spoiled. it totally ruins the fun of enjoying things knowing the outcome of certain things.

* you might start looking at politics and police force in the different way. Because some of the things that happen could very well be happening in real life."
Black Bullet,"Just did 4th rewatch recently. So fucking good.

My 2nd favorite show ever."
Black Bullet,Fun Fact. The actress who plays the lesbian cop was just arrested for meth!
Black Bullet,Come join us in r/TheWire but be warned that spoilers typically aren't marked as such.
Black Bullet,The character development is the best part. There are some arcs that will crush you and a few that will spark hope.
Black Bullet,"So, *so* good."
Black Bullet,"I know people say it’s the best show of all time and I’m really really trying to get into it , but I can’t get into watching a “modern times” based show where they use typewriters lol"
Black Bullet,The wire is probably the most important part of television history
Black Bullet,"Be prepared for season 2. I think a lot of people don't like it because they enjoyed season 1 so much and then suddenly feel like they're watching a different show. My theory is that if you know that change is coming, it won't turn you off as much. So just know that S2 will be different, but still very much worth your time."
Black Bullet,"> This show was also quite ahead of it's time in terms of diversity with having several black characters in high-ranking positions of authority 

Um...*go to Baltimore* and take a look at who's been in government, police, etc. It wasn't the show being 'ahead of its time', ffs.

Hey, you love one of my favorite shows and you got hooked (as I did) in the first episode, so you're clearly a person of good character and intelligence, but that doesn't get you off the hook for that silly take-away.

> this is the first time in a TV show where i've seen a cop not be 100% anti-drug

Oh my, do you have something awesome coming in the third season."
Black Bullet,"I'm glad you're enjoying it. I would say to stick with it because if you watch all 5 seasons I think you'll enjoy it. It gets a bit slow at times, grind through it."
Black Bullet,"I never understood how this show got the buzz it did, its almost unwatchable to me let alone good because of how corny it is to me. It just seems super unrealistic"
Black Bullet," Man, season 2 was rough the first time I watched. Mostly because the series had ended when I started watching, so I wanted another drug trade season straight after watching the first one.

And then on my first rewatch it became one of my favorites."
Black Bullet,"I'm OK with a show being slower paced as i'm one of those people who personally never got bored watching any of the Marvel Netflix shows for a second, so if I can get through those I think I can handle season 2 and beyond of this show."
Black Bullet,"S2 does have a very slow buildup, bot boy does it pay off when all the plots come together in the last episodes. Watching it again made me realise how complex and masterful the storytelling is."
Black Bullet,"I'm currently watching season 2 (for the first time), and it does develop much slower than season 1."
Black Bullet,"Yeah, when that show is firing on all cylinders it is one of the best things to ever appear on television."
Black Bullet,It's boring and insists upon itself
Black Bullet,"I’m not the OP but I slightly prefer The Shield to The Wire, but it may shift on a rewatch, it’s very close. I saw both of their final seasons as they aired, and it was a really exciting year.

 The episodes contain a mix of things: the storyline following the main group goes through the whole season (and some events affect things years down the line). But it also follows other cops who have cases that wrap up in one or two episodes (but they also intertwine with the main group).

The Sopranos, The Shield, and The Wire are my top 3, so I think you’ll enjoy it. Deadwood and Mad Men are probably 4 and 5."
Black Bullet,"Nah The Shield is definitely not a procedural show, each episode leads into another and the show is very good with continuity, with certain plot points sometimes taking years to truly pay off and there's plenty of callbacks to previous episodes, self-contained is definitely not a term i'd use to describe it.  

The Shield is definitely more visceral and straightforward in comparison but it's still definitely head and shoulders above your traditional cop show in terms of character development and it's one of those shows where characters do have to face the consequences of their actions, nothing gets swept under the rug.  Stuff that happens in the pilot comes up at the very end.  Also the handheld camera filming style separates it from other shows and gives it a unique feel(but it's not like those godawful found footage films thank fuck)

One thing that both shows do right is giving the environments a ""lived in"" feel, where you feel like you are actually in dark and grimy places with the characters(the fact that Clark Johnson directed episodes on both shows definitely contributes to the similar feel)

I'd put a few of the Marvel Netflix shows ahead of Mad Men(especially The Punisher)

EDIT: OK seriously downvoting this comment is just fucking stupid"
Black Bullet,“Keep that shitmern youout hurrearninthis dolla like a muthafucka”
Black Bullet,"> Disregard those who say it's the worst season (which is 5).

Let me play devil's advocate, I do agree that the plots introduced in season 5 weren't as good as most of the rest, but at least half of season 5 is the development and conclusion of narratives from the previous seasons, and those include some of the best moments in the show. Much of what people remember as the stories of season 4 for example actually happened already in season 5."
Black Bullet,"I think as we move further away from the birth of the collective awareness of ""fake news,"" season 5 will resonate better with folks. In hindsight, it really was ahead of its time."
Black Bullet,"Yeah season 2 is my favorite. I’d rank them:

2 > 4 > 3 > 5 > 1

They’re all great though. It’s gotta be top 3 TV show all time for me."
Black Bullet,"Mine goes 3>4>1>2>5


Season 4 would have been my top pick if only there wasn’t a lack of McNulty. 

That’s just me"
Black Bullet,"Season 5 was only bad in comparison to The Wire's other seasons, it was still better than 95% of other TV shows."
Black Bullet,I really need to finish The Shield. I got up to season 3 and just stopped for some reason.
Black Bullet,"Yeah, it was Baltimore slang."
Black Bullet,"It's a Baltimore thing. I've never heard it anywhere else and, frankly, never heard it said that way when I lived there, so I don't know if it's a more recent invention (to avoid police-man/-woman) or just a jargon that the general public doesn't get to hear."
Black Bullet,I dunno.
Black Bullet,I've heard the term here and there in 90s California gangster rap music.
Black Bullet,"I'm already looking at it in a different way after reading many article on ""The Root"" but this show certainly is helping contextualize Baltimore(Trump's dumbass comments about the city is partially what spurred me on to finally take the plunge and start the show).

I've been reading Alan Sepinwall's ""Newbies"" recaps of season one(which avoids spoilers in future seasons) and those certainly help."
Black Bullet,"It was cocaine, wasn't it?"
Black Bullet,"Damn that sucks, hope she gets her life together."
Black Bullet,Sure thing.
Black Bullet,"Bubbles and Carver and two of my all time favorite character arcs in all of television

Edit: Carver not Carter.  Been a few years since I watched it."
Black Bullet,The reason they still do is because the city does not want their case to go anywhere so they deliberately give them shitty outdated equipment like typewriters.
Black Bullet,"I'm kind of already used to a new season feeling like a different show after watching The Shield, as season 4 was very different from anything that came before or after it, so i'm all up for that."
Black Bullet,"I KNOW it was reflecting the reality of Baltimore, no shit Sherlock, but all the same it WAS still a landmark in terms of representation on television at the time regardless of real life.

It's not a ""silly take away"" at all, especially given that i've seen quite a few people on pro-black websites like The Root have praised the show and David Simon for exactly that reason.

""off the hook"" for what?  Stating the truth?  That's just asinine."
Black Bullet,">Um...go to Baltimore and take a look at who's been in government, police, etc. It wasn't the show being 'ahead of its time', ffs.

It's not like shows haven't routinely taken what should be diverse settings and whitewashed them though. The fact that they also had a good amount of gender and sexual diversity is also impressive for the time period."
Black Bullet,"Of all the words i'd use to describe this show ""corny"" and ""unrealistic"" definitely are not the ones(You want corny and unrealistic?  Try those Hallmark channel original series)"
Black Bullet,Fucking Ziggy..
Black Bullet,"It was the same for me. I still enjoyed it the first time but I felt like I wanted to get back on the Barksdale track.

Having rewatched the show a few times, I'd place season 2 among the best of them."
Black Bullet,"Season 2's not boring, it's just ""where's all the black people"" but after watching a second time, it really is one of the better seasons. A lot of the key plotlines and a few important characters were introduced this season"

Black Bullet,"> I'd put a few of the Marvel Netflix shows ahead of Mad Men

I mean to each their own, but just know there's a reason why Mad Men is to this day considered a masterpiece. You can dislike a show without being brazenly disrespectful about it. At the end of the day it still has artistic integrity and was revolutionary for television... it's looked at as the first real prestige drama that wasn't on HBO and it basically launched AMC's legitimacy (which Breaking Bad obviously continued)."
Black Bullet,He meant a Lexus but he don't know it.
Black Bullet,"I totally disagree. If The Wire was trying to predict the trajectory of the media industry and ""fake news"", I think it kind of whiffed. Today's fake news isn't driven by ambitious reporters at legacy media outlets inventing long series of investigative reports because they want to win Pulitzers. It's driven by anonymous agitators churning out content that is designed to spread on the internet in order to advance extremist political agendas. IMO the newspaper stuff in S5 is the part of the show that is aging the worst."
Black Bullet,"It wasn't ahead of its time, it was telling a bit of history. 

The decay in the news industry has been happening for a very long time. It shows the paper ignoring journalistic standards (and indeed supporting wrong-doing) for awards which bring in readership. That this has now slid into clickbait, bad-faith/slanted/biased journalism, opinion-as-news, etc. isn't *The Wire* being prophetic, it's just adapting the same strategy to a new environment.

What happens when ""if it bleeds, it leads"" meets over-saturation, bad business models, failure to adapt, and financial pressure? Season 5 of *The Wire*. What happens when that continues? Today's slanted/fake-news/opinion-as-fact/inflame-emotions-for-clicks-and-likes approach."
Black Bullet,yea the non spoiler recaps help you focus on things you may not have noticed.
Black Bullet,"Trumps comments while crude weren't really off the mark, MD 7 is one of the most violent districts in the country and PBS actually aired a documentary about the rat infestation earlier this year. 

Cummings is a Clay Davis type of figure. 

I just finished reading Brian Tobbins book about the OJ Simpson trial and he has some pretty interesting things to say about how the media must report in a paternalistic manner about black subjects or risk being labelled racist. 

Trump does not do that, he will just as quickly condemn a black politician as he does a white one. It is jarring because you never see it. Black political leaders are often shielded from criticism because of race issues.  

Tobbin would likely be fired from his CNN job today if he publicly expressed the ideas he did 20 years ago."
Black Bullet,"It was cocaine ([source](https://www.tmz.com/2019/07/21/sonja-sohn-arrested-cocaine-possession-the-wire-chi/)) but I'd dispute that it is a ""fun"" fact."
Black Bullet,Carver* and that's EXACTLY who comes to mind for me!
Black Bullet,Really?  That’s actually the reason in the show ?
Black Bullet,"If you want to praise it for presenting a complex world without comment, I would agree with you. It's something we could use more of. When cast *The Wire*, awesome as it is, as a pioneer in this regard, it is a silly takeaway. 

When something is ""ahead of its time"" (like, say, *Police Squad!*) it doesn't find an audience because it *is* ahead of its time. *The Wire* didn't fail to find an audience, and the fact that it finds an larger audience as time goes on is hardly an indicator, as *Firefly* was hardly ""ahead of its time"" and its audience has grown with time. *I Spy*, for example, *was* a pioneer in its presentation, but not ""ahead of its time"": it found an audience for 80-odd episodes.

Praise from an ad-hoc group for an honest or even-handed portrayal by tv or movies is kinda expected when someone does it right (or even close to right). As an ex-resident of the environment *The Wire* portrays, I'll bloody sing its praises in that regard. There are also many other areas where I'll praise a movie/tv-show for just getting something right (hacking/hackers, technology, science, faith/religion, [er, damn, just insert the very, very long list here]) but while it may be worthy of praise from a particular perspective (even if only in the minds of those noticing), that doesn't make something ""ahead of its time"" as you'll find this kind of priase to be a recurrent theme. I'm not at all surprised that *The Root* praised *The Wire* (for a couple reasons), nor surprised that the phrase ""head of its time"" may have been used but that doesn't make it so; nor does it not being ""ahead of its time"" mean it isn't worthy of praise for an honest (as much as you can do in media) portrayal.

Often wide praise from an affinity-group comes from a version of ""this is the first time in a TV show where i've ..."" when it's really ""**i've seen**"" is the operative factor, rather than the show in a historical context. Another example is ""Star Trek showed the first interracial kiss"" when it was not the first. It can also come from the love of a piece of media and the desire to add another aspect of praise.

> ""off the hook"" for what?

smh... (*Ahem*) Not everyone using banterish language on the internet is attacking you. Take a deep breath, realize we share a love for an amazing show, and that dwarfs this side issue by many orders of magnitude."
Black Bullet,"Agreed, this Bernstein guy is out of his gourd."
Black Bullet,You're giving the show far more credit than is due in this particular regard.
Black Bullet,"Yea i mean im not being argumentative but i have been a police officer for 7 years in Detroit and nothing the police do in that show is even remotely real. Now ok I know its TV, but! For a show thats been harold as so real and authentic, it couldnt be any further from that. Just to name a few shows that are more realistic, NYPD Blue, Southland, and even The Shield were more realistic then what I saw in the first 2 seasons of The Wire."
Black Bullet,Malaka
Black Bullet,"That actor is good at playing characters I hate. E.g., Ray in *Generation Kill*."
Black Bullet,"One of the very rare poorly written and frustrating characters on the show. The entire time he's complaining about how everyone sees him as a joke and a screw up and never given a chance. 

However, the entire season Nick includes him in everything, his dad gives him chance after chance at the docks and every time Ziggy acts entitled and insulted that anyone would question him."
Black Bullet,"Yeah you should totally check out The Shield, Hulu has the entire series if you're interested."
Black Bullet,"Wasn't trying to be disrespectful, I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, Don Draper I just did not interesting in the least.

It's a well made show, it's just totally not for me at all."
Black Bullet,"Out of many favorite scenes, my absolute favorite."
Black Bullet,"Apparently that Newspaper storyline was based on a real life story being pushed by the Baltimore Sun, so it wasn't really a whiff."
Black Bullet,"I have to respectfully disagree in part.

> Today's fake news isn't driven by ambitious reporters at legacy media outlets **inventing long series of investigative reports because they want to win Pulitzers.**

The bold is true. And it isn't wholly ""driven"" by ""ambitious reporters at legacy media outlets,"" though it is certainly, at least at times, supported by some.

However to assert that ""legacy media outlets"" never use the tactics of it, and have in some cases relaxed journalistic integrity to the point of yellow journalism, I wonder if you're reading/consuming widely, at least in terms of national news (local news can vary wildly and some is still *incredibly* good at adhering to journalistic ethics).

>  ...churning out content that is designed to spread on the internet in order to advance extremist political agendas

This is an excessively narrow definition, I think. Most fake news is not ""extremist"" by the common context-definition you used. The danger of fake news is that it can be kinda-plausible and fit into preconceived (often emotional) impressions. The slow whisper is far more dangerous than the loud shout, and this is why opinion journalism is so dangerous, and the wise consumer reads very widely, very critically, and does a good deal of their own fact-checking.

(Hmm... Now that I think of it, maybe ""extremist"" might not be absolutely/entirely off the mark; however, it would be a slow-march to it rather than an overt call. The danger with that conceptualization, though, is that almost *any* disagreement in opinion could be labeled that errantly.)

>  anonymous agitators 

This, also, I must disagree with in part. ""Agitators"" I'll probably grant you, but few are anonymous.

> IMO the newspaper stuff in S5 is the part of the show that is aging the worst.

You're welcome to that opinion, and I'm not trying to be confrontational. How you consume news may, for all I know, support that opinion. I can't share that opinion though, and I think S5 is the most chilling because it ages too well."
Black Bullet,"Trump commented that the district is a place where ""no human being would want to live."" I *really* hope you're not gonna try to defend that."
Black Bullet,"Uh yes they were.

Don't tell you actually that moron Trump?

Trump is much worse towards minorities, did you see how he acted towards the squad?

Black people are not ""Shielded"" from criticism you racist moron.

Looking at your comment history you've said VERY stupid things(not there is no ""Anti-Trump hysteria"" the U.S. that's total fucking bullshit)

I see you're also one of those racists that insist the Central Park Five were ""like totally guilty yo!"" no they fucking weren't."
Black Bullet,Yeah they establish that in season one.
Black Bullet,"> The Wire didn't fail to find an audience

The Wire very much did fail to find an audience.  David Simon is very open about how low the viewership for the show was and the fact it only got 5 seasons because it was on HBO"
Black Bullet,"I don't think it's ""silly"" at all, i'm just saying what i've seen actual minorities say about the show, so you're essentially calling their opinions ""silly"" by extension.

""Ahead of it's time"" can mean a lot of things, it does not necessarily HAVE to mean it didn't find an audience(though the Wire's ratings never were that great so i'd argue even by your narrow definition it fits)

Never said you were ""attacking"" me, I just fail to see how it's a ""silly"" take when i'm just quoting what other people on black websites have said, you want to go to them and call their takes ""Silly"" as well?  there's a conversation i'd LOVE to see LOL, somehow I don't think you'd come out of that looking very good.

Let me guess, you're not a fan of ""The Root"" are you?  Are you one of those people that think Michael Harriot talks about racism way too much?

Also expecting every single person to understand when you're joking through mere text is a bit much, especially those of us like me who have autism."
Black Bullet,"No he's not, it deserves tons of credit and it's real easy for a straight white male like you who gets tons of representation to say that."
Black Bullet,"Well some other cops say differently:https://www.quora.com/What-do-police-officers-think-of-%E2%80%9CThe-Wire%E2%80%9D-TV-series-Does-it-accurately-show-what-life-is-like-for-police-officers

Black Bullet,"It's all based on real things, former Bmore city cops (even a chief of police) gave their input and acted in the show."
Black Bullet,I always thought that the show was more of a realistic (for TV) portrayal of the street drug scene than a realistic portrayal of the police. There are very few shows where the drug dealers are portrayed as real human beings not cartoonish bad guys.
Black Bullet,"I somewhat agree, although the Wire is great it's kinda too liberal/westwing-ish in it's portrayal of the police. There's very little overt racism in the show and I don't think you ever see the police planting drugs, pinning a crime on someone or murdering someone. The Wire would look very much different if it was done today."
Black Bullet,"> Malaka

Yeah, Malaka, right. Zigg fucked up the package."
Black Bullet,The character is supposed to be frustrating as a prodigal son archetype. Don't know why you see him as poorly written.
Black Bullet,"Idk how you can say you weren’t trying to be disrespectful when you read your post lol

If you don’t like it that’s fine, but don’t be a dick about it."
Black Bullet,"Yeah I'm not saying stuff like that never happens, I'm sure it still does. I'm saying that as a depiction of ""what's wrong with the media"", it feels super dated. It's not the show's fault - S5 aired over 10 years ago back when social media was pretty much a novelty. In fact it's amazing how timely most of The Wire still feels - the storylines about the docks, and the schools, and local politics still feel extremely relevant despite how much time has passed. IMO that makes it more noticeable how relatively poorly the newspaper stuff has aged."
Black Bullet,"I don't really disagree with anything you've written. I guess my point basically is that if you were to list the five most dominant forces/problems affecting the media industry today, all five would probably involve the internet in some way. As far as I remember, the internet may as well not exist in S5 of The Wire. It's set in the mid 2000s, but it's mostly based off of David Chase's own experience at the Baltimore Sun in the 80s and 90s. That's why I think it feels dated. Education, local politics, law enforcement still have the same problems they had 15 years ago. Those storylines still feel very timely. But journalism has been totally transformed by the internet and social media, and IMO the journalism stuff from S5 now feels like a remnant from an older era."
Black Bullet,"In not ""defending"" anything and already stated his comments and language are crude. You are doing exactly what I am talking about with that comment trying to infer racism where none exists. 

Are you saying Hillary Clinton is racist? She was labeled as such often in the 2008 campaign, the charges from the Obama campaign became daily media talking points when black primary states came into question. 

Do you seriously think ""accusations of racism"" are never used as a political tool?"
Black Bullet,"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/congress/md/07

There have been over 1100 gun deaths in MD 7 in the last 5 years, that is more than all 7 other districts in Maryland combined and ranks among the highest in the country. 

Here is an article about the Rat infestation that aired on PBS 

https://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/movies/bs-wk-movies-0915-story.html"
Black Bullet,"This was a weird tangent to take that avoided anything that guy was saying about The Wire/Baltimore.

Trump's crude comments about how bad of an area MD 7 is are basically true. The show, The Wire, while a fiction, shows that same area and how bad it actually is. Pretending that there aren't any issues in the area, doesn't make it better."
Black Bullet,"I have never said the Central Park Five were guilty of the rape and literally post to the source document that absolves them of it. 
How is that me saying they are guilty? 

The Central Park Five were indeed part of the group of 30 teens who beat, robbed and assaulted people that evening. They were NOT GULTY of the rape. 

Here is the actual Supreme Court document that vacated the charges against the five. This is literally the source document that absolves them. 

Although it does vacate the charges not related to the rape it does so only because they are intertwined with the rape case in the original trial. 

[NY Supreme Court Memo](http://wps.prenhall.com/wps/media/objects/13023/13335893/downloadables/NYDA%20motion%20in%20Jogger%20case.pdf)

Here is a small section where Richardson and Sanatana were acknowledging their involvement in the other attacks in 2002 interviews. 

> **In interviews in 2002, both Richardson and Santana candidly acknowledged involvement in criminal incidents that occurred on April 19**, while steadfastly asserting their innocence of rape. But none of this additional evidence was before the trial juries. Accordingly, it cannot be considered in evaluating the newly discovered evidence claim.

The new evidence was only relative to rape of the jogger but the AG agreed to the defence motion to vacate all the charges based on the prejudice created by the rape. 

> The newly discovered evidence at issue here relates directly only to those charges which arose out of the attack on the jogger herself. Factually, it has no relationship to the other crimes -- riot, robbery, and assault -- which occurred in Central Park on the night of April 19, 1989. Nonetheless, all of the defendants use the newly discovered evidence provided by Matias Reyes as the basis for a request that the court vacate their other convictions as well.

> The papers submitted on behalf of Kharey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Raymond Santana do not specify a legal basis for that request. Yusef Salaam argues that the nature and gravity of the charges involving the female jogger prejudiced the defendants' ability to receive a fair and dispassionate trial on the other charges against him.

> Under the extraordinary circumstances presented by this case, the People are constrained to consent to the defendants' motions with respect to the other charges of which they were convicted.

By their own admission members of the Central Park Five did commit the other crimes that evening but those were vacated along with the rape charge they were not guilty of. 

You actually proved the point Tobbin was making. I simply pointed out factual information and you became hysterically unhinged and immediately called me racist."
Black Bullet,Wow.  That might’ve been just what I needed to hear to watch now.  Thanks good friend
Black Bullet,"Yes, it struggled with neilson ratings and HBO expectations -- I never suggested that it didn't -- and yes it also found an audience. For an example of a show that did not find an audience, see *Police Squad!*. 

Shows that struggle with ratings (and there are many) have an audience but not one large enough to make the networks happy; shows that get don't reach the level of ""struggling with ratings"" haven't found an audience. I previously provided *Police Squad!* as the non-audience example for a reason."
Black Bullet,"> I just fail to see how it's a ""silly"" take when i'm just quoting what other people on black websites have said, you want to go to them and call their takes ""Silly"" as well? 

Are you insinuating that people can't have their opinions challenged or can't handle an opposing opinion or can't understanding an opposing opinion because they are minorities? Why should any person be able to do that with any other person? I don't care who you are, no immutable characteristic conveys you the inability to have a silly opinion, or to be told you have one, or to have a polite and fun conversation about it.

> Let me guess, you're not a fan of ""The Root"" are you? 

I haven't read it in a while; it used to be on my daily scan. My single persistent gripe about the Root was a propensity to see through racism as a lens, but you get that on left-wing, right-wing news sites, or any issue/group oriented site, so it's hardly a gripe I reserve singularly to the Root.

> Are you one of those people that think Michael Harriot talks about racism way too much?

It's troubling that you're trying to steer the conversation into this territory, and hardly good form.

> Also expecting every single person to understand when you're joking through mere text is a bit much
> Never said you were ""attacking"" me

You might want to pick an approach there, or at least stop making assumptions of what I expect. Your response seemed to be a mis-read, I overtly gave the context and an offer to enjoy talking about what we share regarding the show, and you've declined, so I'll leave it right there."
Black Bullet,"> straight white male

I wondered how long it'd take for someone to pull out their deck and make some assumptions so they could disregard an argument."
Black Bullet,"People can have different tastes. I am gay and I really don't like Call me by your name but it doesn't mean I am homophobic, I just had problems with the main character."
Black Bullet,"Yea I mean this may be true, but if I had to bet my life on wether this guy is not an officer or is just lying vs he is an officer who truly believes this, id bet the first. The depiction of the crime and how they do their day to day operations is for the most part a fair take. On the other hand everything the police do is almost laughable, specifically Lombardozzi and Gilliam’s characters more so then West."
Your Lie in April,what is it? drama? anime?
Your Lie in April,It is an anime. I think its classed as a 'Slice of life' anime. Its about a boy playing the piano and his past trauma with it.
Your Lie in April,I wouldn’t really categorize it as slice of life. It’s more of a Drama. Slice of life don’t really have the whole going to die soon element.

Your Lie in April,narcos. Most of it is in spanish
Your Lie in April,I just finished watching Ajin and really enjoyed that. The English voice acting was fine if you don't want to read subtitles and the animation style takes a bit to get used to but it had some truly epic action sequences. 
Your Lie in April,Club de Cuervos (México) is pretty funny.
Your Lie in April,"I really enjoyed Terrace House. It felt very refreshing to have a reality show that wasn't entirely staged and filled with drama, maybe it is due to the cultural differences but it felt very laid back and calming when compared to Western reality shows. Also the panel that critique the residents are savage which always makes me laugh."
Your Lie in April,Loved Lilyhammer
Your Lie in April,"""Bad Guys"", Korean TV show. This former cop is brought back to solve a brutal set of murders, and with the police outmatched and support lacking, he brings in three convicted felons to help him. Lot of action, great acting by the four characters, and just really fun overall.

""Iris"", also Korean. Spies, North and South Korean tensions, assassinations, betrayal, lots of action. Just ignore the last 15 or so seconds before the credits (because it's a fucking travesty). There's also a spin off, Athena: Goddess of War, and a sequel, Iris II, which I'm diving into shortly. 

"
Your Lie in April,"Grand Hotel. I wasn't planning to watch anything non-English at all, but I was hooked within minutes after clicking on to it out of curiosity.

I binged the whole show (abt 50 episodes) in two weeks! Because of Grand Hotel I'm now way more interested in Spanish productions. "

Your Lie in April,"Yes! I always recommend this - it's melodramatic and ridiculous but so so engrossing.  I personally describe it as Downton meets Poirot* meets a daytime soap.

at least in terms of their original shows"
Your Lie in April,"This show won't have too much to edit out, maybe an occasional ""shit"" or f-bomb (which is weird hearing on a multi-cam sitcom to begin with).

The pilot did have a two characters trying remote-control sex toys on each other, they might have to drop that entire scene."
Your Lie in April,"And, I don't know if you've ever watched Freeform, but they have near-equal amounts of showtime and commercials. It's unbearable to try to sit through. I feel bad for anyone that has to experience content that way."

Your Lie in April,I occasionally get sucked into whatever movie marathon they're showing on a lazy weekend and the commercial breaks gets so unbearable that if I really like the movie I just look for it on streaming and watch that.
Your Lie in April," i mean I wish that show continued and I could watch it instead of this one. not that this one is bad....I think this formula is easy and comfortable as a sitcom and I mean that as a compliment. i think it just had a better chance with Her and Cheeto as her brother, had two really god writers in the cast could have been a great sequel. but then we probably wouldn't be getting the most bizarre looking Barbie movie that has me intrigued."
Your Lie in April,"The joke setups have been better but the dialogue often still feels stilted and I also don't think the cast has great chemistry together (which could be the fault of the writers for having such a terrible setup where most of the main characters barely knew each other before the pilot). 

Have some gripes with HIMYM like most people do but those are things that HIMYM never had issues with."
Your Lie in April,"Definitely felt like an idea HIMYM would do. 

I feel like the episodes this season are noticeably better than Season 1, and the show feels like its catching it's stride. That said, my wife and I still call out parallels to stuff HIMYM would do (not sure if it's a positive or negative to notice them)."
Your Lie in April,Has there been any news on when is City Primeval airing? I think it is unlikely that it will air in Spring now since it will miss the Emmy deadline.

There is currently few* serial ""made for tv"" movie franchises. This is a niche that would be a great fit for streaming.

I remember binging these on A&E during summer holidays. A new feature daily! The very end of the run was still cranking out an occasional movie, which was a treat.

Mark Ruffalo looks a lot like Detective Colombo.

*BBC did this with Sherlock.
*ITV does this with Midsummer Murders
*Father Brown exists.
*i should have said North American. The Brits seem to love this."
Fuller House,Twin Peaks 4 -- both categories
Fuller House,"Can only think of the one I want brought back.

Do Over with Penn Badgley should have never been cancelled and be brought back. 

Boston Public 

Pushing Daisies 

Forever

Mercy 

Red Band Society

Pitch 

Paper Girls

G.L.O.W."
Fuller House,I feel like Lost reboot is inevitable sadly
Fuller House,"I will add Rubicon and Lodge 42 to the list as well. 

New seasons of Rubicon could have cameo or two from the original stars. It doesn’t have to have the same cast, just the same organizations at work. 

For Lodge, you’d probably have to get most of the great original cast to sign back on. But one can dream!"
Fuller House,"The few I would want 
1. A modern Yes Prime Minister (set during the final weeks of Brexit. Yet I don't want Jim Hacker to be the face of this)

2. Moral Orel 
 I really want to see Orel as an adult. This show really hit me hard.

3. Garfield
 I want my fat orange cat

4. Upstart Crow
More David Mitchell as Shakespeare"
Fuller House,"and this would be the one time where a reboot with a more diverse cast would completely make sense and not take away from the story in any way

although I will say this (and Im black if that matters) but I liked Cheers and and I dont have a problem with there being no major black characters. I dont believe you always need a “token”. I like the Jamie Foxx show too and dont feel they need to apologize for an all black cast.

I absolutely think there should be a space for that type of casting as it does reflect life."
Fuller House,2 Broke Girls called.
Fuller House,That show had a weird but still familiar energy that I think could take off today and probably with a reasonable budget.
Fuller House,This!!!!!!!!!!
Fuller House,Only Murders in the Building is a great show!
Fuller House,"> Columbo

I believe Poker Face with Natascha Lyonne is going to be a modern-day take on it."
Fuller House,Mos Def?
Fuller House,"Ok I just looked this up. OMG bro it looks amazing. I put it on My List for tomorrow night.

Have yourself a beer. Cheers mate."
Fuller House,Funny enough there is and [episode](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x595a9g) about something similar where Jesse lies about the twins' academic abilities to get them in to a prestigious preschool. Aunt Becky's moral compass steered right where Lori Loughlin's allegedly went left.
Fuller House,"I mean, isn't this what Full House is made for??? A ready made story: 

Mistake>Lie>Things get out of control>Jessie saves the day with wisdom.

This is the show's entire formula. They should use it. "
Fuller House,"I guess they didn’t decide to

Have Mercy"
Fuller House,"I knew that they would
CUT
HER
OUT"
Fuller House,K so well miss two cameos from her in the final season.
Fuller House,Everywhere you look...things are getting worse for her. 
Fuller House,[deleted]
Fuller House,"Imagine being well off, a nice TV career, and as awesome Aunt Becky only to lose to all because your daughters are too dumb to get in to the school and then proceed to waste it by partying it . What was even the point? She wasn't going to actually study, she was basically there to have the ""college party life."" Should've just let her go to whatever school accepted her and save that $500K instead, money lost, fired, hated, and most likely will be made an example of. What a fucking idiot "
Fuller House,Fuller house was already canceled
Fuller House,"Why isnt the school being punished for taking bribes?

Edit: Im being told that the people involved have resigned/been fired. Yay"
Fuller House,"All this yapping about her, but the guy that was setting all this up is well known for arranging ""charities"" for celebs and media types. Bono was his wingman for christ sakes."
Fuller House,This scandal feels weirdly forced
Fuller House,"Lol maybe it's just me but I don't think college should just be an expensive status symbol for the rich, it needs to, you know, give people an education so the complex tasks in society can work. So yeah, fuck these people. 

Sincerely,

A guy who used to help stupid rich kids with their homework in a fancy private school and got to watch them glide into six figure paying jobs while I had to become an Uber driver."
Fuller House,"Interesting how our society treats cheaters.

Two actresses are being made an example of, but what actions are being taken against all those CEO’s that did the same thing? Are they being arrested at gunpoint and fired from their positions? "
Fuller House,The craziest thing about this story is I didn’t even know it was illegal and assumed every rich person since the beginning of time did this shit.
Fuller House,"Why is everyone here uninformed af? Everyone keeps complaining about why the universities aren’t being punished for accepting bribes. If y’all actually decided to read news articles that are located under the headlines, you’d see that the universities themselves had nothing to do with it. These various rich people paid this company called KWF to do all this dirty work. 

KWF operates a testing center where they basically had their testing genius change wrong answers after the kids turn in the SAT/ACT. Sometimes they would just straight up help the kids during the test. It was up to the parents if they wanted their kid to feel a sense of accomplishment for doing the test “on their own.”

KWF also bribed coaches into labeling the kids as recruits. This obviously grants the kids a more favorable status in the eyes of the admissions dept. They would even create false profiles of these kids on various high school athletics pages just to trick the admissions depts. The only thing I don’t really understand is how the coaches got away with it for so long. I’m guessing coaches are allowed to recruit more students than there are roster spots since some of the roster spots are for walk-ons.

What these people did is not equivalent to rich people donations. At least when rich people donate to the school, it directly impacts the school and all of the students in a positive way. These people committed fraud. The coaches, actors, businesspeople, etc. committed fraud. The schools did not commit fraud. They had no idea what was going on. They were most likely mad that the money was going into someone else’s pocket rather than their own."
Fuller House,Fuller House is still airing?
Fuller House,"She and her husband have a combined net worth of $100 million.

Why on earth would she be so interested to get her kids in the best schools? They're already set for life!  
They should let their kids be kindergarten teachers or truck drivers if they want to, it's not like they have to work for the *money*."
Fuller House,We knew it was coming. More curious on how they write her out. 
Fuller House,"If you're going to spend half a million dollars getting your kids into college, why would you do the illegal thing of cheating and bribery when you could just donate half a million to the school legally and they will just ignore their grades? If both routes essentially cost the same amount, why would you choose the felonious way over the legal way?"
Fuller House,"i worked at a private high school and the amount of shaddy shit that i seen happen there sickened me. I went through the canadaian public school system and worked my ass off to get into a decent college. These kids did half the work and got amazing scholarships and got into programs that are impossible to get into. WHY and how? donations made to the school over several years, $2500 a month in tuition fees, and if you put your kid kg-12 you are almost guaranteed that he/she will make it into a prestigious school/program. Database admin who finalized grades often got told to bump up certain students marks. This would never happen in public school. Man rich are powerful "
Fuller House,Does this mean that rich kids everywhere will now be accepted by competence alone?... 
Fuller House,maybe there's hope for a RAD sequel. 
Fuller House,"I would watch the show if they kept her. But, as punishment, Becky’s character does something unethical and they spend the entire season lecturing her on what she did wrong and making her do community service. It would be gratifying. "
Fuller House,"Isn't this how rich people work? I thought this was just the way of the world, not a scandal. "
Fuller House,Donations admissions are still OK though 
Fuller House,Full House -> Fuller House -> Big House
Fuller House,10s of people will be affected by this.. 10s!
Fuller House,"I know that rich people get away with stuff normal people can’t. I know this is a big deal and yet another example of the unfair advantage of being rich. But this reaction feels forced. Outrage culture, as usual, feels slightly off-target. You want outrage? You want the finest recent example of wealth and privilege facilitating disgusting behavior? Jeffrey Epstein. Hands down. But people are only talking about this and R. Kelly."
Fuller House,Fired from a show that's airing it's final season this year. Way to take a stand and make a difference.
Fuller House,What a sad day for discount Cindy Crawford. 
Fuller House,"Lol eveyone focusing on the celebrity, but there were plenty of other people involved, and many more that won't be caught.  As usual a couple of scapegoats will take the brunt of the public's scorn."
Fuller House,The real question is when the kids are kicked out of college. 
Fuller House,"Everywhere you look, Everywhere you go, there's a cot (there's a cot) and a cell mate named Brenda. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there's a stabbing in the yard. Everywhere you go"
Fuller House,I will never watch “Fuller House” again!
Fuller House,"i dont like firing people before they get convicted. I feel the same way with any type of crime for regular people too. Its too reactionary. Feel the same way about Jussie Smollett. Our culture has decided that innocent until proven guilty is bullshit and we ignore it. 

I feel the same way if somebody is working a regular job and gets arrested for something and then gets fired without being convicted. "
Fuller House,Now it's Not as Full House? Orrrr House With Vacancy?
Fuller House,I feel like there Is a lot of knee jerk reactions by these tv companies
Fuller House,"Hopefully they dig up a lot more. Pretty sure lots and lots of wealthy people do that and deserve to go down in infamy.

They cheat a lot of hardworking poor students out of admissions so their less than intelligent spoiled kids can get in."
Fuller House,"I have a bigger problem with the people on the other end, that took her money and let her unqualified kid in, than I do with her, trying to help her kid get into a school she normally wouldn't be able to get into.  That doesn't excuse what she did either."
Fuller House,"Crap, I thought Fuller House was just a stupid reunion one-season show.  Didn't realize it was still actually being filmed."
Fuller House,The show was over anyway. They weren't planning on making anymore seasons after the current season. 
Fuller House,"Does this mean Jessie can sleep
with other women? "
Fuller House,"This coming season is the final one anyway. It sounds like from the article they haven't filmed yet so I wonder if they're going to write her off (like her and Jesse divorce, she passes away, etc) or she just won't appear and they just won't mention her."
Fuller House,I don't understand why nothing is said of USC for accepting this bribe ? Am I misunderstanding. And a lot of rich people do this for their kids but they call it a donation. .... ?
Fuller House,Seriously who’s watching this show anyway? I checked out the very first episode in hopes of Jodi Sweetin would get those titties out but it didn’t happen and I never went back. It was painfully bad.  
Fuller House,"Not defending anyone, just curious as to why out of the supposed 750 families this guy took bribes from that it's only Lori Laughlin that is being talked about. 750 families? There has got to be some government and corporation snobs in there that should be dealt with too. Of course I haven't looked into it too much so the info is probably there."
Fuller House,"Good!
Now they need to go after Rodney Dangerfield and him buying and  scamming his way thru Grand Lakes University just to be with his son (and that diving team he somehow got on the roster for)!!   "
Fuller House,If it’s just going to be some quick headlines cause of a “b” level star. Presidents did this all types of politicians did this. No ones batted an eye and now we taking a stand. It’s a week late and a buck short.  You wanna call it start then let it be a start but that would mean these crimes will continue to receive the same headlines. 
Fuller House,"Fuller House: Alcatraz

"
Fuller House,"I think the attention on these actresses is hiding more prominent players in plain sight. Let's talk about some of the CEOs and school administrators that allowed this to come to fruition. 

The star power of these two actresses shouldn't be distracting us from the potential ""true"" masterminds."
Fuller House,Hopefully she will do some porn now. 
Fuller House,[deleted]
Fuller House,Hopefully she turns to porn to fund further educational endeavors.  I'd pay for that. 
Fuller House,"I mean sure she should be punished, but like it's already been stated, where the fucks the penalties and bad press for all these asteemed academic institutions that accepted the bribery to begin with?"
Fuller House,This is such a stupid scandal.
Fuller House,And yet the politicians and businessmen who did such things are protected or ignored.
Fuller House,Yet Jessy Smollet was just slowly written off the last two episodes without actually being fired. Wtf. Both deserve firing 
Fuller House,"Ah, my daily dose of schadenfreude has arrived."
Fuller House,Never got the way american uni's will accept people for being on a sports team.
Fuller House,"Am I the only one who thinks she shouldn't have gotten fired? I guess it's the cynic in me that assumes so many people are doing this, so why punish a select few? Kind of like perks and pay in college football. "
Fuller House,"It won't be the popular opinion, but I think they are just making her the poster child for this. Buying your way into elite institutions has been going on since higher education  began. From politicians, to high-powered executives, to trust-fund benefactors, public figures, and on and on. If they're going to do this to her, they should start bringing in a mix of others as well. 

Appropriate thing to do would be to fine her & funnel that fine into programs to help students w/o means, take a leave from the show (or work it into the script somehow like someone else mentioned), and do community restitution which could consist of helping disadvantaged high school students complete college applications, prepare for entrance exams, etc. You know, the stuff that should have rightfully been done in the first place. 

Have her do this for 4 years-- the time it takes to graduate most colleges & universities with a bachelor's (or whatever track her daughter was on.) By then she & others forced to do this or face jail time should have learned their lesson & set an example for others which i believe is the point of all this..."
Fuller House,Well she’s gonna wish she didn’t waste all that money on her kid who didn’t even wanna be there in the first place! 
Fuller House,"""She will not be in the upcoming fifth season""

FIFTH season?? I thought there had only been the first season, and one follow up season so far. They've already churned out 4?!"
Fuller House,"She paid almost 5 times the basic tuition fee of USC!? I don't know who this reflects worse on, her or her daughter. They must be some diehard Trojan fans.   "
Fuller House,"Well, that sucks. "
Fuller House,Oh have mercy!
Fuller House,So are the schools going to be held responsible for accepting bribes for admissions? They sort of created the problem.
Fuller House,"""You only get one shot at your reputation""

- Lori Loughlin"
Fuller House,I still think she’s Rad. 
Fuller House,Whatever happened to predictability?
Fuller House,She couldn’t bribe them?
Fuller House,Wonder how much it's gonna cost her to get back on. 
Fuller House,She's been picked up by Orange is the New Black.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Don't get me wrong, i loved the anime. 

But holy shit. It ended perfectly, why the fuck do we need to redo it?!
Goddamn lazy basterds and their cashouts, good lord."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,You should really post an English source when it becomes available instead of the untranslated Japanese one.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I'm conflicted, one of my favorite anime's so obviously I want more but it had such a good ending, arguable one of the best in anime. Also I can't read the article (it's in Japanese) so I don't know if it's a new 24 episode anime or a movie or an OVA.  "
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,I still get surprised when anime stuff gets upvoted to the front page of subreddits not devoted to anime. 
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Nice!
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I don't know about this. I really loved the first series, but the second had a lot of problems. But, it had an absolutely perfect ending that nearly redeemed that whole second season. I wouldn't mind more coming from this universe, but trying to bring back Lelouch? eh..."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"""THERE IS A LIGHT AT MY WORLD END. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT NOW TO DEFEND. IT FLIES OFF IN THE WIND!!!"""
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,I hope it's not focused on the magical stuff
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I'm more concerned with the link on that site that says there's NEW CARDCAPTOR SAKURA ANIME?!?!??!!!!! How did I not know? Oh god, I can't find good information about it to find out if it's a remake or a sequel. Please don't let it be a remake.

Edit: It's the TV adaptation of the new manga sequel. ; u;

Re: Code Geass - Anime sequels are always so hit or miss. Hopefully it'll be a good addition to the series. I love CLAMP's art, so as long as they're involved in the sequel's design work, I'll give it a shot."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"So isn't this supposed to be the 4th season?
I haven't notice anybody mention ""Akito the Exiled"" as the third season"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Was not expecting this. After the way the second season ended, I can only see this anime continuing via Timeskip."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I'm hyped guys, what do I do with my hands?"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,How much Pizza Hut will be in this version?
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Jesus the top banner of that site is like everything that turns people off of anime. There's nude catgirl bullshit and hentai right there. I mean this is part of why Code Geass is one of the few animes I've watched. 
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Was code geass based of a manga? If there are more chapters then I don't see why not. Honestly, I saw the show like 10 years ago so I don't remember everything that happened. Anyone else have to rewatch it?"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,like the anime but I did not care all that much for the character design in this show 
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Eww no. Anime Sequels tend to be garbage due to the change in creative team, removing what made the original great or simply amplifying the bad bads of the original.

See the sequels series to:

Euraka 7 

The Last Exile 

And Dragon Ball Super."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Cause that worked out great for Last Exile and Eureka Seven.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"The first season was good but the second season was awful. I will not be watching this.

Edit: Classic /r/television, downvote people who have a different opinion than you on a TV show!"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,He didn't die in the original Japanese version doh.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,What? The second season was a mess. A redo could fix so many issues.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Google chrome translate works perfectly and makes it completely legible.

/s"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Doesn't look like anything to me.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Come on where are all the hardcore anime fans?
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Just the big ones. I'm not really an anime fan but even I was exposed to Code Geass and enjoyed it. Similarly, stuff about AoT, FMA, or Cowboy Bebop will always get upvoted here. "
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"That was a spin-off of sorts, not part of the main series."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"From what I understand, it takes place several years in the future."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I wasn't going to click and visit the site, but you convinced me."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Pretty much the problem I have with anime, I just want to watch shit like PATLABOR without running into this rubbish."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"The anime is an original. The manga (the one with Lelouch of the Rebellion) is the adaptation, while the Suzaku of the Counterattack is an AU of the original with Suzaku as the protag."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I could be wrong, but I think the original is the anime. But they made  a manga series based on it."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I thought everyone changed their perception of Super after the first 10-20 episodes? I haven't watched it yet, but I do remember hearing that Super got good after they stopped adapting the 2 new movies. "
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,[deleted]
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"It as a mess, but ending was good again.

And it probably won't be a redo."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"So, I liked the second season, but I've not got a good eye for spotting messy shows usually. Can I just ask, in what way was it messy do you think?"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I don't agree, butI do think the ending was just so perfect. "
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Bah. It wasn't exactly a sensible season, i give you that, but just tacking something onto the story is even worse.

""We kinda had a mess on our hands and some things didn't add up. Let's ressurect Lelouch and try again! That will totally work out, now that the world is (supposedly) at peace and rebuilding!""

Unless you go into the future or a different dimension. That would actually be fun, tbh. Lelouch, with his knowledge, trying again to fix it. 

Guess we will see. My problem really isn't with them using the universe, it's more the using of a character whose ARC IS DONE. FINISHED. OVER.

Spoilers: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Basically Kirai Nikki. That'd be fun. 

############################

"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"idk why you are getting so much flack, I guess people are really defensive about the show. imo 2nd season wasn't absolutely terrible, but for me it was that I felt it should have ended in the first season, and the 2nd felt less original and engaging. The show at first really blew me away, it was consistently excellent, and I was waiting for the perfect ending as all the final pieces came into play. Instead I got a cop-out that made little sense and essentially reset most of the gains made in the first season. It felt like something just to continue the show because it got so popular. 

I'm most of the way through season 2, but it lost my interest to continue. Everyone's talking about the final ending so maybe I will try getting through it again :/"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,[deleted]
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Also, death note"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Has nothing to do with being correct. Welcome to Reddit.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,That ending was one of the best endings to a show in my opinion. 
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Did they not already redo it? Aren't there like two or three versions of this show already?
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Personally I love Season 2 overall, but the bit with Charles' master plan and that whole arc felt very rushed. 


But then after that's wrapped up it's an amazing run to the end."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"First season was mostly what the creators wanted it be.

Second season was forced and mostly a money grab by the financiers, hence the too much *fan service* and stretched thin useless plots.

To put it into perspective, season one was Breaking Bad, and season two was season 4 of Arrow."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Going to stay positive and assume the post is downvoted for lack of reasoning to my opinion, even though you can find ten other people online who've worded it better than I can.

And yeah dude, stick with season 2. The bad parts were always laughably funny, at least."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Westworld
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,The ending was a good ending but i don't feel it was the right ending. 
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"There's the two seasons of the anime, a series of OVA that are totally separate (Akito the Exiled or something), and then probably some video games, visual novel, manga, radio drama adaptations and stuff - like a lot of anime. But I don't think they've straight up redone it before."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Yeah, I heard a little bit about that before I watched, and that whole segment seemed a little weird. Like usually it's ""we interrupt your political thriller to bring you high school nonsense"" but instead it was ""weird, vague philosophy you probably don't understand because everyone is talking in theoretics""

Ending was great; when LeLouch comes out and - don't know how to spoilers, but that whole scene, pretty damn grand."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,">season two was season 4 of Arrow.

Some serious hyperbole there. Season 2 wasn't as good as the first, but it wasn't bad. 

It's an anime. Look at its' competitors for quality standards."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Holy fuck what a shit post. 

Ur reason for the second season being shit is devoid of any substance to determine any valid reason or argument and sounds like comments from an angsty hipster who was upset at not being acknowledged as the best barista around."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,It's not over until I see the cart driver. 
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"really? I adored the ending, so perfect "
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"So I guess the second season would be R2? As a kid it got so confusing I stopped watching, I also wasnt as savvy with finding where to watch them. "
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Yeah, R2 is the second season. There's a year time-skip then it's back into the action."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I always thought it was like a redo or something wow. I know how it ends but I never got to see the rest, I know what I'll be doing later lol."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I'd recommend checking it out. Even if you know the ending, I think the middle part should still be entertaining enough. It's got all the mecha-fighting, political mindgames and stupidly silly schemes of the first series - there's a brilliant on in the first half that's just so damn... sneaky."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"This reminds me of a post I saw on Twitter with all the character posters from Rogue One asking ""Who deserves their own show next?"". I'm not so sure that the character of Cassian Andor even ""deserved"" his own show. Don't get me wrong Andor is maybe my favorite tv show this year and certainly the best thing on Disney+ to date, but the show wasn't carried on the back of some hype worthy but underutilized character, it was carried by a incredible supporting cast, a smart and thoughtful script, and beautiful cinematography and production design. None of the characters in Rogue One are untapped mines of obvious potential, but if you take any of them and treat them with the same care as a character that Tony Gilroy gave to Cassian Andor you could probably find another critical hit among the cast."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,The star was the friends we made along the way
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"ok, now the andorian’s are just trolling this subreddit, right?"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,I could be marooned on an uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean and a message in a bottle would wash up and all the message would say would be “have you watched Andor yet?”
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,what is this r/andor
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,The r/television subscribers were never the star of this subreddit - the disney PR team was
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Bold move posting more Andor stuff here. Hope it pays off for you.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Yo, if you guys don’t stop the Andor spam I’m gonna go ahead and block this sub, this shit is ridiculous, admins wtf is this"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"wow you blew my mind, headline."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,That’s it.  I’m officially boycotting this show.  Someone has to take a stand.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"How much more $$$ is Disney going to throw at these “articles?”

The brand is damaged, Andor could be The Sopranos (it’s not even close to the best of HBO) and those fans who left the franchise still won’t return. 

The constant barrage is now keeping people away."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Shut up about Andor, Jesus Christ"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,I’m about to unsubscribe if I see another Andor post. This shit is brutal.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Just make it stop
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I’ve been on a hunger strike until I stop seeing Andor articles here, I think I’m going to starve to death…."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Damn what even is this headline? What a ""nothing"" sentiment - like why is this even a thing being pondered in journalism?"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Another Andor post? Disney people must be working overtime now.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"No, he's the star of the show. He's name is in the title and gets top credit."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,I honestly think this show would’ve done better numbers if it was called Rebellion or something. Andor wasn’t a very memorable character in Rogue One in my opinion and thinking it was about him made me write it off immediately. I didn’t know how great the show would be!
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I’m begging people to actually value actors who give more subdued/withholding/quiet performances. Cassian Andor and OJ Haywood from *Nope* are two of the most impressive performances of the year in part because Luna and Kaluuya are doing so much skillful work on the margins without being given loud, declarative dialogue. Little smirks, facial twitches, brief looks, a small scoff… this stuff matters just as much (and maybe a lot more, honestly) as the louder performances that get most of the attention.

Diego Luna does impeccable work all across the series to build, bit by bit, a convincing character who’s silence and quiet nature speaks magnitudes. Cassian wants very badly to be just some side character in the world of this budding rebellion. Some dude who just clocks in, robs a vault, and then gets to live comfortably in obscurity. So of course he keeps his head down, and stays quiet, and tries hard not to ruffle any feathers. The beauty is in watching him - and watching his face - realize that isn’t possible, and that the Empire (read: fascism) will come for everyone, including him and the people he loves. So he might as well fuckin’ fight.

I love just about every supporting performance in the show (Ebon Moss-Bachrach! Fiona effin’ Shaw! Adria Arjona! Alex Lawther! Andy Serkis! Denise Gough! All so good!) but let’s not get it twisted: Luna is the star and he’s a damn good one. Just the kind of star that often goes unfairly overlooked."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Wake up babe. More paid Andor articles.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Let’s not forget his mother also has the name Andor and she was an important part of the rebellion uprising.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Babe, it’s time for your four times daily Andor article."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Oh man, I'm glad someone finally made a post about Andor.  I haven't seen ANYTHING about it on /r/television before."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"I'm sick of being told to watch this. I'm going to make it my life's goal to never watch it out of spite.


Edit: I'm also going to tell other people they shouldn't watch it. Not actively, but like if it ever comes up in casual conversation I'll say they shouldn't watch it."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Watching the finale was a strange experience. It was literally about an occupying army suppressing local rebellion. It was so on the nose there was even an IED explosion scene. Yet American audiences feel like they are identifying with the rebels.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"They should have called the show ""The Uprising"" or ""The Rebellion"" and more people would've watched. A lot of people didn't find the premise interesting knowing the fate of the protagonist. Also, Andor wasn't particularly interesting in Rogue One. I feel like if they renamed the show and have Andor in it as a character a lot more people would've watched."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"No, B2EMO was."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,We were all Cassian Andor
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,i blocked u/chrisbokiul because of the Andor spam on my front page now this shill is picking up the slack.
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"As I was watching the show, I honestly kept thinking if it even needed to be about Cassian at all. Like it could easily have been the exact same with a brand new character instead of Cassian."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Andor fucking sucks
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Andor big good Star Wars show, nobody talk watch Andor so good TV, Star show good Wars talk watch Andor, best Disney big Andor good show, watch? Talk nobody Wars? Star Andor!"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"After all these paid puff pieces that are posted here, I've been telling people not to watch it. It feels like an awful show and I will tell this to everyone."
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,This is the way
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"So yea I've ultimately accepted that this sub and those websites are nothing more than a stinking pile of advertisements in disguise, going to unsub"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Do I need to unsub from r/television? Why is there a post about this show every day? FFS
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Leaving this sub until Andor ends
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"Babe wake up, another Andor post"
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,Alright it's about time to unsub from these garbage circle jerk subs
Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion,"It’s the best Star Wars property. I am 39, so it’s mature theme carried me like rouge one, even more so. I never really was all in on the rest of Star Wars,  but more of this and you will have a new wave of different Star Wars fans."
Cooked,I doubt anyone is going to really watch this but I’m loving it. Such a low key show. Surprised to see Kore-eda’s name attached to it
Cooked,"I only have three episodes left to watch, but this is probably going to be one of the highlights of the year for me. Japan is going strong lately. 

It's a really fluffy, warm and relaxing drama, with a great direction from famous director Kore'eda (he's not the only director here though), that focuses a lot on food, and how it can be a form of art and something that can tie people together and even make them feel better (it reminds me a little of the movie Babette's Feast for this aspect), and on the Japanese traditions related to the Maikos and Geikos/Geishas; there are even some terms like Ichi-go-ichi-e strictly related to Japan's culture that make it feel like the viewer is stepping into a different world.

 Definitely recommended for people who are interested in Japan and who like watching slice of life movies."
Cooked,"I thought this sounded familiar. It’s the live action version of Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House anime on Crunchyroll! Will definitely check it out, thanks for the heads up."
Cooked,"I just binge watched this today on Netflix.

It was wonderful. The scenery and acting were excellent. I hope they continue to make more episodes."
Cooked,"I like the show, only two episodes in! But that additional roommate always speaking downfall on these girls 💀 like girl go on somewhere"
Cooked,"Up to episode 2 so far. Soothing and warm, and the characters are so well-done. Hope there's more of grandma!"
Cooked,"Truly a calming, beautiful show. Really enjoying it. 

Honestly thought it was a reality based cooking show when I saw it listed on Netflix & just ignored it until I saw this thread. Decided to check it out & I'm glad I did. 🥹"
Cooked,"Is this a Korean drama? What’s it about?

I saw it on my homepage and was intrigued. It looks simple and the cinematography looked great in the trailer. I just don’t get much about the plot or story."
Cooked,"Binged the whole series the last few days.

It fills the hole of Ted Lasso but with the added bonus of food.

I love how happy everyone is and that there are no real enemies just people trying to cope with their own inner demons.

Wishing for a second season.

>!Is Sumire dyslexic or can't read? I didn't get the restaurant scene with her not being able to understand the menu.!<"
Cooked,"Loving it so much, I’m going to re-watch until another season comes out!"
Cooked,Just finished it. Couldn't love it any harder!
Cooked,"Just finished this and it's like a young adult version of Midnight Diner. it was absolutely soothing to me (apart from Yoshino who needs to have far less air time imo) and I loved the low key anticipation of seeing Sumire complete her training into becoming a full Maiko. The house and family unit felt so real to me, and I was entranced by the little details like the hair accessories, room decoration, religious elements and food. Such a beautiful series, I'd love to see more!

Edit: typo"
Cooked,Would someone for the love of god recommend more shows like this? I've never watched a Japanese tv show and now I can't think of anything else.
Cooked,"Kiyo and Sumire are DEFINITELY gay for each other, right? The subtext is basically bold text."
Cooked,I don’t have the heart to watch until it’s over. Netflix will just pull the rug before it’s concluded
Cooked,"No offense to the people who love this. I'm sorry, we were so looking forward to this, having loved several Japanese shows and knowing the history of Japanese cinema. We couldn't get past episode three with the obnoxious, overacting woman who returns to the group, and the Night of the Living Dead bit, used only because the film is in the public domain. The music is terrible, and the acting worse. I have Japanese friends  - who actually work in the Japanese food industry  - who had trouble following the overlapping dialogue.  And yes, I love shows about nothing. A much better show is Pension Metsa on Mhz, which actually has a point. Kore-eda is not a show runner, and his camera work is blah. How he approved that horrible music is anybody's guess."
Cooked,Found this to be too slow and border line boring I jumped to the last episode 😉
Cooked,"Contrary to the popular opinion, I love Momoko, Yoshino and Ryoko. Yoshino is the cool friend I'd love to have, Momoko is like a big sister that would always give sound advice and Ryoko is the girl I'd like to hang out with to talk about more intimate emotions about the future, love and belonging.

I love all the characters, even the make-up guy (forgot his name) who sounds grumpy most of the time."
Cooked,I’m watching it now and loving it. It’s actually nice to see a kind of celebration of the small things in life. Cinematography is beautiful
Cooked,Never underestimate the worlds love for japanese food and culture
Cooked,It’s gathered quite a few fans amongst my friends. Sort of a cult hit at least.
Cooked,It’s from a really good manga.
Cooked,honestly though… it would cost her nothing to stay in her lane 🙃
Cooked,My theory is that she’s the only storm cloud in an otherwise sunny show and it creates a nice contrast.
Cooked,Would you say is it good enough for Netflix to cancel after first or second season?
Cooked,Friendship between two teen girls who decide to try to become geisha in modern Kyoto. Lots of cooking scenes. It’s an even more wholesome version of something like Midnight Diner.
Cooked,"My interpretation of that scene is that >!Sumire was extremely nervous before and throughout the dinner since it was her first dine out with a client as a maiko. She probably felt pressured and couldn't decide on what to order given it was her first time. Plus, the menu items were probably high-end dishes that she had never heard of or tried before. So she ultimately just went with what Momoko ordered too.!<"
Cooked,I’ve rewatched it twice already. Started the third just right now. It’s my comfort show now. Even with just one season. I keep hoping someone starts a subreddit.
Cooked,"You have ""First love"" in Netflix too. Similar calm, slice of life vibe (no maikos, though)."
Cooked,"Would You Like a Cup of Coffee? - kdrama on Netflix

Little Forest - movie adaptation on Amazon Prime"
Cooked,"If you liked The Makanai, you HAVE to watch Midnight Diner, it's on Netflix. It's about a very small, hole in the wall restaurant in Tokyo that's only open from midnight to morning. There are only three (I think) things on the menu, but the proprietor will make anything you ask for, if he has the ingredients. It's a lot like The Makanai but it explores more adult relationships and stories rather than coming of age stories. It's honestly one of my favorite shows that I've ever seen in my life."
Cooked,"Disagree. It's a completely light, platonic friendship. Not everything has to resort to that."
Cooked,"You're getting downvotes, but I'm pretty sure you're right. There's no heterosexual explanation for why Kiyo's so dedicated to cargo shorts that she wears them over tights in winter. 

My personal headcanon is that Kiyo's a baby gay who doesn't even realize it but is passionately in love with Sumire. Ryoko is fully aware that she has a crush on Kiyo, but is frustrated because she's still hung up on Sumire. Sumire's straight and oblivious to all the sapphic longing."
Cooked,"I definitely thought there was room for subtext here, what with the barkeep spouting about the strongest love being unrequited, but it also felt like Sumire was pining for her left-behind baseball friend in Aomori. I honestly couldn't decide if it was deliberate or not as the personal interplay and culture isn't the same as I'm used to in general, but it was a lovely, genuine relationship regardless of any romance in my opinion 🥰"
Cooked,Well luckily you can read the manga this is based on that has 200+ chapters.
Cooked,The first season feels like a complete story and can be enjoyed on its own.
Cooked,Do dramas usually use more than a season?
Cooked,"The Yoshino character doesn't bug me that much and as someone who has studied Film, I think Kore-eda did a beautiful job. The show is lighthearted and easy to follow. It's a celebration of the Maiko world with a blend of food..."
Cooked,"Shrug, I have a few Japanese gf's who remind me of Yoshino. It's similar with the ""overacting"" in Korea drama. After living and working in Korean culture for going on 10 years, women from 20-70 are often be that whiny, petty, and immature---I've seen it plenty of times (my MIL for example, lolol). Characters like that don't come from nowhere."
Cooked,"I hate Hoshino character too! You're not alone. 
Loved the rest of it though."
Cooked,[removed]
Cooked,[removed]
Cooked,"> the menu items were probably high-end dishes that she had never heard of or tried before

This I didn't think about. You're probably right. Thanks."
Cooked,Let me know if they do!
Cooked,I don’t think it was anything more than platonic either. I think Kiyo is just pure and sweet and a bit of a tomboy. She openly expresses her feelings with everyone and wears her heart on her sleeve. They are also compared to being sisterly in the show as well.
Cooked,"RIGHT?! Like, IDK if cargo shorts are the queer signifier in Japan that they are in the US, but if they are...

Ryoko also explicitly compares K and S's relationship to that of a romantic cishet relationship at one point late in the season, which felt like it kind of confirmed my suspicions. 

And then the line from Kiyo about going the long way home because she wants to look at the side of Sumire's face longer. It's all right there!"
Cooked,Sorry this Netflix show didn't add a gay character for no reason
Cooked,Well now we’re talking
Cooked,I don’t know how to respond to this question lol. Have you never seen a drama have 2+ seasons?
Cooked,"I know a few women and men like that, too. I lived in Japan for years and know several actresses. There was no nuance in the characterization."
Cooked,I'll give it another shot. I loved the first episode.
Cooked,"One hundred percent.

Kiyo reminds me of that happy, old grandma who always gives you the biggest smile to everyone, doesn't get offended nor does she offend.

Sumire is a typical demure but hardworking, goal-oriented darling. She puts all her effort in learning from her sisters, and let her work do the talking rather than running her mouth. 

Both of them share such a beautiful, timeless friendship that when you see it, you can feel that this purity has existed many times before you and long after you're gone, even though you don't experience it yourself. It just warms your heart."
Cooked,"I found the way Kiyo is given license to share non-sexual intimacy with Sumire really touching. If you’ve watched Terrace House: Opening New Doors, she’s super similar to Tsubasa, the sweet hockey player."
Cooked,"I don’t there there’s anything wrong as reading it as gay. I mean there’s a list of moments I think definitely could be read as having a romantic subtext: 

- How the bartender keeps talking about ‘unrequited love’ to Kiyo (Ryoko also mentioned it too)

- How Kiyo dotes on how pretty Sumrie is far more than a friend would (at least personally, I compliment my friends but not that much). Especially that scene where she talks about how she could look at the side of Sumries face all night long and they took the long way home so she could do so more.

- When mother and the sisters are talking about how Kiyo and Sumrie share such a deep love they really could be sisters, and one of the girls says “it’s more than that mother” and they give each-other a look but never explicitly say it’s romantic 

- How Kiyo puts Sumrie above everything and everyone else. Yes this could be just a strong friendship but the fact Kiyo prioritises Sumrie over herself a lot of the time suggest to me that it’s romantic because Kiyo’s main goal is to stay with Sumrie.

- How other people keep referring to them as an “old married couple” 

- Just the way Kiyo looks at Sumrie

To me as a bisexual woman I read it as wholesome gayness, which I found really refreshing, they’re just normal characters where their sexuality isn’t the focus of the show, it could just be part of who they are. 

Of course if you prefer to read it as platonic that’s fair. Plus, it’s subjective, it might just be because I’m a bisexual woman I’m more inclined to read it as romantic, whereas someone who’s not may read it as platonic. Personally I’m not that affectionate with my friends but would be with a romantic interest, other people are like that with their friends. There’s different ways to interpret it. That’s okay."
Cooked,Netflix casually dropping a series from a palme d'or winner with the most tepid marketing campaign
Cooked,"> music composed by Yoko Kanno

Say no more, I'm there."
Cooked,"the original comics the series is based on are so so wholesome and put me in a mood to cook like no other. if you’re a fan of manga and need something
lighter and more casual to read, definitely check it out if you can!!"
Cooked,I bought a few bottles of wine for this. Everything I’ve read makes it sound like the ultimate comfort show. Really looking forward to it.
Cooked,Reminds me of filmmakers like Kogonada doing Pachinko for Apple TV+. Koreeda is a modern master and I'll watch anything he makes.
Cooked,Damn netflix got Kore-eda? Gotta renew for a month
Cooked,Gonna binge it. Thanks reddit.
Cooked,Looks interesting
Cooked,Is this worth watching?
Cooked,So so happy i found this on my recommendation page.. surprised it even showed up seeing how limited french Netflix is!
Cooked,Isn't the maiko industry super predatory? Surprised he would make this.
Cooked,"One of my favourite movies is *Memoirs of a Geisha"" , so this definitely piques my interest."
Cooked,"the Japanese Geisha, to not be confused with Hungarian Geishas and Benghazi Gheishas"
Cooked,I loved this show!  Does anyone know what those things are she used to fry food?  Like long chopsticks with small tangs on the ends
Cooked,"Absolutely love this show, its such a different pace, and the cooking is excellent. I can't recall seeing a show that just flows along at such a genteel pace, the location and set decor are adorable, and seeing sweet characters warms my heart."
Cooked,"One thing I didn't get was in the finale: >!when the bartender hands Sumire a drink and says it's related to unrequited love. Who was he referring to? I got the impression Sumire liked that guy back home, but the bartender wouldn't have known that. Was he talking about her and Kiyo? I feel like I missed something. !<"
Cooked,"For real, i am a big kore-eda fan and had no idea about this project, just randomly seeing it posted here (thank god).  
Tbf though, it's not like the pamle d'or winners are big commercial successes usually, kore-eda isn't exactly a household name if one isn't into arthouse."
Cooked,it was marketed to everyone who watches similar stuff. Netflix does personal marketing right. It works really well tbh.
Cooked,Are we surprised at this point?
Cooked,Wow. They gotta lead with that
Cooked,The music is incredible
Cooked,NHK also turned the manga into a feel-good anime show.
Cooked,Have you been able to find the manga in English?
Cooked,"What time should we come over?

Will you have enough glasses or should everyone bring their own?"
Cooked,Kore-eda is a very big name and reviews are great so probably yes.
Cooked,"I'm down with covid, and binging on this. 100% worth it if it's the last thing I see. It's everything I like from an aesthetic, sweet, pacifying Japanese TV show."
Cooked,"It’s a very sweet and wholesome show about female friendship, at least through episode six. The crime is they don’t have recipes!"
Cooked,"I don’t think it is. At least not in recent decades. Do you have some reason to believe otherwise?

Edit to add: I’m not challenging you. Just curious to understand why you say that."
Cooked,Long cooking chopsticks are called saibashi.
Cooked,"I just created a new subreddit for the show. I’ve never been a mod before, but if you’re interested it’s r/TheMakanai"
Cooked,I usually drink straight out of the bottle. Can never find a corkscrew when I need one though
Cooked,"Found the post that I read recently

https://redd.it/vlmtlg"
Cooked,Thanks!
Cooked,I watched/read a lot about geisha when I was younger and most of the geisha interviewed seemed to be really positive about their experiences. Always admired the artistry part of the job (especially the dancing). This is a bummer to read. Hope the girl is in a better situation.
Cooked,"Hirokazu Kore-eda is such a fantastic filmmaker. If you love this show, I would highly recommend his movies. Especially Umimachi Diary, Shoplifters and Still Walking for the same quiet, lovely moments."
Cooked,"I really enjoyed the show. It’s so serene and comforting.

It’s also just exquisitely well-crafted. You can tell a lot of care went into the costumes, production design, cinematography, and the music, which is rare for a Netflix show, but shoutout to Hirokazu Kore-eda"
Cooked,"I’ve been recommending this show to everyone as it will easily fly under the radar. It’s the ultimate comfort show. I wonder how much was improvised- I love the scenes of them just sitting around talking. We don’t get enough of these slow paced, minimal conflict, feel good type shows, it’s really just the thing for winter."
Cooked,"This is my favourite show at the moment. My partner and I are savouring it only watching the last 3 episodes a week at a time.

Anyone with a stressful life or going through it, this show is pure joy and comfort."
Cooked,"This was on my radar when I heard that Kore Eda was involved with the project. Absolutely adored it. Every character is so charming.

Episode 8 was my favorite. >!We saw Momoko go to the Night of the Living Dead showing with that junior architect in an earlier episode. I figured that was going to be a one off and never mentioned again, save for the zombie paraphilia featured in the background of her apartment.!<

>!I was absolutely shocked and tickled to see that storyline brought back. Momoko is now trying to do a George Romero tribute performance with the students for that show. And then we get to see the practice performance! Had the biggest smile during that part.!<

I wish it wasn't a mini series. I'd love to see more stories in that household."
Cooked,"I am enjoying the show... But the sub titles are some of the laziest work that I have ever seen. So often they just use the Japanese pronunciations of the word instead of a proper translation. I understand many of them are food, or locations or religious terms. But without any translation we really struggle to keep up with the conversation."
Cooked,Are they on Netflix?
Cooked,"Not in my country! Maybe where you are. Or they might be able to rent somewhere online, or on some other streaming service. 

Add them to your to-watch-list if you have one! Sooner or later you will find somewhere to watch them! My watchlist is just hundreds of movies I’m just waiting to pop up on Netflix or one of my other streaming services."
Cooked,I'm envious of the people that were high as shit and watching adult swim when this first came on randomly at like 3am.
Cooked,It takes a lot to make a stew
Cooked,"The weird longform shorts were some of the best things Adult Swim did. One of my favorites is this infomercial for an online college:

Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Love,People are so stupid.
Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Love,Good. What a POS.
Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Love,What a gross thing to do.
Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Love,Good. Fucking loser
Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Love,Who and who?
Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
Love,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Love,Never heard of him.
Love,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Love,As he should. If not more…
Love,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
Love,[removed]
Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
Love,Nasty bastard
Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."

""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Love,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Love,What a douche.
Love,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Love,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Love,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
Love,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.

Love,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Love,Both of them are a waste of space
Love,And he published non-consensual photos and videos with his ex. So well deserved!
Love,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Love,"“I’m terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me”"
Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Love,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Love,He’s probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Love,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn’t already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Love,How do you know it was rented
Love,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I’m sure you’ll find your answer
Love,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Love,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Love,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Love,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so…"
Love,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Love,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Love,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Love,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Love,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Love,Which beckons the question why we’re giving them more publicity
Love,He’ll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Love,Holy shit that guy is huge
Love,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Love,The narcissistic wound in public format
Love,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Love,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt’s Creek.

“Eeew, David.”"
Love,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Love,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Love,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Love,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Love,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‘social media’ that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‘all in a house’ only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‘a career in being famous’ and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‘just in a house’ and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‘washed up’, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‘famous’.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They’re already ‘scene’ if they’re hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something’s who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That’s the point that it became clear ‘the kids’ make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Love,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Love,"Hilariously, I’m pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren’t becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there’s no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Love,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Love,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Love,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Love,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can’t be more masculine than that!"
Love,I can't find it
Love,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
Highway Thru Hell,"Alba is absolutely gorgeous, and reminds me of Ivana Baquero. With the exception of shotgun mary, the rest of the cast seem be right out of central casting, if your gonna want nuns. 

Having said that, I think I want to know more about the Mother Superiors backstory, she gave me that impression she was a hellcat back in the day. 

Give this serious high marks and waiting on season 2"
Highway Thru Hell,"Also, main character is such a brat"
Highway Thru Hell,That was not a season ending! An advert break at best...
Highway Thru Hell,"I cannot stand Ava, she is so selfish and hate to say this but she's so fucking ""quirky"" I forced myself to watch this but every episode the only good parts were where Ava was in pain or upset. She's so fucking selfish and just, I fucking hate her."
Highway Thru Hell,"Best moment: 
Beatrice kicks Ava off the ledge and goes camping. 

But the bitch came back, the very next daaaayyy"
Highway Thru Hell,"What annoyed me was all the american accents, when they are supposedly in spain and no back story to how americans all ended up in spain. Then throw in some random spanish and italian speech. Really annoying."
Highway Thru Hell,I enjoyed it.  I liked the chemistry of the cast and the nuns really kicked ass.  I hope it gets season 2.
Highway Thru Hell,I just saw the first episode and it is bad. Does it get better from there or is it the same?
Highway Thru Hell,"Episode 6, the town they hide out in. Does anyone know what town it was filmed in? It’s a beautiful town."
Highway Thru Hell,Has anyone noticed that Solid Snake wrote this show? I’m surprised no one caught it.
Highway Thru Hell,Based on ep. 1 Warrior Nun is one of the most pathetic series I've ever watched. I'm not going to continue.
Highway Thru Hell,How come an ancient Western order uses oriental martial arts?
Highway Thru Hell,MC is gorgeous but besides that the show was trash. Like who ends a season right before a fight?  Give us some content first then end it on a cliffhanger.
Highway Thru Hell,I had to come to this page just to say the main character is hella annoying. Hurts my head big time; but I was already 4 episodes in so had to finish. The rest was the same. Holy fuck she is annoying. She has been pampered by them and cries or says I don't know when something serious is brought up.
Highway Thru Hell,so many unanswered questions. like why did Adriel want the halo back since it attracts the tarsak?
Highway Thru Hell,"Yeah every time she smiled I forgave the rest of the show's mistakes just to bask in her glow. 

She almost had this apologetic gleam in her eye as she did it, as if she were saying

""I'm sorry that the writers are so terrible but hey isn't this funny? 
This little moment I have with you right now? Laugh, just go on and laugh with me""

And so  I found myself laughing and pressing next episode because of her."
Highway Thru Hell,she's extremely irritating and unlikable. no one wants to watch a kid run away from their problems for 5+ episodes
Highway Thru Hell,Agree.
Highway Thru Hell,"I was kind of annoyed by how she acts, but then I had to remember that she's been stuck in a bed almost her whole life and hasn't been able to interact with anyone outside of the nuns and Diego. So of course she's going to be ""off"" and socially awkward."
Highway Thru Hell,Best part of the whole show is when Beatrice kicks her off the ledge. Fucking great man
Highway Thru Hell,"You gotta remember she's been bed ridden almost her whole life with no interactions outside of nuns and that Diego kid. Of course she's going to be super fucking awkward and say and do dumb shit. If they made her totally normal, that would make no sense."
Highway Thru Hell,Everyone but Mary is European.
Highway Thru Hell,That confused me too but I guess the order and the Catholic Church specifically aren't Spanish and are just operating in Spain. With that said it’s really weird and confusing a British scientist would move to Spain to do inter dimensional research. I guess you could argue she did that to be close to order but she didn’t know it existed before hand.
Highway Thru Hell,[deleted]
Highway Thru Hell,"I get a ""no such place as Canada"" vibe."
Highway Thru Hell,"I somehow made it through.  Around I think episode 5 it starts to pick up.  It's really the last 4 episodes where it got me wanting more.

If you liked The Order, then I think you'll like the last half of the season.

Edit: It honestly feels like they filmed the second half of the show first and then after editing realized they needed 5 more episodes."
Highway Thru Hell,"The first few episodes are kind of teen drama-ish, but it picks up quick and the last few episodes go at a break neck speed. After season 1 finale I'm super interested in the lore and story, so I'm gonna look into that and probably spoil myself now."
Highway Thru Hell,"First half of the season, I'd say is a 4/10. Second half, 8/10, maybe even 9."
Highway Thru Hell,It gets better but that's not saying much.
Highway Thru Hell,"it looked to me like the city Ronda, near Granada, which would make sense given their general location of the south of Spain"
Highway Thru Hell,"Finally!! I saw David Hayter flash by after the first episode and I'm like wh-wh-what rewind.

I start seeing hideo kojima flashes in my head I'm like no way
It's gotta be some random guy but I looked it up and boom"
Highway Thru Hell,"your loss, i am amazed what a good series it turned out to be. waiting for s2 now."
Highway Thru Hell,"If you've read the book Lamb, you would know that Jesus was very proficient in ancient asian martial arts. So it would make sense that the warrior nuns would follow suit."
Highway Thru Hell,"Cos americans can do everything better than everyone else 




Obviously... /s"
Highway Thru Hell,"yes that is a problem with the program

The Guardian had an article saying ""is this the new stranger things?"" and I was like bitch please this is the new hemlock grove"
Highway Thru Hell,"I thought this was pretty relateable. Like, she just wants to live her own life and not live in constant worry that the OCS is going to strip away the Halo and possibly kill her."
Highway Thru Hell,"it's all true but I really don't care and the problem isn't just that she is thoroughly unlikeable - you don''t have to like the main character in a tv program, but you have to care about them

the other massive problem is that she has no agency, she just reacts all the time to situations - she is a passenger  in her own story. She occasionally knows what she doesn't want but she has no clear goals or any guiding principle, not even self-interest

She is the least interesting character in the story"
Highway Thru Hell,"The only part that I don't like is that they talk to her about the demon hunting her, kill her, her friends, and still she run way in episode 3 or 4..."
Highway Thru Hell,"I know the actors are european but the accents throw it off.
Probably would've been better if the series was primarily filmed in spanish"
Highway Thru Hell,She speaks and has facial expressions exactly like Omar Little. I had to google if she's his daughter
Highway Thru Hell,Thank you! Finally someone who gets it! the whole banterous personality just didn't seem to fit the seriousness of the plot and was even cringeworthy at points..
Highway Thru Hell,Absolutely nothing about your statement makes sense lol
Highway Thru Hell,well we're currently #1 right now at the covidlympics so you're not wrong.
Highway Thru Hell,"🤣 it's at least got a certain draw to it, it'd be horrible otherwise. But the main character is just so unlikable it makes it difficult. I got to e6 tho and it seems to be getting slightly better.

The forced romance between her and JC was awful though. I'm glad he's gone for now"
Highway Thru Hell,[deleted]
Highway Thru Hell," her fundamental unlikability is indeed a major stumbling block with the whole thing

tbf a quadriplegic teenage virgin who suddenly gets cured of paralysis plus being given superpowers after years of being bullied by a psychotic nun, and then immediately has five separate groups of people on her case (JC and his party people, the order of nuns, whatever interests the bent cardinal represents, the mad scientist and her crowd of thugs, and the forces of Hell itself) all trying to force their agendas on her could be excused for being a bit shitty and confused about it, but the trouble is I don't care about her AT ALL because she is fundamentally neither likeable nor interesting

the only admirable quality she shows is in going back to the orphanage for her friend but then that storyline doesn't really go anywhere

the other major problem is that she has no real agency, just ricochets all over the place wherever her hormones or other people's actions take her so it's not got the entertainment value it could have if they had invested her with a better back story - if they had given her access to the memories of previous incarnations via dreams or visions, she could have remembered stuff that we would have learned alongside her, and she could have led the action by going to recover some crucial magic item for example. This would have worked better than the rather tedious exposition scene with the friendly priest, because it would have advanced the action too. She needs to be in the centre of the story moving it forward with her own actions, she is not really the central character of the story as well as being not in anyway an attractive character

as it is there is no sense of growth on her part and there is no sense that she is anything other than a necessary asset for other people's games

I hate it frankly"
Highway Thru Hell,"Started watching Kim's Convenience, it's waaay better"
Highway Thru Hell,"Tbf for me the same goes for main character, Ava. The whole cringey joking about thing and internal monologue just put me off. Seems the script was a bit disjointed. Shame because I like the premise of the show."
Highway Thru Hell,"I agree wholeheartedly. I ranted pretty much the same exact thing to a friend of mine lol 

My main issue with her is the total lack of growth in the first five eps, she seems to regress and stagnate and it's frustrating. Seeing her on screen literally just irritated me, I disliked every scene with her in it because the plot just comes to a halt with her running away or engaging in some dumb teeny bop romance over and over"
Highway Thru Hell,Is that on Netflix??
Highway Thru Hell,"I have just started watching Kim's convenience which is so much better and has 4 back seasons

it's not a fantasy show, it's about family dynamics in a Korean Canadian family but it's well plotted, sympathetic characters and relatable situations
 
recommend it"
Highway Thru Hell,Its on UK Netflix
Highway Thru Hell,"It was unexpected, strange and fantastic. The way this show refuses to be pigeonholed makes it must see TV."
Highway Thru Hell,Was it 41 minutes?. It was only 35 for me.
Highway Thru Hell,I love when Atlanta leans into its more surrealist tendencies. 
Highway Thru Hell,"That was some truly crazy shit, I almost thought he was done for"
Highway Thru Hell,Top tier television.
Highway Thru Hell,This episode legit fucked me up.
Highway Thru Hell,"Its crazy to have a show, where every week you dont know what kind of show you will be getting. I know that turns off some people who just want a straight forward comedy, but this show seems like an anthology, that happens to have the same characters in every episode."
Highway Thru Hell,"It’s 10/10 for me. It’s the definition and pinnacle of gripping television. Best comedy, best horror. "
Highway Thru Hell,"I feel dumb for not realising that it was Donald Glover who was playing Teddy Perkins. Regardless, what a performance from him. That scene where he shouts at Darius scared the shit out of me. Also, anyone know who played Benny?"
Highway Thru Hell,Every week this show impresses. 
Highway Thru Hell,I haven't been legitimately worried about a character in a show for a while. Really loved this episode.
Highway Thru Hell,Donald Glover is a waaaaaaay fucking better actor than I thought...and I've always thought he was a great one.
Highway Thru Hell,"That was fucking incredible. I couldn't keep my eyes off it the whole time. Never in a million years did I think this show would ever do anything like this but I'm pretty sure it's already one of my favorite TV episodes ever.

And I guessed that Donald played Teddy within like two minutes lol, I recognized his voice and then noticed the similar facial features and especially mannerisms. It was actually an incredible performance from him and I hope the shock of him playing the character doesn't distract from that


Goddamn I love this show "
Highway Thru Hell,Fucking incredible episode of television. Right up there with Ozymandias and International Assassin. This is some David Lynch type shit
Highway Thru Hell,"there were many nuances to this week's episode. 

Firstly, the Confederate Flag and it's social meaning to the black community being parodied with the ""U Mad"" dig ala Cam'ron. I thought this was hilarious. 

Donald Glover (I'm presuming) doing white face which is in itself a head turner that again touches on social commentary that also goes with the comedic aspect of the series. Obviously it was a dig at Michael Jackson, that is probably touching on his later years. 

The cameras shot was the most Twin Peaks thing this show has done yet. The slow pace and slow burns with the ambient piano that plays through the episode is in the vein of Lynch.

The comedic break I thought was necessary. There wasn't any commercials, but this was an intermission of sort. Still commenting on the culture, for lack of a better term. And still nailing the sarcastic witty writing and character development of paperboy in a few minutes.
 
In between the sammy sosa commentary, did anyone notice Darius' iPhone wallpaper? Along with the dig at hiphop earleir, I think the writers are probably trying to say something, but I really can't figure it out right now.

In the latter part of the episode, like you said, we see Darius grow even more. Last season when Earn and D went through their adventures to get the dogs, at the end we see a understanding side of Darius. Now, we see a childhood of tough parenting and resentment that shaped Darius into who he is. His monologue apologizing for his own actions against his uprising continue that growth.

Personally, I'm impressed and excited for what's to come. This is the most Lynch/Twin Peaks episode, I know I'm repeating that but I'm amazed how strongly they've nailed that sort of television, it's not easy. I don't want to take anything away from them, they're doing it in their own style that is just incredible to watch. 
The acting by lakeith stanfield was top notch and needs to be praised. He just continues to impress not only in Atlanta but in everything he does.
"
Highway Thru Hell,"For the first half of the episode I thought Darius was there to buy LSD from Teddy Perkins (intro via a biohacking forum that people don't use real names on, 'piano with the colored keys' sounds like code for something, episode description 'Darius trips"", etc) and that Teddy Perkins being a manufacturer/connoisseur of LSD explained his weirdness.

I was very surprised when they showed an actual piano with colored keys."
Highway Thru Hell,So I guess it’s an Emmy episode for writing acting direcitng
Highway Thru Hell,"I was on the edge of my seat, best suspense ""film"" I've seen in a while."
Highway Thru Hell,It was so uncomfortable but I just couldn't look away. It was great. Definitely one of the best episodes of a show I have seen in sometime.
Highway Thru Hell,I needed a drink after that episode. Holy shit that was heavy
Highway Thru Hell,"Definitely adding my voice to the ""incredible, must-see TV"" crowd. This will stand tall as one of the very best episodes of any show all year."
Highway Thru Hell,"It was amazing, and I think the show was a lot more sympathetic towards the Teddy character than most people are giving credit. It's really analyzing the place of love for our ambition and drive, and that so many people grow up without ever feeling that love from their parents and where that can lead someone if they never feel loved.  It's such a tragedy.  I think the ending stevie song was perfect and summed it all up

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUM3YSvUjjM "
Highway Thru Hell,"I'll provide a different perspective, I really didn't enjoy it at all.

I love this show and this season has been top notch but for me, this episode was a misfire. It was creepy as hell, overlong, pointless, and off putting. Now, I don't believe that this episode is any sort of make or break moment, it changes nothing of how I view the show, but it was definitely one that I would like to forget a soon as possible.

Coming off of last week's amazing episode and knowing we were getting a long uninterrupted episode with Darius at the center, I was super excited and even the opening was great but the rest fell flat.

Im glad you enjoyed it, but it was not for me at all. Looking forward to next week. "
Highway Thru Hell,This is the best TV show on right now.
Highway Thru Hell,It was a very well done episode but what was the point of it all? What was the payoff?
Highway Thru Hell,Huh... well that didnt end anything like I thought it would. 
Highway Thru Hell,The egg scene was one of the funniest and most awkward scenes I’ve seen.  Such great dialogue.  Darius trying to figure out exactly who he’s dealing with is fascinating to witness.  He’s as intrigued as he is a little unnerved.  Pure gold.
Highway Thru Hell,"Truly one of the best episodes of TV I have seen in a long, long time. "
Highway Thru Hell,"Donald Glover is a fucking acting legend... If he doesn't at least get an Emmy nomination for acting for this episode, then there is no justice in the world.  I had no clue he was such a great character actor."
Highway Thru Hell,"There are only a few episodes of TV that I will watch multiple times, much less back-to-back-to-back. I did this last night with ""Teddy Perkins"" because it was so damn good and revealed new things to me each time. I also just reveled in all the lines hearing them again. From top to bottom, the acting, the directing, the dialogue, the cinematography, the soundtrack - this episode was masterful and still makes me kind of scared"
Highway Thru Hell,Yooo I'm about to watch this again and analyze the mess out of it. Anyone else catch that reference to Get Out when Teddy took Lakeith's photo and he said he wasn't a big photo person? Also the scene with Paperboi at the drive thru felt important because one of the points i think they're trying to make in this season is how life changes once you reach fame status.   Seeing paperboi in the drive thru with his boys still not getting what he ordered seemed like a subtle but intentional message imo.
Highway Thru Hell,"Atlanta is such a mixed bag, I'm more inclined to believe it's a bad episode that is so on the nose different that you just want to like because as you say from the 1st line you're a big Donald fan. Seems to me like most are less critical of it because of this, the 4th episode where he goes to the German festival is one of the worst of anything I've seen period. "
Highway Thru Hell,I’ll never watch this show just because Reddit has made me despise Donald Glover
Highway Thru Hell,"I think it's a hugedrawback of it, some episodes you're gonna just despise and not want to come back and at any instance they can pull out 30 mins completely irrelevant to anything going on in the show and miss the mark completely. It's trying way too much for me"
Highway Thru Hell,Me too. Watched it live too. 
Highway Thru Hell,Cuz you torrented it
Highway Thru Hell,"Damn, I was so confused. My episode description on the TV just said ""Darius be trippin'."" I know other people said ""Darius be trippin, better believe I woulda left"" or something like that. 



I tuned in just a minute or 90 seconds late and was watching the trailer for the movie Darius is in. Then it transitioned to the episode, so I spent the longest time thinking that Darius was just literally on a bad trip and none of this was happening."
Highway Thru Hell,How fucking dim am I that I just finished the episode not realising it was Glover in whiteface?
Highway Thru Hell,[deleted]
Highway Thru Hell,Man I know it's hard to compare comedy and drama but how does a one off episode compare to the culmination of everything coming down in the case of Breaking Bad? What made this the best of television for you?
Highway Thru Hell,Holy shit this guy names tv shows by their individual episode names!
Highway Thru Hell,"> The comedic break I thought was necessary. There wasn't any commercials, but this was an intermission of sort. Still commenting on the culture, for lack of a better term. And still nailing the sarcastic witty writing and character development of paperboy in a few minutes.

Loved the text ""U dead yet?"""
Highway Thru Hell,"I read in the episode discussion thread on /r/AtlantaTV that someone thought “Teddy” symbolized a generational disconnect with today’s music. “Teddy” represented a tortured artist (Michael Jackson/Marvin Gaye) from an older generation who thought enduring through pain enhanced greatness and brought maturity to the music. He even makes a comment at the beginning about how he thought “rap music never got past its juvenile state”. Ultimately this idea falls through when “Teddy” admits this was all an elaborate attempt to stage a double murder from a home invasion just so he and his “brother” could escape from the pain caused by the father.

I used the quotations because there’s also another theory on the same thread that “Teddy” is actually Benny the musician and the “brother” is actually the abusive father, which ties into the Marvin Gaye tragedy.

I’ll be shocked if this episode doesn’t get an Emmy nomination. This was the stand out for me so far unless they come up with something else.

Edit: I think the bleached skin either represented “Teddy” trying to escape being black since he associated it with the abuse caused by his father who thought that his son had to work harder in order to become accepted by white people or it could just represent him wanting to conform.  It also looked like the brother/father had bleached skin too if you pay attention to his wrists so it could be leaning more towards the latter.  The only reason why I think “Teddy” was trying to escape his blackness is because of the trauma associated with it which ties to his comment about rap earlier.  I think that “Teddy” thought being considered too *juvenile* meant being too *black* but this could be a far reach."
Highway Thru Hell,Did you mean nuances?
Highway Thru Hell,[Link to Darius' wallpaper](https://instagram.com/p/BfhOgDUHDwQ/?utm_source=ig_embed)
Highway Thru Hell,"The wallpaper with black cultural icons? I think it had the Obamas, Michael Jordan, Black Panther, Kanye maybe and a host of others."
Highway Thru Hell,"I agree with some of your takes but then to start with saying there's great nuances and firstly mention the very obvious ""u mad"" I laughed"
Highway Thru Hell,Was it Donald Glover playing Teddy? On IMDB it says it was someone else
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Spider-Man cameo
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I wasn’t able to catch this season before the first few episodes disappeared from the CW app. My hope the show returns to the present Arrowverse timeline and settles down for a bit for some character stuff. The ‘verse stuff happening on S&L is really interesting and it’d be fun to fold in the Legends for something related to that. But also just let the characters have a moment to breathe and maybe deal with incoming threats UNIT style
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,How was the last season? I had been a big fan but have kind of fizzled out of the Arrowverse over Covid tbh.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"With this show you never really know what you are going to get because it's pretty much anything goes. The few times I was able to predict what was going to happen was when I thought, ""What would be the most absurd thing to do here?"" 

It's wild to think that we have zero original members from the first crew of season one in this season. Sara is a alien-hybrid clone! The original Sara is mushroom food."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,To be entertained! But that's never really a problem with this show!
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"They're still off doing their own thing, not much arroverse shit in it"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Season 6 was probably the worst season since season 1, but season 7 has been a huge return to form. It has been really fun."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,it comes on N march 10th
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,its good but im glad john left he was a dick to everyone and had to much attention and supernaturel stuff
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Even Gideon isn't the same xD
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Wait, what?"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Constantine being a schmuck is just him being comic book accurate. He's good for his own show and I liked his run for Legends but he's a bad influence for the Waverider.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Last season.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,he wasnt made for an esemble show
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Haven’t watched this since season 2. Looking a lot like Doctor who these days.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This show is brilliantly stupid and amazing for it.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Okay I only saw a few episodes of the first season.........I think I might’ve missed a few steps
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Writers: do all the drugs and make that trailer

me: WTF is going on and yet I’m intrigued.

Probably because I don’t know what I’m getting and they at least understand that CW shows can be corny."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"I'm in to see them get animated at least. 

A bit sad that the dude who plays Mick left. I wonder if that means he'll get killed off partway through the season."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,ALL HAIL BEEBO!
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,As someone that only watched season 1... what?
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I don't recognize these shows anymore. Like the Flash. I wish they would put this on HBO Max as I can't take the CW app any longer and I don't get the CW where I live.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Going straight Doom patrol
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I quit the show after the main villain was a giant Furby. I see nothing's changed...
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"You really need to watch.  Season 3 is when the writers cut loose and just decided to make the show as funny and weird as possible.  You wouldnt recognize it.  Like you I gave yo after season 2 but then somewhere in the time near the end of season 4 I decided to give season 3 a go on Netflix and couldnt believe it was the same show.  Its brilliantly stupid as I said in another post but that's why it's awesome.

For example there is a talking doll named Beebo that is basically a blue tickle me Elmo.  One gets transported back in time to the Viking era and a tribe of Vikings begin worshiping it as a God because it talks saying ""Beebo Loves You"" or worst case ""Beebo Mad.""  Zaniness ensues."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,oh yea definitely. show is much better for it. One of my fav comfort shows
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"It always felt a little Doctor Whoish to me. With a time traveller appearing to take people through different times, and the Time Masters running everything.

But they've really ramped up the silliness, cheesy CGI and puppet monsters, etc. Insane show. This season looks fun. Also looks like Jonah Hex might show up.

Really intrigued about the animated episode. Looks like they're going to do stuff they probably couldn't do in live action that seems similar to stuff seen in some DC animated films."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"It's like 40% Doctor Who, 30% Buffy, 25% Power Rangers and only like 5% DC at this point haha."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Season 1 is garbage. 2 and 3 are great. Recent seasons have been just ok but they have Constantine who is awesome.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Around some point in season 2 they decided they wanted to be more zany then the rest of the Arrowverse. Then I’m season 3/4 they said “Fuck it this is a comedy”
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Heres what happened.  Season 1 they tried to conform the show into the same mold as the other shows.  It didn't work.  For Season 2, they basically just said ""fuck it"" and started having fun.  Introduced new characters, brought in a trio of villains that are actually fun to watch and most importantly got rid of the boring ass captain hunter.  Putting the idiots in charge of the time machine is just better.  Season 2 is my favorite season, and I highly suggest you just start from there."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Go watch episode 1 of season 3. It's a pretty accurate indicator of what the show will be like going forward.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"You didnt miss any steps, the Legends missed a few steps.

Or more like missed the staircase.  And the house.  And now, the county line."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"I think what separates this from the other CW shows is that it's fun. It's not overly dramatic or angsty, or hyperfocused on who's banging who, or trying to push any social messages. It's just...fun. Reminds me a lot of Supernatural, and the sillier episodes were some of my favorites (the channel surfers, Scooby crossover, etc)."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,He said he'll appear in Season 7 but only part-time/recurring.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,By the looks of it his Daughter is pregnant. Possibly just giving him a family ending
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Shit got weird
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Appropriate, as I think live action Doom Patrol would not have gotten off the ground if Legends wasn't such a hit for DC."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,The giant Furby was the hero
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Praise Beebo!
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"> With a time traveller appearing to take people through different times, and the Time Masters running everything.

And said time traveller was played by Arthur Darvill, who was Rory in Doctor Who. And his costume as Rip Hunter was similar the to Tenth Doctor's outfits."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I fucking loved season 5.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"> brought in a trio of villains that are actually fun to watch

I think Merlyn was much more fun here than he was on Arrow. Loved how he kept on being the most rational villain with just wanting to kill all the good guys rather than keeping them around to mess with them. It's rare when you have actual smart villains like that in these superhero shows. It's like, *Fine, guys, you can gloat but gloat over their graves.*"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Thing is, there are a ton of social messages on this show. The difference is Legends is character driven rather than plot driven. So, if a plot makes someone like Sarah feel out of character, they'll scrap that plot and go for something else rather than make Sarah just do it. But because everything fits around who a character is, you can do social commentary without it feeling like social commentary. You can have characters across the sexual spectrum and they don't feel like gold badges that say, ""Look at how progressive this show is!"" because they are allowed to be fleshed out people rather than props for writers. Legends is the only show that really does this. Every other CW cape show is plot driven. So, it can feel heavy handed at times when they do social commentary."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"It feels like they've not known what to do with Mick for a while now anyway, they could genuinely be setting up his daughter to take over or just give him the happy family ending."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This. Is. True.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,It was the villain in the last episode of Crisis
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Same
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Well, yes, this is what I meant. I should've worded it more as ""they don't try to cram social messages down people's throats"". I think the key is that character driven tends to help make progressive themes and social commentary feel more natural, and less forced."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"It wasn’t the main villain of the episode, or even the scene"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,It was a hologram conjured up by a time traveling magician as a distraction.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"A joke that needs to be explained isn’t funny but here goes .. since he said he quit when the villain is giant Beebo, I was just poking fun at him that he actually watched the most recent season ..."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Maybe , but it sure is the only thing I could be bothered to remember from the episode though."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"...okay I need to get back into this show, lmao"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Sounds like you weren't actually watching the show so quitting didn't mean much
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Lol how did you even get that? I wasn’t the one who post about quitting after Beebo. In fact I love Beebo! It was the best part of an otherwise forgettable conclusion to Crisis of Infinite Earth, and about the most ( or only ) Legendy thing in what’s supposed to be their part of the Crisis arc. 

That episode was such a wasted opportunity."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,[removed]
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Needs more Bebo.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"That's right, this used to be a superhero show."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,And it barely even acknowledges it's in the DC universe (with the amount of characters in the cast they've replaced with cheaper OC-made ones)
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,It's like the writers combed through the arrow and flash subreddits and created a TV show to please them 
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,CW is basically DC's TV channel now. How did they miss out on *Supergirl*? 
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"I'm so, so happy to see Caity Lotz back again."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Looks promising but I don't know how they will handle Firestorm and Atom's CGI for a whole season and possibly more seasons with the budget they have.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"I love it when superheroes assemble on rooftops. It's cheesy, I know, but I don't care. It's a classic comic book thing and it beats having them sit around a conference table or crammed in a basement lair or something. On the rooftop, they get space to stand a little too far apart, like rock stars on the album cover of a music supergroup.

I look forward to the many rooftops and rooftop meetings that this show will hopefully feature."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This is the most absurd thing I've ever seen on live-action television and I love it.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Vandal Savage! This is gonna be awesome!
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,[Eobard Thawne in the house](http://i.imgur.com/1ALGZCL.png)
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"This looks fucking awesome. Also, I have a huge grin on my face every time Wentworth Miller shows up. I've seen some people say he's over acting in the role but I legitimately love how he's doing Captain Cold."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,[deleted]
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Man, that is a really good trailer. Hits all the right kinda of cheese and awesome comic-book themes all at once. The intro portion was a bit weird, though I imagine that's more for the First Look than an episode.

The ending though! Been waiting all Arrow season for that!"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"[Aw that is adorable](http://i.gyazo.com/33861b148188ef454f87b2c3b9ea9a7a.png)  
Seriously though this looks amazing no matter how cheesy it was."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"THIS LOOKS AWESOME, I'm curious how they convince Cold to be a good guy but Savage as the villain? HELL YEAH!  I'm not expecting Mad Men levels of acting but this looks like it will be fun as hell to watch.  Can't wait to see what kind of shrinking shenanigans they get Atom involved in.  "
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This looks great but with such a story line..how the hell is Booster Gold not in this??
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"I just hope the drama from Flash and Arrow doesn't follow into this new series. I'm a little tired of the ""I don't like being lied to"" bit. **fingers crossed**"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,[deleted]
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Is it just me or the people who makes TV trailers stepped up their game?
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Sarah's  Lazarus Pits scene.....ohhh my
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"This looks.....AWESOME! And 2016 makes it seems like it'll have a short season, as The 100 did, which is perfect. "
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This is going to be amazing. I did not expect the trailer to come out this soon.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Now THIS is something I can get behind! I fucking LOVE the way Wentworth Miller plays Captain Cold, so I would check this out just because of him.

I have high hopes for this one."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,HE SHRINKS! HE FUCKING SHRINKS! TV Atom is officially the love child of Iron Man and Ant Man!
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Holy shit! Hunter is [Rory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCJX9SEif88) . Nice to see Arthur Darvill doing well. Edit: wrong Darvill
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"This looks so cool! The atom shrinking, time traveling team ups, and a resurrected canary! So much cool stuff to look forward too."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I didn't realize Rev. Paul Coates was also playing Rip Hunter. The hype increases even more.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I have the biggest hero boner right now.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Sara lives... But RIP Canary Cleavage :'(
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Wondering how they will keep Cold and Heatwave on the leash. Last time did not work so well.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"This is super cheesy, right?"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"So happy to get Sarah back! Also, Hawkgirl is going to kick ass. I can feel it. "
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Oh thank fuck he shrinks 
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,A lot more consistent than the Supergirl trailer
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"Just want to point out they included a shot from The Flash's Finale episode.  Reverse Flash in a chair with a time portal opening up in front of him, never seen that before."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"No signs of Felicity, this show is already better than S03 of Arrow."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,I'm definitely getting worried that these guys are spreading themselves too thin. The Arrow finale last night was seriously underwhelming and cheesy. I hope they don't sabotage Arrow completely just because they're trying to milk all these spin-offs from it.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"OK that was pretty rad. If I marathon Arrow & Flash do I catch up with everyone, or are there other shows as well?"
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,Why is this the first time I have heard about this? It looks awesome  I am actually kind of mad 
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,"This looks campy as hell.

I love it."
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This dialogue was just ridiculously forced.
DCs Legends of Tomorrow,This looks goofy as fuck - and I love it.
Chelsea Does,"I was never really a fan of Chelsea's show on E! and my girlfriend never really was either, but we are two episodes deep into this series and really enjoying it. 
I'm finding it pretty funny and I like the casual nature to this documentary series. From what I have read her late night series that's coming to Netflix later this year will be pretty informed by the style of this documentary series.
Definitely makes me more excited for that show.
I'd say give it a shot. "
Chelsea Does,"The drugs one was good, in my opinion. They're just little documentary style explorations and I think she's an excellent host for this style. I'd watch more"
Chelsea Does,"I, personally, don't like her style or a lot about the personality she portrays on camera. But I ended up watching all four episodes last night and loved it. Everyone does a great job talking about the issues in each episode from all angles (not what I expected) and she doesn't undermine them as much as she does in her usual acting."
Chelsea Does,"What really makes it work is that she's already very outspoken, open and honest about her life, which just makes the documentary format seem very natural for her. I'd say it's well worth checking out even if you're not a fan of her, none of it feels at all staged or forced and it's interesting seeing the topics addressed seen from her point of view."
Chelsea Does,"The Silicon appeared the weakest from it's description, but winded up being the funniest hands down. One thing that's good about the series is how transparent Chelsea is, although her schtick does gets old after a while. Loved her comment ""Even smart people like him can be racist."""
Chelsea Does,I just finished the race episode and think it was extremely well done. 
Chelsea Does,Definitely! Loved it from start to finish.
Chelsea Does,If you like watching her talk about herself and all the dumb shit she's put herself through... Then yes. 
Chelsea Does,Watched all four episodes and really liked the show. The marriage one was a little slow but the the other three were very entertaining.   From the current star ratings it would appear to be one of the worst things Netflix has put up. I don't get it.
Chelsea Does,"You're already paying for it. If you don't like it, move on. The sunk cost has already been made. "
Chelsea Does,"It was boring, I turned it off."
Chelsea Does,"Only if you like Chelsea, which I don't so I am not wasting me time with it.  Some love her and others don't, I guess.... There are other shows on Netflix i would rather watch..."
Chelsea Does,"Wife and I watched the Drugs and Racism ones this weekend. 

Drugs was fantastic. 

Racism was good too but I disagree with the level of hostility she showed some people. A little too, self flagelating. 

Still, can't wait for the other two. "
Chelsea Does,It's four episodes...
Chelsea Does,"A late night show on Netflix?

I'm confused as to how that's going to work "
Chelsea Does,It's actually eye opening especially the racism part. My mom hates chelsea and is rascist and enjoyed the topics she explored and came to understand why I have always been offened by her(my mother) views. 
Chelsea Does,Pointless comment. Shut up.
Chelsea Does,So you're recommending OP not watch it because YOU dont like chelsea handler. Pointless comment.  
Chelsea Does,It seems the antagonism was the only real way to get people to talk frankly.  It was a necessary evil for the Southerners.  
Chelsea Does,"4 and 1/2 hours i could be spending catching up on House Of Cards,South Park,The Leftovers and some other shows,or watching other movies,or playing BO3,or hanging out with friends,working out. there is way too much stuff out there to waste time on something not worth it"
Chelsea Does,Yeah I used late night show because that's the best euphemism I could. Don't think it'll be quite a talk show. Apparently it'll be 3 episodes a week from what I was reading. I imagine it'll just be released that day and not confined to being released at 11-12 at night or something.
Chelsea Does,"fuck, the irony in posting that to a 6 day old comment. "
Chelsea Does,"Laughs, I said if he likes her, watch it, if not, don't. If he has never seen her, check it out.  "
Chelsea Does,"I love how working out was last on your mind, same man"
Chelsea Does,I'm pretty sure you'll know if you like it or not in the first ten minutes.
Chelsea Does,"I don't know what it is about Chelsea Handler, but she annoys the hell out of me. "
Chelsea Does,I don't see TJ Miller or Thomas Middlebitch.  How is this Silicon Valley?
Chelsea Does,"Show is called ""Chelsea Does"" and i guess episode is Silicon valley. So nothing to do with that show "
Chelsea Does,I agree. 
Chelsea Does,"We watched the episode with Gwen Stefani thinking it was the first episode, since that was the one that popped up as were preparing to eat. We really enjoyed the format and Chelsea does a good job with her comedic timing throughout the show. 

We then went back and watched the first episode. We also thought highly of it but I understand how it could turn some people off as she came off as overly arrogant and talked over the guests. 

The show has definitely gotten better as Chelsea becomes more comfortable."
Chelsea Does,"I'm a fan
I think it will get better once Chelsea figures out the show a bit more and once she starts interviewing more people who aren't her friends. My favorite Chelsea segments have been when she's interviewing someone who is a guest (Tony Hale, the cast of Captain America, even Wanda Sykes to a degree) rather than her famous friends (Drew Barrymore, Gwyneth Paltrow)"
Chelsea Does,Stop trying to make 'Chelsea' happen
Chelsea Does,She already has happened and will continue happening.
Chelsea Does,"She reminds me of a drunken, unpleasant aunt that nobody likes, but always shows up to family gatherings, making everyone uncomfortable until she finally staggers away, causing everybody to breathe a sigh of relief."
Chelsea Does,"Yea she sucks. I feel like her and a couple of other female comedians (like Amy Schumer) have their comedy revolve around crude sex jokes. Not sure if that is just me forming a quick opinion from what little I have seen of them, or if that really is their whole act. "
Chelsea Does,"I love her and her show. Always have and probably always will. I don't really know exactly why, but I do."
Chelsea Does,"Tits. She gets her tits out and then posts pictures of it.

Greatest marketing ploy since Saturday."
Chelsea Does,I ask the same question about Margaret Cho
Chelsea Does,Self centered assholes make me laugh. It's that simple. 
Chelsea Does,"Years ago when she had a show on E! (i think) I was kind of a fan, mostly because I was watching over my younger brother's shoulder. I think after that show ended (by the way that show was probably much better than her Netflix gigs, although I havent seen those) my brother stopped watching her until recently, he told me about some super racist thing she did interviewing a bunch of asians and I realized two things.

1) My brother is probably racist, but for some reason mostly towards asians. (I have since confirmed this)

2) Chelsea is for trash people. Really, that's it. Her humor is offensive for the sake of being offensive, and there are a shit ton of other comics out there like her but she cares about her image even less than those people. She's absurdly insane and inappropriate. She's high off the thousands of people that have used her twisted life for their entertainment and she enjoys being a mess on television. Obviously she's self centered and that's why her show's entirely about her. And I think she's one of very few female comics who don't push the ""PC"" agendas that her target audience hates."
Chelsea Does,"Her show used to be pretty good, but just because her round-table would include some funny comedians like Natasha Leggero, Heather McDonald, Josh Wolf, TJ Miller...


But I completely agree with you; her comedy is all derived from her being crude and irreverent. Thinking she's the wildest, craziest woman in America because she's a bad role model, yet an empowered and independent woman.


But that's yesterday's thing. Saying ""fuck"" on television isn't edgy anymore; being a drunk and using drugs is the norm nowadays, it doesn't make you the ""wild one"". Yet there are several really funny comediennes who would do a way better job with those Netflix shows...."
Chelsea Does,"Chelsea handler is vile, crass and offensive. To answer your question, she has slept with prominent network  figures which is why she’s still around. She is an embarrassment to women."
Chelsea Does,"I've never been a fan of her comedy. I rank her with Amy Schumer -- once in a while, there will be funny bits, but for the most part their comedy is ""I'm a slutty lush, hahahaaa."" No thanks, I'll stick to Lisa Lampanelli for my female comedy."
Chelsea Does,It's for us dumb folk
Chelsea Does,Same thing with Schumer. I think the media just needs to have a person filling that niche. Schumer did absolutely nothing and became a household name like overnight.
Chelsea Does,"Whenever I'd catch her old show on E!, I'd find myself thinking at least once an episode that she seemed terribly rude. To her guests, to her panel...and not in a way that was funny, just cringey. She's got her funny moments, but picking on and talking over people all the time isn't comedy."
Chelsea Does,"Probably the same reason why certain groups of people enjoy shows on Spike TV or the Real Housewives series.  People have a range of tastes and what someone finds amusing you may not.  While I didn't find shows like Friends and Seinfeld funny, I found Curb your Enthusiasm and How I Met Your Mother to be really good.  I can take a step back and appreciate those shows since a large part of the population enjoyed them.  For the 50k to 250K people watching Chelsea, I hope they enjoy her.

Her late night talk show did do a really good job of getting some comedians airtime that they normally would not have gotten.  Late night used to be great to find funny interviews but with Craig Ferguson, Leno, and Letterman having stepped down the art of the interview is temporarily lost."
Chelsea Does,"I know this is will be a shock to you but not everything is created for your particular entertainment there are other people on this planet with different taste and preference. The world does not revolve around you, SHOCKING.   "
Chelsea Does,"Her interview on Marc Maron's podcast ""WTF"" was interesting. She treated Maron rather poorly. Considering he's a good guy and great interviewer, I was hoping for a better showing on her part. Ah, well, disappointment."
Chelsea Does,And nonstop gossiping about it when she leaves. Up exactly.
Chelsea Does,that’s all you came up with?
Chelsea Does,Hey Chelsea.
Chelsea Does,"Yep same, must be an Aussie thing"
Chelsea Does,Wait what? She is a total liberal boob. 🤣
Chelsea Does,"But Lampanelli does the exact same shit, her whole act is being crude and loving black guys."
Chelsea Does,What an unnecessarily rude comment. OP was asking for other people's perspectives which is totally valid.
Chelsea Does,They can also be super racist and they're even more ignorant of it because they believe their liberal ideas are a shield from being racist but they're not
Chelsea Does,"It's the most important perspective, he clearly has no insight on how or why things are made or advertised, just like tampon commercials are not aimed at men neither is Chelsea Handler.  "
Chelsea Does,Sort of fell off in season 3 but still really good
Chelsea Does,"Should’ve stayed a miniseries/1 season with the downfall of the family being condensed. Ben Mendelsohn as Danny was far and away the best part of the show and killing him off felt more like a way to be shocking than thinking of telling future stories. The creators said before Netflix cancelled the show that they had a 6 season plan, which seems ridiculous considering the show was spinning its wheels in season 2."
Chelsea Does,"Absolutely great show. Probably one of the best on Netflix right now. It would be easy to write it off as a soap opera, but the exploration of the characters and their convoluted motivations goes very deep. Great cast and great writing with some truly sublime performances resulting.

Fully agree on Ben, but it's hard to pick a favorite. The Kevin character is a great example of a character that I really want to hate but the show drags me onto his side."
Chelsea Does,Great series with a really stellar cast. Sissy Spacek didn't get nearly enough recognition for her performance. I remember watching her in this and then in Castle Rock and thinking how she really deserved an Emmy nomination for at least one of the performances.
Chelsea Does,"First season = Excellent 

Second season = meh

Third season = Un-fucking-watchable"
Chelsea Does,"I watched first season and it was excellent

I stopped there because I learned to quit while I'm ahead"
Chelsea Does,Really liked the first 2 seasons and heard the 3rd season fell off a cliff. Is it that bad?
Chelsea Does,"First season was *amazing*, second one was pretty good, and I would rather forget the third one even existed."
Chelsea Does,"Danny is one of my favourite charcters in anything ever. The complexity is brilliant, he's the victim, the villain, the humour, the mystery all at the same time. Ben absolutely nailed it. 

The slow burn of tension building throughout the first season was done extremely well, and the setting in the Keys really gave this series it's own feel compared to others.

As everyone else has already said, it declined after season 1, but season 1 is up there with the all-time greats for me."
Chelsea Does,"It is in my watchlist, but i read somewhere that the ending is pretty bad, which ended up discouraging me to start."
Chelsea Does,"It was fantastic. Loved Mendelssohn, he acted the shit out of that roll. 

I was so disappointed when they cancelled it mid-season 3 and they had to tie up every loose end in the quickest and most illogical and poorly characterized way. I felt sorry for the showrunners  l don’t blame them, they had to end it somehow."
Chelsea Does,"I love Bloodline but it is not underrated, especially the first season. It was HIGHLY acclaimed and praised by critics. It was also nominated for numerous awards."
Chelsea Does,"I only watched season one. Overall it’s very good, but it could’ve been perfect if it was 8-10 episodes. There’s just a bit too much filler that ends up dragging the show.

But holy shit the performances are great 
."
Chelsea Does,"I only watched season one. Overall it’s very good, but it could’ve been perfect if it was 8-10 episodes. There’s just a bit too much filler that ends up dragging the show.

But holy shit the performances are grear."
Chelsea Does,"Could you remind me how their mother found out John killed Danny and the others covered it up? And what the fallout was?

I rewatched the first season a while back but have zero interest in doing the same for the other two."
Chelsea Does,"I watched the first three episodes and didn't feel like continuing.

Couple questions though

Why did Friday Night Lights kill Danny?

And what was the reason he always stuck up for him in the first place?"
Chelsea Does,"i stopped watching in the first episode when Ben Mendelsohn's character stops at a roadside restaurant , takes a bite of a fish sandwich and then spits it out, says he won't pay for it, and the hot woman running the food stand smiles at him like she's into him........i just thought ""this is shit"" and stopped"
Chelsea Does,"Well, now I don't need to rewatch.  Lol.

I did LOVE Mendelsohn!   And I loved the show, especially first season."
Chelsea Does,Should have been a one and done mini series. First season is great but it fell hard after that.
Chelsea Does,"As someone who adored Damages, I just didn’t care for the series. And unlike everyone else I had absolutely no sympathy for Ben’s character, and the reveal that his recklessness as a kid led to the death of the sister just made me less sympathetic."
Chelsea Does,Its pretty okayish. I found it to be the ultimate slow burn series. season 3 kinda gets dicey tho
Chelsea Does,I got three episodes in and was bored out of mind
Chelsea Does,"The first season is so long winded and boring. It could have been half as long and nothing would have been lost. 

I started the second season and realized I didn't care."
Chelsea Does,it fell off cause they forced it to end
Chelsea Does,"I didn't mind it as much when I first watched it. Maybe the second time around I will start to notice some problems that viewers say there are, I mean if the majority of people think season three is terrible. I would still give it a watch if I were you though, just to see how you'll feel. The finale was sort of abrupt in the end."
Chelsea Does,Nah. It’s fine to watch
Chelsea Does,That's what everybody else is saying.😂
Chelsea Does,"I think it's bc as others have mentioned, it was forced. I've only recently watched and was looking on some good content on Sally and her breakdown at the end. I know they built it up a little with her leaving at one point, allowing her husband to abuse the kids, in whatever manner. But I still feel like it was out of character how she was awful at the end."
Chelsea Does,"It does sort of end abruptly. However, I would watch it anyway, just out of curiosity. In a way, I kind of like it, it sort of leaves the audience to decide what happens next, coming up with theories."
Chelsea Does,"Yeah, I read somewhere that it was financial and production problems or something they just couldn't make it work anymore so they had to wrap it up. It was originally planned to be a six season series."
Chelsea Does,"Yes, of course, you're right. I did read about the awards and how Ben Mendelsohn won one."
Chelsea Does,"Yeah, my memory of this show is being so dissapointed that they introduced an estranged son or something in the last 30 seconds of season 1 to have a big cliffhanger and it felt super forced. It was the same feeling I had at the end of season one of ""You"" where I felt fine with dipping out of the show and just pretending the last-minute addition of a new storyline didn't happen."
Chelsea Does,"I forgotten how she finds out but actually I don't know if she ever does, it's been awhile so I can't remember exactly, I think they come clean or she finds out for herself, I'm leaning towards the latter. They all end up in bad places, nobody wins in the end. Kevin is about to get arrested, Meg ran away, John's wife leaves him and presumably takes the kids with her. He is also, in the very last scene of the show, about to tell Nolan that he killed Danny, his father."
Chelsea Does,John (Kyle Chandler) kills Danny because Danny has put the family in a very difficult and dangerous situation as part of his vengeance for feeling betrayed by them for what happened when they were children. It came to that point where John goes over the edge and he attacks Danny and they fight in the water and John drowns him out of anger and rage. It is also out of never-ending guilt of not standing by Danny despite the close relationship they had and that's why from then on he has always tried to make it up to Danny and the pressure was killing him.
Chelsea Does,You can't let that one moment stop you.
Chelsea Does,"What happened when they were children?

I'm legit trying to YouTube the answer but nothing says that."
Chelsea Does,I knew I should've been more specific. I really do recommend that you continue watching I think you'll get more of a kick just watching it.
A Man Called God,Up until they said Korea I had no idea which systemic religious sex crimes they were going to expose. Keep 'em comin'!
A Man Called God,"10 years for three rapes, release, and subsequent rape..."
A Man Called God,Thought this was going to be about the moonies.
A Man Called God,"I’m not sensitive at all, I eat up horror and documentaries about uncomfortable topics, but this one is very brutally straight forward.

Like, there’s no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
A Man Called God,"Aside from the documentary, I’d love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That’s a documentary all to itself."
A Man Called God,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
A Man Called God,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
A Man Called God,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
A Man Called God,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family’s involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea’s search engine. Creepy stuff."
A Man Called God,"OMG!!! I’m actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
A Man Called God,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It’s the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more “man of God” using the scriptures to literally screw children."
A Man Called God,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
A Man Called God,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they’re trying to hide.
A Man Called God,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
A Man Called God,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
A Man Called God,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
A Man Called God,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
A Man Called God,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
A Man Called God,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
A Man Called God,Reverend Moon?
A Man Called God,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
A Man Called God,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
A Man Called God,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
A Man Called God,Cool now do the Catholics of America
A Man Called God,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
A Man Called God,Do jehovah's witnesses next
A Man Called God,Religious people be like: “come to our church so we can molest u”
A Man Called God,IMHO I can’t wait for all organized religion to die…. The harm it’s caused far outweighs any good.
A Man Called God,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
A Man Called God,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
A Man Called God,Will this involves the moonies?
A Man Called God,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
A Man Called God,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
A Man Called God,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
A Man Called God,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
A Man Called God,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
A Man Called God,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
A Man Called God,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
A Man Called God,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
A Man Called God,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don’t care about some “leaders” in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
A Man Called God,Netflix sucks haha
A Man Called God,[removed]
A Man Called God,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
A Man Called God,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
A Man Called God,The world is really fucked up.
A Man Called God,">3rd March

btw"
A Man Called God,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we’re sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to “evangelize” people. It’s flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a “devil” to bring down the “will of God”. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
A Man Called God,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
A Man Called God,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
A Man Called God,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
A Man Called God,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
A Man Called God,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn’t want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn’t true - it’s disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn’t see anyone else mention it."
A Man Called God,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It’s a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
A Man Called God,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
A Man Called God,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
A Man Called God,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
A Man Called God,"I say, do the USA next!"
A Man Called God,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
A Man Called God,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
A Man Called God,Reminds me of “silenced” about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
A Man Called God,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
A Man Called God,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
A Man Called God,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
A Man Called God,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
A Man Called God,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
A Man Called God,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
A Man Called God,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
A Man Called God,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary 😌
A Man Called God,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
A Man Called God,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
A Man Called God,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
A Man Called God,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
A Man Called God,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a “virtue”
A Man Called God,"Reminds me of Tool’s song, ‘Opiate’"
A Man Called God,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
A Man Called God,Name?
A Man Called God,Is this related to the unity Church?
A Man Called God,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."
A Man Called God,just put the CC on then
A Man Called God,"You can change this in the audio settings, FYI."
A Man Called God,"I can’t do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
A Man Called God,That’s what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
A Man Called God,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
A Man Called God,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
A Man Called God,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
A Man Called God,I feel so sick watching the former victim reliving the scene where she waved mops to jms. This documentary weirdly focuses on male gaze
A Man Called God,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
A Man Called God,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
A Man Called God,Then do a series. All American religions.
A Man Called God,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
A Man Called God,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
A Man Called God,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?
A Man Called God,🙃
A Man Called God,Well it’s made by Netflix so I’m gonna assume no
A Man Called God,You showed them.
A Man Called God,"*Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey* and *the Keepers* are both pretty interesting"
A Man Called God,"Give Jesus Camp a watch if you haven’t already, gave me some un-invited flashbacks."
A Man Called God,"Dude, delete this. There are tons of documentaries on US evangelicals and the shit they get into.  This just shows you're too lazy to look before posting."
A Man Called God,The only problem with that is that its too many documentaries too little time to make them. They already have a small mountain. The supply overtakes production regardless of demand.
A Man Called God,There's actually a ton of them.
Ajin,"dude, this is freaking awesome.

The two last episodes of the first season are some of the best TV I have ever seen. Satou is freaking badass. When he is fighting the SWAT team..... or when he drops that building....

""how unfortunate. You were so close."" "
Ajin,"Secret

Ajin 

Man"
Ajin,"I've only seen the first season so far, I never had time to start the second, but it has been a major hit for my new anime shows to watch. I watched the first season weekly after other shows had ended.

Ajin has an amazing story, cg animation that doesn't suck, and great chracters. Satou is one of the coolest and comic booky villains I've seen in an Seinen type anime.

Other shows that caught my attention recently are Drifters(incredible animation) and All Out!!(Rugby Anime with characters who actually look like they're built for sports.)

Arslan Senki which I think Netflix also picked up and dubbed the first season, is another amazing story. Think Suikoden.

Aldnoah Zero I watched weekly. First season was built up nicely. Second season not so much. Also picked up by Netflix. Shows like this, Arslan Senki, Drifters and Aijin make watching Anime easier for me. Usually I just hate the Shonen style shows where it's all about hard work and raw power. Intelligence and teamwork tend to help too.

Oh, and Overlord! I wish that gets a second season. "
Ajin,"This is great news, first season was really good.

Here goes away the productivity."
Ajin,Now waiting on Attack on Titan
Ajin,Never heard of this before! Worth the watch? Quick Synopsis?
Ajin,I knew I should have called in sick today.
Ajin,"Premise sounds interesting, but god do I hate that crappy animation."
Ajin,Yeeesssss I know what I'm binging tonight!
Ajin,cool thanks for the heads up been waiting for this :)
Ajin,Nice. I know what I'am doing first thing today
Ajin,[deleted]
Ajin,Cool!
Ajin,"ok i have a question about season 1. *slight spoilers* around episode seven, when the main character gets rescued by satou, does hos personality make a 180? i swear before that, he was a typical anime main character thats hella nice and all, but after the rescue, he becomes a guy whose every move is calculated and mainly thinks about himself. this happened right?"
Ajin,"Netflix needs to at least try advertising their shows a bit. They miss a lot of potential viewers. I've never heard of this for instance. They did the same with Marco Polo, most people didn't know what it was about let alone it's brilliant epicness. Some promotion would be a good thing for us too!"
Ajin,"One of the best anime I have seen recently. Never fails to get me invested with great action and an interesting premise that, in my opinion, delivers throughout. 

Not to mention that it's CG animation is fantastic for a regular show (as opposed to a film), a milestone in the medium. I'd expect nothing less from Polygon."
Ajin,"I tried watching this show. And I still don't understand it
"
Ajin,"I watched the first episode and was kinda put off by the animation style, I guess I will give it another try"
Ajin,After the building dropped I thought it just went idiotic. They really couldn't think any better tactic to deal with him than that? Same with Satou after the building drop. His tactic was... not a tactic at all. It was like the writer just gave up. 
Ajin,"Some Immortal ""humans"" (ajins) get hunted by the government to be keept as laboratory rat. They obviously don't want to be held in prision and be killed over and over again in experiements, so they run away / fight back. It's quite decent imo."
Ajin,"Haven't yet seen the second season, but if it is anything like the first, I would say so. 

[First Episode spoilers](#s ""A few years prior to the start of the show, a person is discovered who comes back to life a few seconds after they die, restored to perfect health. That person was completely normal before their first death. Now, the world is constantly looking for other people who are the same as this person, which they've named Ajin. A few dozen are found over the years, in various countries around the world. Noone knows why some people do it or why. Governments want to research it, and all the nations are competing in a sort of arms race to get their hands on them. Main character is a school kid in Japan who gets hit by a car on his way home from school. Dies, then revives in full view of everyone. Has heard horror stories about what the government does to those captured, so he goes on the run, everyone starts chasing him."")

That's a *very* barebones explanation. There's a lot more going on beyond that, but that starts getting into more serious spoilers. 

On a non-plot level, the show uses a slightly peculiar animation style that some people hate, but which I think suits the show well once you get used to it. Show can be very gory at times, so probably not something to watch with little kids around. English dubs are solidly done. Some truly amazing scenes in the first season, and a pretty interesting plot. 

Definitely worth a watch. "
Ajin,You get used to it. I wasn't a fan either at first but the story is good enough make the wonky art more or less a non issue.
Ajin,"Ditto. Was excited for the new Saint Seiya and Berserk shows but then I saw the trailers. Needless to say, couldn't make it past a couple of episodes. "
Ajin,How come there is no nudity in Marco Polo season 2? I'm on ep 5 or 6 and haven't continued because of it!
Ajin,"That sounds really good. I've loved most Netflix shows, but I haven't dabbled into any of their anime. Thanks!"
Ajin,"That sounds interesting.

Is it an anime, due to name Ajin being like an Asian name, or is it a live action show?"
Ajin,"A couple months ago I almost watched the show, but after 10 seconds I turned it off because of the animation. I'm gonna give it a second look today though :P"
Ajin,The beserk animation is so fucking bad. Such a damn shame.
Ajin,It's not like a Netflix original. Its a jap cartoon based off a jap comic. It's not bad but the cgi looks super unnatural. 
Ajin,"It's anime. Very strange art style. The art style was the only thing i didn't like about. Good characters, decent plot. I'd give it a 7/10."
Ajin,"Serious question - is it cool to use the word ""jap""?"
Ajin,It's branded as one.
Ajin,Yeah the cgi/animation was just too weird for me. Didn't even finish the first episode
Ajin,"I appreciate you responding, thanks, koobstylz.

Yeah, I found the animation a bit odd, myself. General sense of unpleasantness, watching episode 1, the way the Ajin are getting hunted, the colour of the thing, all that.

Not very nice people at times, will see if it's worth a 2nd ep."
Ajin,"It's not, most people think it is because of Jew is okay, but it's different. "
Ajin,"Honestly, it kinda just doesn't come up enough for anyone to be bothered by it anymore.

Like, if someone called me a zipperhead, I wouldn't be appalled by the fact that they called me a racist term, I'd just be wondering where their time machine is and why they decided to travel from the 1970s to here of all places instead of visiting the dinosaurs."
Ajin,*shrug* I don't care.  
Ajin,I've been told no. I heard it was the same as jew. Contextual. Japanese is just so long. 
Ajin,[deleted]
Ajin,Do you mean Jewish American Princess ( Jap ala [Jap battle rap](https://youtu.be/-TQmo5TvZQY))?
Ajin,Lol Japanese people call everyone else foriengners and its derogatory. If I can't call them jap for short I'm not calling them anything because I'm just a gaijin Fuck who will never be a pure blooded citizen of Nippon. 
Ajin,"Yeah, Jew is context based. ""He is a Jew"" versus ""he is Jewish"" are fine, but the former can be off in the wrong context. 

I've never heard jap used that way, though. I always assumed it was just a holdover from the 1940s. "
Ajin,Because I was curious if a previously used derogatory word had become acceptable. OP could have need using it ironically for all I knew. 
Ajin,"He dropped a hard ""j"" on us."
Ajin,I don't know it sounds fine to me. Japanese people don't even identify your nationality. Its just a deragotoru term meaning not Japanese when referring to other races. Id like to know what a Japanese person thinks about the word jap vs gaijin. 
Ajin,"It's a racist term, but Asians are rarely targets of overt racism so no one cares that much. Still, would make me uncomfortable if I heard it irl. "
Ajin,I mean Japanese words for non Japanese is derogatory by default. I'd be irritated if my japanese friend got mad at me for referring to him as a jap when he refers to me and everyone else as wide eye. 
Ajin,"Well in the past it was, but I agree with you in terms of it being used IRL.  I'm not suggesting OP is dropping n-bomb equivalents, but it certainly isn't so,etching I would say. "
Ajin,"But as a non Japanese person, I've been referred to as a jap before. Using the word is a signal to me that whoever is using it doesn't care enough about my feelings as a person to not use loaded terms around me. It's like someone using gay in the ""that's so gay"" to mean something's bad. "
Ajin,The most insulting thing you can call an Asian is a different type of Asian because they hate each other so much. Me saying jap doesn't even touch the significance of hate between China and Japan or Korean and Japan. And that's because their conflict goes back hundreds of years. 
Ajin,"It looks so interesting, but that 2.5 animation is so stiff and off-putting. "
Ajin,"The manga for this is so good, it has one of the most badass villain."
Ajin,so when is this going to be available to watch?
Ajin,Are they going to release original Japanese language version in US
Ajin,"I really like the manga series for this, I had no idea it was coming to netflix though, this is cool."
Ajin,[removed]
Ajin,i really need to get into anime more but whenever i do i'm depressed for like 2 weeks after i've burned through a series. (PADS)
Ajin,"Great anime! It takes awhile to get use to the cgi, but it's worth it."
Ajin,"Looks great, too bad it's dubbed."
Ajin,"This is what put me off RWBY. Any given still frame looks great, but I can't deal with the animation, takes me out of the story."
Ajin,"You get use to it, trust me the story and characters are amazing if you stick with it."
Ajin,The prison break and riding a skyscraper were awesome.
Ajin,It's already out.
Ajin,Yeah it is subbed and dubbed on netflix.
Ajin,"Netflix has subs and dubs in multiple languages. (You might need to change language in account settings to use all of them, but it has Japanese and English audio and subs by default) "
Ajin,"What if I'm someone that likes to do other activities when I watch anime? Like if I'm playing a game, I'll listen to the dubs and when I hear something interesting happening I'll pause and watch the action. I honestly can't understand the irrational hate of dubs.."
Ajin,it has JP audio moron
Ajin,See there is your problem. You have to watch some more upbeat animes for example Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood and Madoka Magic they are pretty lighthearted and family friendly and i suggest them for everyone who wants to watch lighthearted entertainment 
Ajin,"I checked on netflix , they have Japanese audio also available."
Ajin,"agreed, also too bad it's hosted on an inferior American website instead of glorious nippon one."
Ajin,Yeah I really didn't see it coming. I've been keeping up with the anime and holy hell is he a badass. I don't even blame him for what he's doing. Anyone would go crazy going through what he went through.
Ajin,It's the painful voice acting... anyone who doesn't cringe at dubbed isn't human.
Ajin,"／人◕ ‿‿ ◕人＼
"
Ajin,I hear Berserk is quite the fun series.
Ajin,"Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood ... upbeat?

""Ed...ward?""

Fma hits me hard due to my brother and I being really close. Parts are hilarious and awesome. Then there's THOSE moments; the moments that break your heart and fill your manly eyes with stinging tears of sorrow.

And lets not mention the original anime ending. *cry*"
Ajin,"isnt fma:brotherhood the one that has the person say ""its raining"" and then it has the soldier crying"
Ajin,You have been identified by a variety of reliable sources as the clear definition of the player most highly regarded as valuable.
Ajin,Yep its a great upbeat comedy sitcom let is very relate able 
Ajin,"It's a bad day for rain.  
  
It's not raining.  
  
Yes, it is. *tear falls*  
  
Oh, so it is."
Ajin,nah it was tears of joy 
Ajin,"They didn't produce it or anything. They just licensed it. The decision isn't up to them, and Polygon are busy working on [Drifting Dragons](https://youtu.be/OysZKfjPZ14). (The source for Drifting Dragons is one of the best manga coming out in English, so hopefully they do it justice.)"
Ajin,"There were only 2 seasons. 

Plus, Netflix just has the license. They don't have the authority to demand more. Polygon Pictures is the studio that produced it"
Ajin,"Such a good anime.

100% need a new season."
Ajin,"Huh I remember reading this manga a while ago, didn't realize it was popular enough for a show?"
Ajin,"I finished it the other week, and it's maybe the 7th anime I've seen. I started watching them at the beginning of the year, just starting with the high-rated ones on Netflix like Death Note and Steins;Gate (but Your Lie in April is my favourite so far.)

I thought the story was great, but I'm still not keen on the animation style. I kind of got used to it after a few episodes, but I guess I would prefer something more traditional. Also I wish this season was a bit longer, but they left it off at a pretty satisfying ending."
Ajin,"Other good netflix animes (which I'm sure are already being suggested by netflix lol):

Seven Deadly Sins,
Knights of Sidonia,
Attack on Titan
"
Ajin,"I have not, but Netflix has some great anime if you want to get into it. I suggest checking out either Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, or Tengen Toppa Gurran Lagann. Gurran Lagann still has one of my fave final episodes. Now be warned Gurran Lagann can (will) get very over the top a times, but still a great show."
Ajin,Just finished watching Ajin last week. It's really good. The concept of the show and its character's are unique.
Ajin,[deleted]
Ajin,"Comically, the show is really middle of the road.  Not a whole lot of surprises or comedy.  It's far far longer, but check out Hunter x Hunter.  They only have the first 100 of 150 episodes on netflix, but (even having seen around 300 different anime) it's easily one of my top 5."
Ajin,"No, but I will after I'm done with Animals on HBO. "
Ajin,"If you like Aijn give Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood a try. Its a good anime for first time watchers and is paced very well. From there you have numerous good animes on Netflix, Naruto, Bleach, Hunter X are all popular shonens"
Ajin,"I'm watching it and the main reason why I'm enjoying it because I hate the protagonist. 

I also loved the older man (sato) who seem out of his mind, he doesn't give a fuck. "
Ajin,"Tried to watch it on Netflix and I more or less got hooked after the third episode but the voices kinda kept making me cringe so I looked it up and watched it with subs and was a rather more pleasant experience. Looking forward to season 2.

What is it with english voice actors making most young characters sound like kids, its just one of my gripes with some dub work in animated series."
Ajin,Give Seven Deadly Sins a try it is also on Netflix. Features some awesome and powerful characters/fights.
Ajin,"Yes, I've been watching it. I've seen only 2 episodes but it is quite good so far. I read the manga beforehand though, so while I would have appreciated a more traditional art style, the CGI is growing on me. I see it as something that differentiates itself from other anime, really. A recommendation of an anime that handles a similar subject matter would be [Tokyo Ghoul](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3741634/?ref_=nv_sr_1)."
Ajin,"As a relatively newcomer to Anime, I have to suggest Naruto & Fairy Tail!"
Ajin,[deleted]
Ajin,"Honestly, while I liked Seven Deadly Sins, it was incredibly formulaic and felt like a lot of other anime."
Ajin,Check out Psychopass (S1) and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex if you are into Sci-fi.
Cain and Abel,Wait until you watch Leftovers and notice it is about the rapture
Cain and Abel,Where was the hairless polar bear in that?
Cain and Abel,No.
Cain and Abel,Did the bible drop the ball on the ending as well?
Cain and Abel,"I mean this in the least snarky way possible, but... how was that not obvious? I mean, it was incredibly on-the-nose, and I think you’re giving professional writers too much props for basic surface-level biblical themes"
Cain and Abel,It lived in a cul-de-sac in the Garden of Eden.
Cain and Abel,The show is old enough that OP may have been way younger when he watched it and less versed in common tales taken from the Bible or elsewhere. 
Cain and Abel,Because not everyone is a Bible thumping fucko
Cain and Abel,Lol I’m about as far from bible-thumping as you can get. I’ve just taken basic literature classes...
Cain and Abel,"I agree with you, out of all the stories in the bible this is one of the most common and I'm not even religious.

It was quite obvious for anyone with even a bit of knowledge of common themes in society."
Cain and Abel,Didn't expect Superman to be associated with Supernatural
Cain and Abel,"It's a prequel, which is cool because it means they can beat the dead horse while it's still living."
Cain and Abel,[deleted]
Cain and Abel,I Loved supernatural even the unnecessary 10 seasons after 5 just cuz of dean winchester but this show feels even more unnecessary? We had basically their folks entire pre pilot arc told in flashbacks and time travel. I feel like there are many spin-offs that could’ve happened. Seems like a strange choice.
Cain and Abel,"I watched Supernatural up to S8. I was trying to get to S11 where the show is supposed to go back to actually being Season 1 to 5 good, but I kind of gave up after the Leviathan crap.

The trailer to this looks quite worse than that season."
Cain and Abel,They should cast Tom welling in the Witcher series
Cain and Abel,"As much as I am a fan of supernatural, I see this show as kind of unnecessary. They should’ve just left Supernatural alone when it ended. Although I am saying this, I know damn well I’m probably still gonna watch The Winchesters. Won’t bad mouth it too much till I see it. I just don’t know how they’ll handle the inevitable plot holes and the complete retelling of John and Mary’s stories"
Cain and Abel,"Wow, 2007 is going to be really excited about this."
Cain and Abel,this is a dumb idea for a show.
Cain and Abel,"I don’t care what people say, I will watch the shit out of this show. I stopped watching television almost a decade ago, and growing up smallville was one of the only shows I actually watched. I can’t wait to watch welling again"
Cain and Abel,That's so funny. I know early on in Supernatural. They wanted to do an episode where they had to save Tom Welling from the Superman curse.
Cain and Abel,That’s cool.
Cain and Abel,"Without David Ogden Stiers, I’m not interested."
Cain and Abel,Yeah I’m probably gonna watch at least a few episodes in the hope that I can actually understand how it’s a prequel with both John and Mary hunting. But more Tom Welling is always appreciated
Cain and Abel,When Supernatural first started I thought Sam was played by Welling.
Cain and Abel,So talk ville is done?
Cain and Abel,"Dammit, now I'm interested..."
Cain and Abel,WAIT IS THIS SUPERNATURAL
Cain and Abel,This is an origin story about Charles Winchester lll from MASH
Cain and Abel,I opened this thread hoping this show would be about the Winchester rifle family/Winchester mystery house. I'm disappointed. That would be a good spooky show.
Cain and Abel,I just really miss all the classic rock from the early seasons
Cain and Abel,Is he playing a series regular? I guess this doesn't bode well for this show *Professionals* that is supposed to debut on the CW soon.
Cain and Abel,Just remember this show can get 20 season and catch up with supernatural
Cain and Abel,Supermantural
Cain and Abel,"I am finding the Vancouver connections threading through both the Winchesters and Walker interesting: 
Jensen Ackles worked with Tom Welling on Smallville (also a WB/CW show, filmed in metro Vancouver ) before Supernatural. Being in Van, he, Jared Padalecki and Tom Welling hung out while both shows were in production. Meanwhile Mitch Pileggi (X-Files’ Skinner), worked with Kim Manners who went on to direct Supernatural. Pileggi then landed a small but key recurring guest spot on Supernatural, working with Jared Padalecki. Pileggi is now a regular on Walker."
Cain and Abel,Why not? Dean Winchester was in Smallville after all.
Cain and Abel,He was in Lucifer too as Cain
Cain and Abel,Fun fact Jensen Ackles quit Smallvile to join Supernatural...That is how long is was on.
Cain and Abel,lol. Recently learnt that some some people consider season 5 the true ending of the original show so I'll save it for slow fall break and binge it till then.
Cain and Abel,They squeezed 15 seasons out 5. Anything's possible.
Cain and Abel,"Knowing Supernatural it's a time line deviation. We know that the angels have no qualms going back to ""fix"" the timeline especially concerning the Winchesters."
Cain and Abel,They messed a lot with the lore as the show was ongoing so it's not surprising they're changing more things up.
Cain and Abel,We’ll have to watch and see how Jensen and Daneel handled that. I am curious too. Hopefully it also explains how/where Sam is.
Cain and Abel,"It looks like they’re retconning that story. In this one John hunts with Mary, but in the show it was her death that pushed him to start."
Cain and Abel,Well from what I've read there were several spinoffs in the works but noon of them was really given a chance. Hopefully this one will be decent enough (tho i have hard time believing it :( )
Cain and Abel,[deleted]
Cain and Abel,Yeah that season with the Leviathan crap is the one where I was out too.
Cain and Abel,I am curious what (if anything) we get about John’s MoL family heritage.
Cain and Abel,"I agree, watch it run for 7 seasons"
Cain and Abel,Whats dumb is not going forward with their last backdoor pilot.  That lady hunter show would have been pretty cool.
Cain and Abel,They 10000% should have done this. That would have been AMAZING
Cain and Abel,"He's recurring, and The Professionals is a show that aired in 2020 that the CW recently acquired. Not sure if they have plans to continue."
Cain and Abel,Somebody Saaaave meeee
Cain and Abel,They filmed the shows right near each other. Welling has told a story where after leaving the Smallville set he stopped by where supernatural was filming to pull a prank on them.
Cain and Abel,"Maybe a bit off topic, but I always figured they should make a movie where the story is set in Vancouver, but filmed in countless American cities and towns"
Cain and Abel,As in Cain and Abel?
Cain and Abel,"And Cain from Supernatural was ""God"" in Lucifer"
Cain and Abel,"The creator originally had three arcs planned for the show. He didn’t know how many seasons it would take to tell all three arcs, but that was the original plan. Then in Season 3, during the second arc, the writer’s strike happened which changed the creator’s plans to an extent (he believes for the better, and I tend to agree). So then they got to Season 5 and felt that that was the best place to finish off the third arc and the show. But before they could finish the show, the network renewed it for a Season 6. So the creator still wrote the Season 5 finale like the series finale he intended, but he brought a couple characters back to life that would have stayed dead and added on a scene to the very end of the episode to allow the show to go forward into a potential Season 6.

So you can easily ignore that last scene or cut the episode off before it plays and treat Season 5 as the end of the show with no issues.

The creator then stepped down and gave the showrunner job to one of the head writers while he stayed on as a writer/consultant for Season 6. Season 6 didn’t outright contradict any of the lore from the first five seasons (except for maybe two or three things), but it did introduce a number of new concepts that didn’t exactly gel very well with the mythology of those first five seasons. Afterwards the original creator left the show and the Season 6 showrunner did another season which had a lot of character issues, but fewer lore problems than Season 6. Then she left the show and a previous writer for the show came on to be the new showrunner.

This third showrunner said he had a three season plan for the show, but that plan got stretched to four seasons in the end (though what this plan was isn’t nearly as clear as what the original creator’s three arc plan was). Season 8 contains one particularly notorious lore addition that retroactively opens up a huge plot hole in Season 6, but otherwise it’s not too bad from a lore perspective (though it had some character issues of its own in the first half and last few episodes). Season 9 also introduced two huge retcons which created plot holes in earlier seasons and retreaded a lot of the Season 6 plot lines in likely unintentional ways. Season 10 didn’t have much in the way of character or lore issues. And while most people found Season 11 to be the most engaging season since Season 5, it introduced so many retcons, issues, and plot holes with the lore (though it did do quite well with the characters). You could also pretty much treat Season 11 as a potential series finale. There is a scene which completely wraps everything up. And then there’s two more scenes after that which set up Season 12. The showrunner knew he was leaving the show though and set up those last two scenes for the person who was coming on to take over the show after him (at their request, is my understanding).

So then another writer who has been with the show a while took over and was the showrunner for Seasons 12-15. Season 12 introduced some really annoying characters, but it did such good work with the lore, wrapping up a ton of lingering plot lines, closing up one of the Season 9 plot holes, using the lore of the first six seasons to drive its plot instead of coming up with a bunch of new stuff that doesn’t mesh with the old like previous seasons did… But then Seasons 13, 14, and 15 went their own way with two or three particular plot lines, ignoring any previous canon or continuity that got in the writers’ way (or that they just couldn’t be bothered to remember). Still plenty of great character moments, but the lore was all but thrown out in the last two and a half seasons.

Bottom line: don’t treat Supernatural as a 15 season show. Treat it as a 5 season show with a 6 season sequel show which has its own 4 season sequel show. If you’re really into the story and ongoing mythology, take a break after Season 5 and decide if you’re happy with that ending. If you are, you can stop there. But if you don’t care about the lore being overturned and forgotten about and just want to spend more time with the main characters, press onwards."
Cain and Abel,"i wouldn't call it a ""true"" ending, but i think it sewed up pretty much all of the open threads from the previous seasons

from that point on it felt like less about the lore it had been building up, but they managed to really lean into the characters that got people loving the show over time"
Cain and Abel,There was a *Scooby-Doo* crossover later on — [*Scoobynatural*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JkwZok_GHw) — which I would highly recommend.
Cain and Abel,"6 sucks. 7 isn’t great if you don’t like the main bad guys. 8 gets good again, 9 and 10 are true to form, 11-15 I can barely remember. The last few episodes were good."
Cain and Abel,"i saved only those and watched twice. just forget last 10 secs and move on.

if you miss them, you can always ask google for best solo ride episodes and try them."
Cain and Abel,"Honestly, it stayed pretty good.  I can't remember which season it kinda fell off the rails but it eventually did."
Cain and Abel,That’s when I stopped watching. The leviathan storyline was not doing it for me the following season and I just never went back.
Cain and Abel,"Of course that would be retcon in itself since apart from one, debatably two, episodes Supernatural always used the type of time travel where you can only fulfill the past, not change it, through time traveling.

If they want to keep it completely within canon the easiest way would be to have it be one of the alternate universes that exists within that series’s multiverse."
Cain and Abel,"$10 the series ends with them having to forget their past lives and some monologue about how ""our love beats time, we'll find each other again one day and save the world"" or some shit"
Cain and Abel,I still mourn Wayward Sisters. That would have been such a fun show
Cain and Abel,"I wish we had gotten Wayward Sisters, Jodi and Donna were some of the best reoccurring characters"
Cain and Abel,There were a few but they all sounded awful except the one about the colt.
Cain and Abel,"The issue with shows like these is that they have incredibly long seasons (20+ episodes in each one), they are not well paced for today's standards and they have LOTS of filler. 

I remember that I was amazed at how S6 managed to have NOTHING happen for a whole season. Then the Leviathans showed up and I was like ""yeah, I need to use my time better"". I actually stopped after S8, when Dean had a vampire best friend or whatever and they were searching for God's words. 

The idea that I must endure another two mediocre seasons before the showrunners go back to give half a shit, only for the show to end poorly (according to what I've heard at least) is pretty much unjustifiable when the golden age of TV is drowning you with well paced great shows. You could even go back and discover older great shows (for example, I'm watching a couple of Star Trek TNG episodes every week or so).

About a month ago, I was in the mood for a ""bad but fun show"" again and I decided to watch the first season of Lucifer which was incredibly dumb, but also entertaining and half as long as a season of SN. Turns out I burned through it. 

Can't do that with shows like Supernatural."
Cain and Abel,"I found all the fun goofy episodes were the best episodes, the one where they came to our reality, the episode from the car's perspective, Scooby Doo, etc.

The early seasons had an X-files vibe or something that hooked me in though."
Cain and Abel,"Probably would if this was the CW of yesteryear. But with Nexstar in charge now, wouldn't be surprised if this is short-lived."
Cain and Abel,I liked the multiverse aspect too tbh.That world they set up was interesting. Could have been a bit interesting change up to the mythos
Cain and Abel,This hit me in all the feels bones
Cain and Abel,"From Allison Mack?

Superman's two friends became scumbags. That's weird."
Cain and Abel,There's an Episode called The French Mistake that covers this. :)
Cain and Abel,Maybe when the do the SPN reunion show they can legit have some of it set in Van. I’ll be disappointed (for the crew) if they do not film the reunion show there.
Cain and Abel,Indeed
Cain and Abel,Why the quotes? Are you referring to God Johnson?
Cain and Abel,"Love this comment. It's obvious you're very passionate about supernatural. I left it back in s11 after also quitting back in s6, never bothered to keep watching.
If it's not too much hassle, what were the plot holes that were created after each season?"
Cain and Abel,I wonder how much COVID impacted season 15. It’s probably the season that felt the most hackish in the sense that there were a lot of plot points that appeared to be set ups for future storylines that ended up being forgotten.
Cain and Abel,"Lol yea this is a similar summary to what my friends have told me. Basically, Supernatural would’ve been better off just taking a break a few years and getting multiple sequel series. 

It’s the parts between when the new writers had to wrap up past shit while not knowing exactly how they wanted to do future shit that don’t work well and cause all the problems. In that way, it’s funny because Supernatural isn’t a show that really went too long like you’d expect, but more of a show that didn’t take enough breaks."
Cain and Abel,"Thank you for the summary! I stopped watching after the first story wrapped up, then watched another season but to me it felt like the series had an ending already and the new season wasn't doing it for me. I heard that after season 10 the show go a nice stride but i was happy with the first seasons so i decided to accept it as the true ending and leave it there."
Cain and Abel,All I could think of while I was watching this is when Sam and Dean get to be apart of scooby doo.
Cain and Abel,"If I’m not mistaken,  I believe it was always planned to end after season 5, but the network wanted to continue, so they added that last bit to set up S6."
Cain and Abel,[deleted]
Cain and Abel,I stopped after 8
Cain and Abel,"Thing is depending on who you ask you will get very different opinions. Season 13 is really well liked in some corners (especially the first half), some really hate 8 and 9, etc."
Cain and Abel,"Or they can just wipe John's memory again at the end, like they did in the original show. Twice."
Cain and Abel,"They gave them a rushed conclusion in the final season since they knew they weren’t going through with their spinoff. It wasn’t much but at least they gave them sometime.

That other spinoff had an episode dedicated to introducing new characters/storyline (called bloodlines or something) but it was easily one of the poorest episodes in the entire series and didn’t get picked up."
Cain and Abel,I agree
Cain and Abel,I was so disappointed we didn't get to see more of them in a spin off.
Cain and Abel,Kathryn Newton.. She is so talented. That first arc she had on SPN was just so good. The series was always strongest in tackling fundamental family issues.
Cain and Abel,Took me back to when I would watch smallville when I was in high school
Cain and Abel,Funny
Cain and Abel,Unexpected T’ealc appearance
Cain and Abel,Who else? https://supernatural.fandom.com/wiki/Cain
Cain and Abel,"Season 12

* >!We were told in Season 5 that whoever is hosting Lucifer has to drink a ton of demon blood to keep him in. But Castiel, the President of the U.S., Nick, and *maybe* Vince Vincente were able to hold him. Granted, Castiel accepted Lucifer in Season 11, so that should be listed with that season, but as an angel with a reconstituted body created specifically for him by God, it's possible that that body would be strong enough to hold Lucifer without needing demon blood. Since Crowley rebuilt Nick atom by atom and infused magic from the Cage within each of those atoms, it's possible he also somehow strengthened Nick so be able to hold Lucifer without needing to drink demon blood. And Vince did eventually die from holding Lucifer for too long. But the President never showed any issues having Lucifer inside him.

* >!In a similar vein, it's an odd writing choice that Crowley was able to recreate Nick's body and inscribe God-level magic into Nick's atoms in order to turn him into a walking Cage. Not necessarily a plot hole, but still incredibly far-fetched.

* >!Not really a plot hole, but a strange writing choice: we're told that when the brothers were kept in solitary confinement for a few months they found it worse than anything they'd ever experienced. Both of them have been locked in hell for decades, but apparently solitary confinement for a few months is worse.

Season 13

* >!Season 11 told us that the Empty was nothingness. Season 13 tells us that it's where angels and demons who are killed go.

* >!We're told that Dean and Sam were never born in the alternate universe, but alt-Michael still believes that Dean is his true vessel and is able to use Dean despite them establishing that alt-Michael was specifically created for this alternate universe.

* >!In Season 9 we were told that if anyone goes through the one remaining portal to heaven, it will kill them and destroy their body, thus freeing their soul to let it into heaven. In Season 13 we see Lucifer enter heaven and leave heaven multiple times without anything happening to Nick, the human whose body he's inhabiting.

* >!Season 13 reveals that Lucifer went bad in every alternate universe, but Season 11 reveals that Lucifer went bad because he was given the Mark of Cain. The Darkness was only sealed in the original universe, not in the alternate universes, so this is a plot hole unless the alternate Lucifers were corrupted in some other way or were just made evil to begin with. So this one didn't have to be a plot hole, but they never explained how it wasn't.

* >!Season 13 revealed that Gabriel was secretly alive despite God saying in Season 11 that he was dead. So this is a plot hole unless magic exists that is able to cloud God's knowledge.

* >!Alt-Michael believes that the main universe of the series is just one of God's drafts despite all the evidence that it was the first universe God created. Alt-Michael could just be mistaken, but his whole motivation for coming to the main universe was because he wanted to destroy all of God's drafts, and if the main universe is the original universe rather than one of God's later drafts, that falls outside of alt-Michael's ultimate goal.

* >!Season 5 said that when Lucifer in his true vessel battled with Michael in his true vessel, it would destroy half the world. Lucifer and Michael battled in the Season 13 finale, but there was no damage done to the world. However, this may not be a plot hole given that Lucifer wasn't in his true vessel, Michael was debatably not in his true vessel, Lucifer had lost a ton of his own grace before stealing most of Jack's, and Nick had who knows how many nerfing enchantments carved into each of his atoms, and they established that magic from another universe isn't as potent in a foreign universe which means alt-Michael should have been weaker than regular Michael in the main universe. But that's me making the arguments that the writers should have made.

Season 14

* >!Dean somehow managed to lock Alt-Michael behind a metaphysical door in his mind using only his mental will. Something Sam was basically unable to do with Lucifer or Gadreel in earlier seasons. Maybe Dean has a stronger mental will than Sam, but without an explanation for how this was able to happen, it's a bit of a plot hole.

* >!In Season 13 we were told that not even God could affect the Empty. We see Jack affecting the Empty in Season 13, which might be a plot hole itself or might just be because he is an arch-nephilim. In Season 14 we see the human Nick manage to awaken Lucifer in the Empty through his prayers to Lucifer, which doesn't make any sense unless the magic in his body connect him to Lucifer even when he's in the Empty. However, Season 15 does fix this plot hole a bit by revealing that God not holding sway in the Empty was a lie that the Shadow believed rather than being true though it doesn't really explain how a human managed to reach it unless we go with the magic body explanation.

* >!In the finale Sam realizes that Chuck has been manipulating them to kill Jack. This realization leads him to conclude that God has been manipulating them their entire lives. Chuck doesn't confirm or deny, but Sam doesn't give any explanation as to what brought him to this conclusion.

* >!We're told that Death has a library that contains books full of every possible death that might befall any person based on their choices. Dean has many shelves full of books of possible deaths. But once Alt-Michael comes to the main universe, they all change to alt-Michael destroying the world and Dean with it except for one which says Dean buries himself and alt-Michael in the ocean in a Malak Box. Dean eventually chooses not to go in the Malak Box, and alt-Michael somehow doesn't destroy the world. The books changing can be explained away by Death not taking alternate universe info into account, but all of the books being wrong doesn't really have an explanation.

Season 15

* >!We're told that Ruby met the angel Jo at some point in the past even though we're told that Jo came to Earth in the Season 8 finale and Ruby died in the Season 4 finale.

* >!We were previously told that the Empty was nothingness, and that simply not existing was a torture. But in Season 15 we were instead told that the Empty was a place where angels and demons sleep forever and are forced to relive their worst moments on repeat.

* >!Chuck... Just see this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/xvf9wq/supernatural_so_where_is_jesus/ir22col/

* >!We were told in Season 13 (or 14?) that the Empty would take Castiel for itself when Cas is at his absolute happiest moment. In Season 15 the Empty just grabbed him when he experienced a moment of ""true happiness"".

* >!We're told that Death can see future with its library, seeing the course of everyone's life. But Death was still able to be taken by surprise and killed. (I can understand why the third Death was caught by surprise because she was Death for such a short time before being killed and therefore couldn't have read any of the books in Death's library, but that both the original Death and Billie didn't know how they were going to be killed is baffling.)

* >!We're told that the Shadow was angry at Jack because he exploded in front of it, harming it, and ""making it loud"". And then Jack eventually took Castiel out of the Empty. But no one ever seems concerned about the Shadow attacking to try to get vengeance on Jack even though we know it can get into heaven whenever it wants.

* >!We're told that Billie plans to become the new God after Chuck and Amara die even though her entire arc up to this point has been to restore order, make sure everything plays the role that it was created for, and making sure dead things stay dead. Billie manipulating things to end all life in the universe would have made sense to me, but trying to become the new God felt out of character to me.

* >!After Chuck removed Dean and Sam's plot armor, they were given the luck of the heroes by the goddess Fortuna. And yet even with that luck, Dean dies from falling into a random spike while fighting a random vampire (not even the leader of the nest). I understand a random death like this for a random hunter, but if you have the luck of the heroes of myth on your side, how do you die to anything less than a major monster? Furthermore, since there were vampire bodies all around, you can become a vampire by drinking vampire blood, you can only die as a vampire if you're beheaded, and the brothers know a cure for vampirism, Dean had no reason to die. Sam could have turned him into a vampire, saved him, and then cured him if he wanted.

As I was typing all of this I remembered another issue from Seasons 6 and 7.

6: >!We were told that if the wall in Sam's head was to ever be broken down, he would go insane from the memories of hell and his soul being flayed to the nerve. Just mentally scratching at the wall caused Sam to feel tremendous pain. But when Castiel removed the wall altogether, Sam experienced less pain than when he scratched at it and mostly just had a temporary hallucinogenic trip.!<

7: >!The aftermath of Sam's wall falling had Sam start seeing hallucinations of Lucifer in his waking life. Sam somehow managed to quell these hallucinations, the result of over 120 years of torture of his soul in hell from Lucifer and Michael, by simply pressing a scar on his hand. A little bit of physical pain allowed him to block out all of that soul pain.!<

There may be others, but these are all I can remember relatively off-hand."
Cain and Abel,"Season 6

* >!In the first five seasons, killing monsters and demons was treated as the end of the line for these creatures. There was no thought that these things could come back to life or continue to exist after being killed, but then this season introduced purgatory as the afterlife for monsters which really seemed to weaken the Winchesters' efforts to hunt monsters if they're still alive in an afterlife realm of their own, if the people that they tried to save that turned into monsters were sent to this realm of hunting and killing instead of being free to make it to heaven in death, etc. And since we didn't know if demons counted as the type of monsters that went here, it was feasible that John's quest to find something that could actually kill the demon that killed his wife instead of sending it back to hell had all been for nothing if purgatory was a nicer afterlife to reside in than hell. (Fortunately, Season 13 would eventually reveal that dead demons get sent to The Empty, and there's almost no coming back from that while it's a bit easier to escape purgatory.) Furthermore, while this element wasn't a plot hole in itself, it did feature a demon torturing monsters to try to find purgatory, which is completely nonsensical and would be like a person torturing you to find out how to find and break into heaven.

* >!In the vein of things that weren't really plot holes but didn't really gel with previous lore, Season 6 introduced the concept of the King of Hell, telling us that a relatively low-ranking demon from Season 5 made himself the King of Hell before Season 6, but it never explained how he got that title, what that title means, etc. Season 6 implies that Lucifer was the King of Hell prior to the demon Crowley taking the title, but Lucifer was put right back in the Cage at the end of Season 5. Whatever title he had prior to Season 6 he should have retained unless Season 6 was saying that Lucifer became King of Hell when he broke out of the Cage in the Season 5 premiere and then lost the title when he was reimprisoned. 

* >!Season 6 revealed that burning the bones of a demon will kill that demon. This is apparently because Supernatural's demons are just ghosts that have become particularly malevolent. But in Seasons 1-5 it's established that burning the bones of a ghost just trap it in the afterlife rather than allowing it to continue walking the Earth. So burning a demon's bones should just trap it in hell for eternity, not kill it. (Later seasons would confirm this by showing us the ghost of someone whose bones were burned, still existing despite the loss of their bones.)

* >!Season 4 told us that it took an entire army of angels to break into the regular part of hell and rescue Dean. Season 6 told us that it only took a single angel to get to the deepest and most well-guarded part of hell and snatch Sam's body from the Cage where Lucifer was reimprisoned. That math doesn't really add up unless the forces of hell were really moved around between the two events.

* >!In episode 3 of the season we were told that the weapons of heaven had been stolen and that Castiel had to find them because whoever wielded the weapons of heaven would win the civil war in heaven. When Castiel retrieves the weapons of heaven, he is able to scare off Raphael, the archangel leading the civil war against Castiel. Then the weapons are never referenced again, and Castiel has to find and absorb souls to make sure he stands a chance against Raphael.

* >!In Seasons 4 and 5 there were a number of episodes that involved time travel. All of them used the type of time travel where travel to the past could only fulfill the past, not change it. Season 6 gave us a time travel episode where travel to the past actually could change time. Season 6 tried to explain it away by saying that because Sam and Dean had foiled the plans of heaven, destiny could be changed (despite that not really making sense), but then the very next episode was another time travel episode that went back to the old time travel rules, and from then on every subsequent time travel episode (except one in Season 9, debatably), continued to use the old rules.!<

Season 7

* The only plot hole I remember from this season wasn't really a plot hole as much as it was a poor plot convenience. >!This season introduced the leviathans which could only be permanently killed off via one leviathan eating another, or what was written on the Leviathan Tablet. The brothers had never heard of the Leviathan Tablet. Had no idea where to look for it. The leviathans themselves looked for the tablet, dug it up, and then the brothers found out about it pretty much due to dumb luck. Without the leviathans authoring their own downfall, the brothers would have had no chance to defeat them.!<

Season 8

* >!It was established that Crowley had rogue reapers working for him, and these reapers could get into any of the afterlife realms through back doors that they knew about. They didn't need to go through the ritual revealed in Season 6 to open the door to purgatory, and they were able to use a door in purgatory to get directly into hell. Basically since Crowley spent all of Season 6 trying to find an entrance to purgatory, and Season 8 revealed that he employees creatures that are able to get into purgatory with no effort (and from both hell and Earth, no less), then it makes no sense that he wasn't able to find the entrance to purgatory in Season 6 unless he didn't employ rogue reapers until Season 8, but even then it doesn't explain why he's not siphoning souls from purgatory to make himself more powerful as was his original plan in Season 6. Castiel's fate for imbibing all the souls of purgatory might be preventing Crowley from doing the same, but pulling a handful of souls instead of ALL of the souls would be very much within Crowley's character. But he never does.

* >!We learn that to close the gates of hell permanently, one of the things you have to do is free a soul that was unjustly trapped in hell and deliver them to heaven. This is just a major plot convenience since the soul they found to free had been trapped in hell back in Season 7. Apart from him there doesn't appear to have been any unjustly imprisoned souls in hell that would have allowed the brothers to go through with the task.

* >!The task of closing the gates to hell would remove every demon from Earth permanently. This would be such a huge win for the brothers. But the tasks are killing Sam. Dean begs Sam to not go through with the last trial so that he won't die even though they are friends with an angel that is able to bring people back to life, but they don't once think of asking him to bring Sam back to life after the trials would have killed him.!<

Season 9

* >!It is revealed that reapers are angels. This is problematic for two reasons. Season 4 told us that angels hadn't been on Earth for thousands of years despite reapers being all over Earth constantly, and Season 2 showed us a demon possess a reaper. If demons could possess angels, that would wildly change the plot of Seasons 4 and 5. At some point in a later season they would retcon this retcon to reapers no longer being angels, but for a time this was a huge issue.

* >!In Season 6 Bobby conjures the ghost of Crowley's dead son to learn the whereabouts of Crowley's corpse to hold his bones for ransom to get out of his deal with Crowley. In Season 9 Crowley's son is pulled from the past before he died and told to go live his life in the present. If Crowley's son doesn't die, that means Bobby never got his soul back from Crowley (and therefore wasn't unjustly imprisoned in hell), Crowley's bones were never recovered for Crowley to be able to use to fake his death, etc. It would change a lot of Season 6 and 8. Thankfully Season 12 fixed this by sending Crowley's son back to the past to die as he always would.

* >!In the beginning of the season Charlie dies but is resurrected by Ezekiel. Charlie says she saw her loved ones, implying she was briefly in heaven. But Season 9 later tells us that the gates to heaven were closed in the Season 8 finale (though we are later told that a single entrance to heaven still exists, but it's unclear when this was opened and if it was, whether a reaper could take Charlie's soul all the way there and bring it back in the small amount of time Charlie was dead).!<

Season 10

* Not necessarily a plot hole, but in Season 5 >!Death said that one day he would reap God; Season 10 ends with Death being killed. Of course new Deaths would come into existence later on, but we went through three Deaths in the show being killed before God ever died.!<

Season 11

* >!Season 10 told us that the Darkness existed before God. Season 11 told us that God and the Darkness were two sides of the same coin. One couldn't exist without the other.

* >!The Darkness said she didn't know who Death was despite the fact that Death knew her.

* >!Death said that the Darkness was sealed before the universe was created. The Darkness said she was sealed away after God had created the universe so that she wouldn't destroy it.

* >!Season 11 said Lucifer was God's first creation even though it was a big part of Season 5's mythology that Michael was the first and Lucifer the second.

* >!Season 11 establishes that things God has touched and imbued with power can be found on Earth called Hands of God. The Ark of the covenant is revealed to be a Hand of God. But back in Season 6 we were told that the Ark of the Convenant was a weapon of heaven. It could be both, but they never bring up the possibility of one holding both roles. Similarly, Season 6 said the Staff of Moses was a weapon of heaven while Season 11 said the Rod of Aaron was a Hand of God (the Staff of Moses and Rod of Aaron were either given to the brothers Moses and Aaron at the same time or are the same thing.!<

To be continued."
Cain and Abel,"They had three episodes left to go when COVID hit. The cast have said that the finale we got was conceptually aligned with what had been written pre-COVID, but the huge cast of characters had to be jettisoned* in the post-COVID version.  

I think the original end filled with beloved faces might have blunted the issues some people had with the finale. Personally, I’m mostly in the camp of being relieved that they managed to get back together to make a finale - most of series just did not. AND Mostly mostly I feel sorry AF for the production crew, regular cast and recurring guest cast who were robbed of the epic series wrap party that should have been. 

*Canada (Vancouver) had two week isolation/quarantine requirements for anyone entering the country.  Consequently, it just was not feasible for what would have been upwards of 10-20 actors to enter from the US in order to film a few scenes.

The band Kansas was supposed to be part of the last episode. They were apparently going to flip from filming the last scene to a party."
Degrassi: Next Class,We live in the Post-Family Guy times. No show ever gets canceled. Ever*.
Degrassi: Next Class,This is such a smart thing that netflix has been up to. You already have an established audience for a show that's bummed it's getting canceled - all you do is port them over. Pretty excellent stuff.
Degrassi: Next Class,"Whatever it takes

Degrassi can make it though"
Degrassi: Next Class,Hopefully this means they'll air all the older seasons as well!
Degrassi: Next Class,Netflix is kicking so much ass its amazing.
Degrassi: Next Class,"So does this mean we'll get all seasons of degrassi or just the newer generation. I want the old wheelchair jimmy episodes, or re watching the events that ""lead up to"" what happened to JT. "
Degrassi: Next Class,"Never watched Degrassi, is this good news?"
Degrassi: Next Class,Besides watching it for the hot people Degrassi hasn't been worth watching since Jimmy got shot anyway.

"
Degrassi: Next Class,I have been watching this show for over a decade and I am pretty stoked about this. 
Degrassi: Next Class,"Like Between, it sounds like they've merely picked up the broadcasting rights for a Canadian show. Makes sense."
Degrassi: Next Class,"I'm happy for fans of Degrassi, but part of me doesn't like this. I always find it annoying that every time a show gets cancelled, whether it's been on for 4 seasons or 4 episodes, someone always says ""maybe Netflix will pick it up."""
Degrassi: Next Class,Would be great if Deadwood came back.
Degrassi: Next Class,"If it means I can get back Pushing Up Daisies, then I welcome our netflix based overlord."
Degrassi: Next Class,I'm still waiting patiently for *Terriers* to be resurrected...
Degrassi: Next Class,That means Netflix will pick up Honey Boo Boo...
Degrassi: Next Class,I wonder if this is a good or a bad thing. Some shows should just stay dead (I point to Futurama.)
Degrassi: Next Class,And Netflix is like crack to teenagers. It's a win-win
Degrassi: Next Class,"I hope so, I'd like to watch the earlier episodes at a reasonable quality."
Degrassi: Next Class,Getting shows that were too unpopular for TV?
Degrassi: Next Class,"I think its a show that appeals to a young teenage audience. When I was around that age I watched it, then I grew up and moved on to better TV."
Degrassi: Next Class,As good as a show that's been going on since 1979 can be.
Degrassi: Next Class,Only if approached ironically. Started watching it in my sophomore year of college by way of a drinking game.
Degrassi: Next Class,"imo the show is absolute shit, couldn't stand it. But apparently a ton of people like it, they can't all be wrong. "
Degrassi: Next Class,Well I don't think it hurts Netflix. I like the service and if they are going to pick up shows people wanna see then sweet. I won't be watching Degrassi myself but someone will. I'll admit it gets old sometimes but it seems to be turning into a full business tactic for netflix now.
Degrassi: Next Class,I'm still waiting on another season of Firefly dammit!
Degrassi: Next Class,If Netflix could bring back Torchwood as well..I'd name my firstborn son Netflix
Degrassi: Next Class,"How about ""My So Called Life""? Probably the first time I can remember feeling really bummed out that a show I liked got cancelled after only one season. Imagine if they made a new series where they're all grown up. "
Degrassi: Next Class,Dear fuck no! (although I strongly suspect Honey Boo Boo didn't quite finish her TV career)
Degrassi: Next Class,"Is that a common opinion? I really enjoyed the Comedy Central Futurama episodes, and loved the finale. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they brought it back a third (fourth?) time."
Degrassi: Next Class,"They're not going to be able to do it with every show and they won't. Frankly this was probably an easy call for them since from what I understand it was only the US network that carried them that dropped it. It was still going to be produced in Canada. So if Netflix didn't pick it up someone else probably would have.

It's just grating that people assume every cancelled show they like will wind up on Netflix.
"
Degrassi: Next Class,I still have faith.  Joss is tied up with other projects right now but I still see it happening.
Degrassi: Next Class,"It was more or less a joke, but if Netflix wants to replace cable, they'll need reality TV. Plenty of people like it."
Degrassi: Next Class,"Oh no, people LOVE that show. That opinion is popular because the finale ended the series so perfectly, and nobody wants to see the show get beaten with a shoe like the proverbial dead horse. "
Degrassi: Next Class,No MTV Canada also dropped it as well. It's moving to the Family Channel in Canada. 
Degrassi: Next Class,Well that's obvious. I said I found it annoying that people always suggest it. It's just something that is a possibility these days and not just Netflix. 
Degrassi: Next Class,I did read recently that Netflix are trimming a load of reality TV out of their list because people aren't watching it.
Degrassi: Next Class,"Futurama had 4 finales. 3 out of 4 were a work of art. As much as us fans want to be content with great shows that end greatly, we just ""want to [see] how it ends"" just one more time."
Degrassi: Next Class,"Because most reality watchers watch it when it airs. If there was no cable, they won't just magically stop watching reality TV. "
Degrassi: Next Class,"Absolutely, look at all the clamor about a Firefly reboot, how terrible that would be with the current cast, we just always want more. But people are trying to play it smart this time with the Futurama by pretending they don't want to see it brought back."
Degrassi: Next Class,what were the 4 and which was bad?
Degrassi: Next Class,"The Devil Hands are Idle Playthings (season 4/5 finale)  
Into the Wild Green Yonder (4th movie, honestly not as good as the other 3)  
Overclockwise (The penultimate 6th season finale)   
Meanwhile (7th season finale)   

All written by Ken Keeler."
Degrassi: Next Class,Was the time travel into the future episode ever intended to be a possible finale?
Degrassi: Next Class,"The Late Philip J. Fry? No, just a brilliant one."
Degrassi: Next Class,I originally stopped watching as it was airing around when Nina Dobrev joined the show. Just kind of grew out of it. Going to enjoy watching from the begining though. Might even watch the whole series this time.
Degrassi: Next Class,Growing up in Canada in the 90s I’d watch reruns of the original from the 80s. Wild that the second iteration is old enough now for nostalgia as well. I hate being old.
Degrassi: Next Class,"I can't say I have any interest in watching all of *Degrassi:TNG* again.

That said, there are specific episodes (e.g. ""Whisper to a Scream"") that I can see myself wanting to rewatch.

*Tangent*: Ha! Tubi (and IMDb TV) actually has *Edgemont*!! There are one or two episodes of that show that I would also like to rewatch as well."
Degrassi: Next Class,I know they're going for nostalgia but it's wild they spoiled a character death right in the trailer.
Degrassi: Next Class,"Degrassi is such a long journey to watch. I'm excited for the new ""class "" that was announced recently"
Degrassi: Next Class,"Bring back Drakes character.

I was lucky enough the catch the OG series as it was coming to and end.

Pretty good topics"
Degrassi: Next Class,Wheelchair Jimmy!
Degrassi: Next Class,This was on youtube for free :(
Degrassi: Next Class,"I originally watched the first seasons until Emma and Manny left, maybe a little past Darcy and Spinner. I’ve been rewatching it lately and got past that point.  It’s not terrible and I think what saves it is it stays topical. Some plot lines are recycled, but the way they integrate “new” teen problems like sexting etc is good. IMDB only had up to season 14 though so that’s probably as far as I’ll go. I wanted to wait for HBOMax but they’re taking too long"
Degrassi: Next Class,"To me, Degrassi will always mean Joey Jeremiah, Wheels, and Snake"
Degrassi: Next Class,"Tbf, they just show him post-stabbed. It's not like they immediately cut to his tombstone."
Degrassi: Next Class,"I guess people are more comfortable giving spoilers away for things from years ago, still a dick move for potential new fans. “Don’t get attached to this guy lolol”."
Degrassi: Next Class,"When the pandemic dropped and we were all in lock down, I decided to watch ALL of Degrassi, beginning to end, starting with Junior High.

I grew up when Next Generation was blowing up in the US and know that ""OG"" cast the best. Then they started showing reruns of the original 80's shows and watch them at the time.

I stopped watching shortly after the ""Degrassi Goes Hollywood"" film came out.

Now, having watched all the way through, including the Next Class seasons on Netflix, I was surprised by how much the newer casts grew on me. Though it was always ridiculous the amount of drama and shit these teens went through. But I was able to complete my mission and watched every episode with relative enjoyment as a 30 year old dude.

Not sure if I will rewatch it AGAIN on HboMax, though I tune into the ""Degrassi Channel"" on PlutoTV every now and then."
Degrassi: Next Class,Oh man you made it to Next Class? Kudos to you! Once Holly J left I tuned out lol. She was a great “Paige” with a little more depth.
Degrassi: Next Class,"I made it that far in my journey, there was no going back. Favorite post-Holly character was Drew Torres. Really grew on me. Fucking hated Claire. They made her character insufferable after a while. The show really wanted to make Claire the new Emma.

Before I finished ALL of Degrassi, my fave characters were probably Craig, Spinner, Holly J and Paige, but I would probably replace Craig with Drew."
Degrassi: Next Class,"Oh man Craig was such a mess but I can’t lie when I started rewatching I couldn’t help but tear up on the episodes about his dad. 

Claire was always good with giving advice and being objective to other people in her early seasons. I hated Jenna tbh! But she was good at being the “normal” girl everyone liked I guess. 

I also think they did a good storyline with Sav and standing up to his parents standards. Finally put his foot down!"
Degrassi: Next Class,"Very sad. Young, talented guy who I grew hp watching--we were the same age ended up kind of wasted by the show a lot and eventually written off with no explanation. Glad to see he had still been acting."
Degrassi: Next Class,"His character was straight up blackholed on Degrassi. He was around in an episode that took place during the summer before his character's senior year, and then the character was literally never seen or heard from again."
Degrassi: Next Class,So sad.  He was one of the best actors on the show throughout those seasons.
Degrassi: Next Class,">A cause of death was not revealed.  

Ok."
Degrassi: Next Class,[deleted]
Degrassi: Next Class,RIP
Degrassi: Next Class,"Man, this brings me back to high school. This is sad."
Degrassi: Next Class,What a tough year so far man.
Degrassi: Next Class,"You think that's messed up? His character was the cousin of a token black character (because all black people are related in Canada apparently) named Chantay Black. Yes, they unironically had a token black character with the last name Black. 

Her ""character"" was basically kept on as a bully/foil for all the white people for 8 seasons (they retconned her graduation year by 3 years without any explanation) making her the longest lasting student on the show without ever actually making her a real character. It got so bad that [people were calling this shit out at the time.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltl_v8fk8p4)"
Degrassi: Next Class,"What a glowing tribute. ""I liked his brother"" what a comfort."
Degrassi: Next Class,"Chantay and Dave barely (never?) interacted after Season 9, so making them cousins was pointless. The shit they did with Chantay's character would never fly today. At one point she was the longest running main cast member on the show, and received ONE plot during her entire tenure (and it was a C-Plot)."

Degrassi: Next Class,Everyone chasing the kid that shot Jimmy lmao 
Degrassi: Next Class,I’m upset JT isn’t in the video. RIP
Degrassi: Next Class,[removed]
Degrassi: Next Class,It’s fascinating how they all still look the exact same
Degrassi: Next Class,"It also reignites my crush on Manny, Paige, Emma, Mia and Ashley."
Degrassi: Next Class,Jimmy rose out of that wheel chair and right back into that gymnasium! 
Degrassi: Next Class,"The principal hasn’t aged a day since the pilot in 2001, crazy. "
Degrassi: Next Class,Damn Manny is still bad Af
Degrassi: Next Class,Drake shoulda done the music video in that wheelchair 
Degrassi: Next Class,LMFAO even Jay and Silent Bob made it in. Holy shit as a huge fan of Degrassi back in the day this was incredible from the moment Spinner came on screen till the end when they played the song and showed some old scenes. Glad they stuck to the OG cast too. Amazing 
Degrassi: Next Class,The lesson here is that being on Degrassi makes you hot
Degrassi: Next Class,"Damn, Connor grew *up*."
Degrassi: Next Class,I'm just happy Jay and Silent Bob were in it.
Degrassi: Next Class,Best thing to do after that huge L he got handed from Push...just pretend it didn’t happen lol 
Degrassi: Next Class,Nina dobrev is mad cute
Degrassi: Next Class,Okay but what about a reunion between him and his son
Degrassi: Next Class,This brings back memories. I really enjoyed that show back in the day. I'm pretty sure I was still watching it in my 20's.
Degrassi: Next Class,I.. I need more
Degrassi: Next Class,"I'm not really a fan of drake, but this is awesome. "
Degrassi: Next Class,This is amazing 
Degrassi: Next Class,Was Norm Kelly one of the fire fighters? 
Degrassi: Next Class,This is dope
Degrassi: Next Class,I'm upset that Jimmy could walk. 
Degrassi: Next Class,How did a dead man put out a music video? Push killed that man
Degrassi: Next Class,I'd be upset too if Pusha T hung me out to dry that bad.
Degrassi: Next Class,When news about your secret baby gets out. You gotta do something to make people forget your dirt.
Degrassi: Next Class,But what about his son? Is he in this?
Occupied,"The Russians were using a real-world device that allows you to eavesdrop from outside of a building by measuring sound vibrations in a window pane using a laser. They were pointing it at her goggles, which is why she asked Jesper to take them off.

That seems plausible, but the other team jams the Russians for a second by sweeping a device over them, and that device is just a parabolic mic that wouldn't have an effect like that - those are for listening, not jamming."
Occupied,So many people say You is a guilty pleasure.  Personally I don't feel an ounce of guilt for really enjoying this show.  Just finished season 4 tonight and loved it.  Joe is pure plot armor but honestly I really just don't fucking care.  Stab away Joe.  I'm with you till the end buddy.
Occupied,Joe is the the textbook definition of plot armor. There must be no good lawyers in the you-verse if he’s able to successfully frame so many people
Occupied,First time?
Occupied,did you not pay attention to the part where Joe said he wanted Marianne to be found. so her daughter would have closure?
Occupied,"The writers don't understand Joe's character but you do. 
It's always been you.
You're the only one who understands Joe."
Occupied,"I think this is You's worst season. The whole murder-mystery vibe of the first 5 eps was just okay, but none of those formed into a cohesive ending as the ""killer"" just ""revealed himself by the end of ep 5. None of Joe's investigating has come to a cohesive thought.

With the benefit of hindsight, of course this isn't what really happens (talking about who the killer really is, ep 6 above). But all of the runtime investigating who the eat-the-rich killer was wasted and almost the entire 5 eps felt like they were almost all for nothing. 

Aside from that, the first 5 eps had a weird vibe. I think the writers wanted to change things up, but the generic murder-mystery vibe of the first half made You lose it's identity. It was never like that for the past 3 years.

The 2nd half felt worse. It's almost 5 eps of joe just fighting his inner demon (you-know-who), and the plot just felt like it was pondering up until the 10th ep. I absolutely loved the last half of ep 10 though. The plot twist has been a number of times so it wasn't really a shocker or a game-changer, and it really slowed the pacing down."
Occupied,"I dropped this show after they decided to kill Love and just start the cycle all over again. It was a nice guilty pleasure, but I’m done. The best part of S3 was the brief moments where Joe and Love worked together.

Did they bring Mariane back? Such a dull character when compared to his previous love interests. I couldn’t stand his infatuation with her in S3. I was like, ffs, just focus on Joe and Love."
Occupied,"Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just *needs* to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous.

As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe."
Occupied,"I think you're applying too much real world logic to the show. It's a silly murder comedy drama, not a documentary."
Occupied,I this season 4 was the best season. It was dumb mindless drama. Yeah lot of plot of armor but it’s popcorn tv just set back and enjoy it.
Occupied,Also would he not watch the news to see if they found her body?
Occupied,"I'm going to agree with A LOT of what you said. Hands down the worst season. It didn't get good or interesting until episode 9!! 🤦🏼‍♀️ The whole ""Eat the Rich"" drama was over the top. None of the characters were good. Over the top, bad acting and hey who cares. Zero investment. Yes in season 2 & 3 there were over the top characters but the writing and acting brought them to life. Forty! Loved him! Sherry and Cary! Hysterical! There's no saving the ""Eat the Rich"" crew! No depth and uuuggghhhh so poorly portrayed.

Was taking that storyline sooooo far worth the payoff at the end! Not sure! 9 episodes were wasted. And really why oh why wouldn't Nadia call the police immediately when she found Marianne. And run like hell when she saw Joe!.🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
Occupied,[deleted]
Occupied,"This show is not going for awards. It knows what it wants and executed on it. I love it. I just started, “Your Honor”. The judge is every bit of fuck up like Walter White was. It’s cringey, but I’m sure they know this."
Occupied,What I don’t get is now Joe has multiple personality disorder? Lol it would make sense if that was the case since season 1
Occupied,"I'm just starting to watch season 4. I love the quasi Hercule Poirot whodunit with a established group of suspects in a modern, but traditional English setting. There was even a nod to Agatha Christie in the library! I hope there are more seasons set in Europe.

Binge watched it. Talented writing. Excellent."
Occupied,The blackmailing to kill rhys made no sense because it implied Kate’s dad knew rhys has something on joe. In reality rhys doesn’t know who tf joe is
Occupied,"  
I thought that idea of ""tricking the murderer"" was crazy. The show's reasoning was that he would honor Marianne's wishes and put her where anyone can find her, but who's to say that he actually does that? He could have buried her alive and the plan would have failed. Also the friend was not worried that her friend had not showed up for months on end? I don't buy it.   
  
Also, the whole not calling the cop thing, made not logical sense. Oh well he's going to come after me. Well not if Nadia has images of the ""trophies"" and actually shows the cops where exactly it is. He can be traced back to California and New York. This will be enough information for a full on investigation to take place. The cops are going to have to listen to the couple (black woman and white man) from the previous season. they can confirm that he had them locked in there. This will exonerate the Stamos's character of the murder of the first love interest.   
  
Kate's father character did not make much sense to me. You did ""a lot"" of digging on this guy, something a reverse image search could have accomplished. And all that the dad discovered was the situation with Joe and his former wife, that's it. No links to anymore there or New York. To continue, the father was just ok with it all, and Kate as well, was ok with him being a sociopathy serial killer. This is crazy writing. Really no-one had any smart thinking in this season, it was full of coincidences and dumb decisions.   
  
  
Lady Phoebe's whole storyline was a waste of time. I was thinking that there was going to be a connection with her storyline and Joe's, but nope. She seemed like she was cool with him killing, as long as the body was hidden, crazy. Her going to teach kids at the end was nice, but her and all of the other side characters were a waste of screen time."
Occupied,It took you until season four to realise the writing makes no sense?
Occupied,"your complaints make no sense, ur questioning why a psychopathic killer who was experiencing dissociation killed people because of ""not much rationalization"" and yes not hiding Mariennes body was questionable but to me hiding her body was just extra work that wasnt necessary, he hides bodies that would be linked to him, NOt hiding her body isnt a ""plot twist"" in my opinion"
Occupied,I’m happy with this season tbh. Much better than the coattail riding season of 3 from season 2
Occupied,Anyone think Kate gives Ghislaine Maxwell vibes?
Occupied,Another major plot hole I found ridiculous was the way in which Nadia found Marianne. It seems extremely unrealistic to me that nadia simply saw photos of joe frequently eating at that Indian place and somehow put together exactly where Marianne was . Not to mention the fact that she broke into an extremely observant serial killers home 2x and he didn’t even notice (even tho he had a camera planted in the same room) .
Occupied,"I agree with all the points made by OP. It wasn’t fun to watch (yes, I still did), there were so many plot holes and the fact that they tried to give him a redemption arc and then gave him a happy ending is so old and predictable. Based on how they begun this season, they could’ve ended it so much stronger."
Occupied,"**Could not agree more.** 

I found it painful watching the characters time after time make weird decisions. Joe started as a killer who killed but had thought behind it- in this season he seemed to turn into a psycho with no remorse and now will be killing for fun for Kate? HUUH

Watched it all but MY GOD, disliked the character assassination throughout. They have truely ruined his character, I can only predict the next season:

\- Joe kills for Kate

\- He over steps

\- She confronts him

\- They argue

\- If they want another season: she dies. If they are ending it: he dies. 

&#x200B;

Ez

Was nice to see Love again, though."
Occupied,"I completely agree with you. This season was absolute garbage. Honestly, I was so mad when it was revealed that Rhys was just a figment of Joe’s imagination. It is incredibly cheap- just for shock value. Joe’s behavior does not make sense. Most of the character’s behaviors don’t. Season three Joe literally didn’t kill anyone without a thorough reason (Ryan and Love). He even ended up saving Theo and tried to let Gil free. Now we are supposed to believe that he just kills mindlessly, without reason? They really did assassinate his character. Does Netflix expected us to have forgotten what they laid out in previous seasons? honestly I’m incredibly mad and disappointed."
Occupied,The problem with this season for me is that I hated every character. Even Kate…. No love for her. The first part was ok with the who did it theme. Yeah I’m still a you Stan but this season was just meh for me.
Occupied,It reminded me of the dude that does AHS. Very interesting and pretty good until it has to wrap up and everything gets thrown out the window and you feel like you wasted your time
Occupied,That’s how I felt until this season. It was sooo nonsensical that it wasn’t even fun anymore
Occupied,What was plot armor about joe in this 2nd part? I swear yall love throwing that word around when theres plausable reasons for whatever it is
Occupied,"How many people are going to use the useless phrase ""plot armor"" 😒 use your big words and explain exactly what you mean!"
Occupied,"It's fun to watch a villain do what they do best! It's never been about Joe finding justice or completely believable murders. It's about a twisted man who justifies his actions any way he can.

I think he kills so easily because he's unraveling, and I for one love to see it. I'll also be watching till the end :)"
Occupied,"I like the show a lot but I found it strange how the whole goal for him has been redemption, yet they leaned into him being an evil, non-regretful killer now… I guess I’m confused where they’re gonna go next"
Occupied,Joe has the good lawyers 😂
Occupied,"Not only that but Marianne wrote that in the letter she left for Joe that he read and then burned.

She literally requested that her buddy be found so that her daughter would have closure. 

It was not luck it was all part of the plan to keep her body safe and I guess there OP missed that part."
Occupied,Right. So now she hasn't been found because she got up and left? Surely smart Joe would have realised there was no report of her death. She would have been identified from dental records or maybe even ID on her body as Joe wanted to make sure her daughter got closure?
Occupied,The season 4 love interest will frustrate you even more
Occupied,You should watch it. It will piss you off
Occupied,">Killing Joe was Plan A, faking her death was Plan B. They probably hoped that Joe would leave her in public because a) He still cared about her (even by the end of Season 2 Joe had fallen out of love with Love) and b) Marienne didn’t want her daughter to have hope that she would return, and she knows they share a history of abandonment and living in foster care.

The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience. Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

>Their plan was risky and bonkers but it makes sense that she was paranoid. Her ex-husband had just conveniently died, Love told her to run from Joe, then Joe “dies” in a murder-suicide that everyone thinks was committed by Love, he follows her across an ocean, chases her, lets her go, then kidnaps her and locks her in a glass cage.

No the plan doesn't make sense at all. Too many things could go wrong. You don't get locked up for months and decide to remain locked up with someone that hasn't fed you for a while. There was even no guarantee he would return. The plan to kill a professional could also easily go wrong. 

>The split-personality thing was odd but I feel it can still be rationalized. Joe thinks bad stuff just happens to him or that he just needs to do bad stuff. Splitting Joe into Joe and “Rhys” allows “Rhys” (and making Joe unaware) to do all the brutal, impulsive stuff he’s always had inside of him, while Joe is the rational person left to clean up the mess. When Joe and “Rhys” are forced to work together then we get back to normal Joe: dark yet meticulous

I don't have a  problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire. 

Joe in past seasons never killed for flimsy reasons. Why would Joe kill a drunk girl cos she said: the murders started after he appeared.

No one even took her seriously.

Joe mostly kills for obsession, love or to protect himself or those he loves. Even when he kills bad people, it isn't for flimsy reasons like that.

>As for Tom, he was probably thinking about killing two birds with one stone. He has Joe get rid of Rhys and then uses that to get rid of Joe.

He didn't know enough about Joe. All he knew was that Joe probably killed his wife and had no problems killing when necessary. For a smart businessman, it's far safer to use someone that can't be traced to him. He has done things like this. The show even said he knows how to clean and cover up.

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that"
Occupied,It has to be believable to some degree to be fun to watch. Otherwise it’s magical realism and that’s not what this show was supposed to be.
Occupied,I feel like finding a dead homeless person in a busy city wouldn't rank highly on most news days but who knows.
Occupied,"I know a lot of people disliked Beck when the first season was initially airing, but she had by far and away the most chemistry with Joe, and the writing for her was far stronger than any of the love interests that came after her."
Occupied,I noticed that at the end. They just wanted him back in New York with no credible story on how to get him there
Occupied,"You can't even read and understand what I typed. You just rushed to defend

I said it makes no sense that she would fake her death rather than just escape or call the police. It makes no sense because she had no idea what he would do to her body.

Remember he burnt his ex-wife...there's no guarantee he wouldn't cut up Marienna or bury her

Her gamble makes absolutely no sense especially when you look at the easy option of getting him arrested...which she refused to do because PLOT"
Occupied,"That is what I though too. Nadia had  some pictures and is like, yup this is where he keeps his victims. This was too convenient."
Occupied,"Completely agree, how would you say to end it? I thought they chose the worst option but not sure how I would've wanted it to continue. Almost wish it ended with him killing himself: unsatisfying, but an ending."
Occupied,"There’s going to be another season?!??! People need to stop ruining good things. You’s expiration date was max season three, maybe even two."
Occupied,"The show was adapted from it's books....

But I heard only up to Book 3 has been released...so Netflix went their own way for S4...

Explains the mediocre writing"
Occupied,Felt this after season 3. But I thoroughly enjoyed season 4 more
Occupied,I’m with you. Felt like they killed it this season. This want early joe
Occupied,Seriously. He died but was lucky to get revived from the bay. It is broad daylight but no one sees him slit someone’s throat. His gf is apathetic to him being the one who murdered all her friends and her dad.
Occupied,I was thinking about a news report at least of her body but ya know. ✨️✨️Tv magic✨️✨️
Occupied,">The best plan was to have the police arrest Joe. All these others were hinged on pure luck and plot convenience.

Of course getting the police would be the better plan, but she was traumatized, scared, tired, etc. The only thing that was keeping her going was her daughter. She wanted to get home and make sure the glove-trotting serial killer would never find her again.

>Because he cared for her doesn't mean he couldn't have decided on a proper way to dispose her body. He could have burnt her up like his ex-wife, he left her to starve remember? She could suspect he had Multiple personality disorder

We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though. He didn’t care about burning Love’s dead body because she tried to kill him, he didn’t love her anymore, and he needed a clean slate. He still cares about Marienne enough to grant her final wish. Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

>I don't have a problem with the fixed personality, I have a problem with how it was executed. There was no way Joe would know for sure that Kate would rescue him from the fire.

Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

&#x200B;

For someone so protective of his daughter, no way he lets her hang around someone dangerous like that

He always kept track of all her previous boyfriends and guys she was seeing, and she admitted she used to have a thing for dangerous men. But he said she usually managed to end up losing them or driving them away rather than having to get rid of them himself. Plus it was shown he can control the media. He can erase any connection Joe has to Kate or himself. Having an actual fall guy the media could actually be more helpful than a popular candidate just disappearing out of the blue or showing up dead with no leads."
Occupied,The whole point though was for Marienne to be found and identified for her daughter to get Closure so surely Joe would want to make sure his great plan of leaving her on a bench with a weak pulse definitely worked?
Occupied,And her reaction to finding out his depravity was accurate
Occupied,Agreed. I think they set it up for another season... I guess we shall see.
Occupied,That makes sense
Occupied,"So do you not know how the real world works. As stated in the show there are people watching the area because its a popular spot for people to jump from. And do you not believe in medicine or science? From personal experience i can tell you people survive drowning. When i was like 16 i got pulled out to sea and was basically dead, but here i am writing this. The only unrealistic thing about that scenario was how fast his recovery time was.

Did you not see the body was hidden in a non populated area behind a car with trees around. Its not that hard to understand…. He didnt just kil him in the middle of a busy highway 

Joe never said he killed all her friends and dad. He only specified that he killed people before. And we know kate is not all the way sane either. She is used to her father disappearing people (killing them) she herself gave kids cancer. And she did dispose of a body previously with joe. She loves him and so she accepts him. 

Im really trying to understand how this is plot armor to u, its not rocket science."
Occupied,Good point on that. Just another thing to move the story along. unfortunately...
Occupied,">We’re talking about after Marienne had already “died” though.

Plus she had a history of drug use, so dumping her on a park bench wouldn’t raise any red flags.

This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.


>Yes, in previous season before he went off the deep end and started thinking he was engaging with a secret killer who was running for mayor of London and had memory lapses. Once he realizes what’s going on he’s no longer killing for flimsy reasons.

This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.

Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice"
Occupied,"My man was a serial killer walking around in broad daylight, who just so happened to end up with a billionaire girlfriend that was okay with him killing at least one person that she personally knew. It's also absolutely bonkers that he committed all of those murders himself and never got caught. Like the police in London must be absolute dipshits to not put 2 and 2 and 2 and 2 together. Also the absolutely stupidest part of the entire season was Nadia not calling the cops immediately when she found Marianne. Like her being a little Nancy Drew and conveniently fucking the whole thing up was just incredibly lucky for Joe, and the show even hinted at his plot armor here. ""If you call the cops on him he'll just weasel away again."" I'm sorry but Joe is one of the most plot armored characters I've ever seen in fiction."
Occupied,">This is such a huge gamble on her part. That's why it's irrational. It relies solely on plot convenience.

I’m not denying that it‘s a gamble or irrational. I’m just saying she’s a traumatized, desperate woman trying to make sure her serial killer kidnapper/stalker can never come looking for her again.

>This right here is a problem. Having MPD doesn't change the fact that he's smart to cover up his tracks. Killing randomly for no good reason doesn't make sense.

Of course not, he’s crazy. He thinks a guy whose book he read and is running for mayor is blackmailing him.

Also I’d argue that he’s *always* smart enough to cover his tracks. When he’s more stable he comes up with it on his own. But when he’s split into Joe and “Rhys”, his mind rationalizes the importance of cleaning up his own messes by coming up with  blackmail schemes and avoiding being “framed.”

&#x200B;

>Your political rival being killed by the guy who your daughter is dating isn't an ideal situation. There was no way using Joe was a better choice

If Tom was running for mayor I’d agree, but he’s just financially backing Rhys’s political opponent. Plus, like I said, he can bury stories. No one knows Kate was responsible for children getting cancer when she was 19. If the media found out Joe killed Rhys, who would look deeper into Joe and Kate? Joe’s only friends are Kate’s friends. They barely know him, and they’re all too self-absorbed or too dead to cause a fuss in the media. Plus they would want to protect Kate anyway."
Occupied,"Your a clown right. Your mad about the plot of you? The fact that he met kathryn a woman with a rich dad? He litteraly stalked her at first it was bound to happen. Do you know how many murders arent caught? Its a higher number thank you would think. What 2 and 2 are the police supposed to put together exactly? With the fire at the masion joe was also almost killed so thats good cover. Joe doesnt know rhys so they suspect him of killing him. Nadia wanted to call the police you dumbass. That was her first instinct but marienne (however u spell it) told her no because she knows joe is smart and can get out of tricky spots or flee. How did nadia fuck it up??? She litteraly helped her escape the cage. It was just her need to see justice putting a serial killer away that got her caught.  You can litterally do your own research instead of bitchin.“Often, a serial killer kills for quite some time and they get sloppy but in general the sloppiness is a result of a mental/emotionally spiraling out of control.” There are lots of murderers and killers that we walk by everyday and have no idea because they seem like the “average joe”. It seems your just mad that he keep getting away, but if you used your brain you can connect the dots on how he gets things done. Also at the end of the day this is a fiction show, every show gives character luck or some amount of plot armor to do what they do"
Occupied,"** The one thought that keeps stumping me. Is that at Rhys announcing his candidacy for mayor. Fruitcake crazy, Dawn takes a picture of both Rhys and Joe standing next to each other. 

So does that mean that since they've been seen together... There's a good chance it wasn't just Joe by himself. All along?"
Occupied,Lmao you seem like the only mad one in the conversation. Imagine glorifying a TV program so much that you would write an entire essay to defend it’s ridiculous plot points that make absolutely no sense in the real world.
Occupied,now book a therapist for sessions and start watching Neon Genesis Evangelion.
Occupied,Now go watch Monster.
Occupied,"If you’re into philosophy/politics or want to watch the best space opera, then watch Legend of the galactic heroes (not the remake, the new one sucks)"
Occupied,AOT was also my first anime ☺️
Occupied,"If you're enjoying Vinland Saga, you should check out the author's other work, Planetes. It's about a crew of astronauts picking up space debris in a future where spaceflight is still fairly new and not exactly high science fiction, but also advanced enough where orbital debris has become a serious concern. Like Vinland Saga, it's very character focused and follows a ragtag group hanging on the bottom rung of the corporate ladder.

+1 on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, as well. It's faster paced, and action oriented, but like Vinland Saga, the best part of it lies in the characters and their journey. Personally I like at how adeptly the author manages to keep the main characters and side characters moving in separate circles throughout the story and unwinding different parts of a greater mystery on their own.

If you like AoT, I might suggest Gundam as well, though that can be a very long road to go down since it's such a long-running franchise. I would suggest Gundam: Thunderbolt to experiment with, since despite being part of a larger canon, it's short and self-contained story about two soldiers on the opposite sides of a nearly-finished war, fighting over the remnants of a destroyed space colony."
Occupied,"I'll never understand how something mid like AoT gets such a passionate fanbase.  
If you want something truly amazing try FMA: brotherhood."
Occupied,how anime/manga depicts feelings in the most earnest ways is one of the reasons why I've been loving them for 30 years. When I read Video Girl Ai at 17 it nearly destroyed me
Occupied,I've felt that way too. Then I think of shows like Fairy Tail exist and I remember all other anime has been drained of artistic value by association.
Occupied,"I want to watch ""MONSTER"" for a long time. but +60 series is a lot for me 😮"
Occupied,"Wow, I love Planetes and not a big anime guy. So I'll probably try and watch Vinland now.

I will also recommend Wings of Honnemaise (sp?) for a movie if you enjoy Planetes."
Occupied,"Love Vinland Saga and decided to give Planetes a try and very much enjoyed the first episode. Being a sci-fi nerd and a lover of good animation i think i'm gona enjoy this one.

+1 on Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. Great show."
Occupied,"+1000 for Fullmetal. It's an annual re-watch for me. AoT is a bimonthly re-watch for me. Yep, I just like it that much, lol.

I tried to get into the Gundam franchise but instead of starting out with the mainline series, I watched Iron Blooded Orphans first and it was fucking awesome. I couldn't really get into the other series though but IBO was fantastic."
Occupied,"Great suggestions, thank you! I hadn’t heard of Planetes and that description sounds like something I’d enjoy a lot, thanks for that one especially, if it has a similar standard of writing to Vinland I’ll be very pleased."
Occupied,"AoT does have its flaws, especially when it comes to character writing; I think Eren’s development is terrific and while I thought he was a bit boring at first, his character goes places I never even thought of. I would have liked to see more from Mikasa and Armin though, especially Mikasa. The rest of the Scout Regiment can be kind of one note, but Jean had good development though and Reiner became one of my favorite characters in the show once you learn about his conflicting loyalties. I kind of forgive it though because the constant twists and set pieces are absolutely incredible; the basement reveal, the Shiganshina fight, about half of the episodes of season 4, etc. were all fantastic. I like how morally grey it all becomes and I think just because it was the first anime I sat down and really watched it hit different for me. 

I’ll definitely be checking out FMA: Brotherhood at some point, I know it’s really highly regarded."
Occupied,"I liked AOT more than Fma ( first 2004 ) 

AOT is the best"
Occupied,The first opening lives rent free in my mind
Occupied,Because they talk like you with phrasing such as 'If you really want something amazing..'
Occupied,Possibly the worst ending ever. By the end of it I was so grossed out by the nationalistic and facist themes and subtext of the story. The author is pro genocide with his reverence for mass murdering generals and sweeping all the atrocities of japan under the rug. If thats how he feels then keep it out of your art or it can't be separated.
Occupied,Watch both series and compare them lol. It's like comparing fine dining to McDonalds.
Occupied,"This is a problem with you not understanding the manga lol, not the manga itself."
Occupied,No its about Isayama´s incompetence. You can go [read up](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/18/18683609/attack-on-titan-fascist-nationalist-isayama-hajime-manga-anime) on all the facist themes and subtext.
Occupied,"Lmao y’all are delusional. There are fascist themes in aot, but that doesn’t mean isayama is endorsing those themes. He’s showing how fascism arises and what situations lead to fascism. AoT fanbase is easily the worst anime fanbase lol"
Occupied,"He even apologised for the ending. Theres no need to defend it, not even the author himself is.

And Griffith is not a racist but that doesn´t erase the fact that he made Birth of a Nation which is a racist movie. He even followed it up with Tolerance but the damage was already done. Whether deliberate or plain incompetence thats whats being portrayed.

Isayama is super nationalistic, and denies korean genocide. Even names one of the good guys after generals responsible for these atrocities and crimes against humanities. Says thats his hero. Imagine naming the mentor in your story after Goebbels and honor that character."
Occupied,"He did not apologize for the ending lol. And again, portraying fascism does not mean you support fascism. What a dumb comment lol"
Occupied,"Yes he [did](https://www.dexerto.com/anime/attack-on-titan-creator-apologizes-for-controversial-ending-im-really-sorry-2001344/). If you don´t have any arguments to defend it, then why even comment?"
Occupied,Him saying sorry has nothing to do with fascism lol. He’s saying sorry bc he knows some fans will be upset.
Occupied,"Its not about whether you portray facism or not, its *how* you portray it.

He´s sorry because he´s not sure he did it right. Its literally in the link but you couldn´t even bother to read it. This pointless, have a good one."
Occupied,"There’s literally nothing in the link that says he portrayed fascism the wrong way lol. Please quote me where he said that.

And he portrays it just fine, only the illiterate think he’s supporting fascism lol"
Occupied,"Hi. I'll try to answer.

I don't think they always change. On The Original Series there were several actors that were regularly in the background or used for playing small roles. Yes, there were even actors as redshirts that got killed more than once. And there are different types of extras. Most extras come in for a day or two on an episode by episode basis, and will just be put at whatever station that helps make the screen look like it's filled with activity. Sometimes there are a small core group of regular extras that will appear in multiple episodes throughout the season and get paid a little more. I worked a background office worker extra on a TV show for two seasons. On the show Two Broke Girls, some of the regular diner patrons pulled double duty and worked as stand-in's for the main actors during set ups.

Day players (actors with one or more lines) are different. But, like extras, day players are not under a contract, so their appearances are subject to their availability. Basically Trek has always reused actors and does put some effort into trying to retain them, though it's not always possible, and keeping them at the same stations all the time is obviously not a priority."
Occupied,The guys in the red shirts who beam down with the landing party are not good candidates for recurring roles.
Occupied,"I do background acting on shows and movies. Some tv show directors are very particular about background, like to hand select them and are adamant in the casting calls about ""only fresh faces "" meaning you had not worked on camera on that production.

I think it just helps with authenticity in their mind. In practice, it doesn't make a huge difference to the average viewer."
Occupied,"I think the various Star Treks do try to keep some sense of recurring extras. Voyager did this as much as they could due to the premise of the show. TNG tended to stick to a handful of day players for the helm position and various other background crew. DS9 had Morn. Discovery's bridge crew has more or less stayed the same since the beginning, existing in a weird state somewhere between day player and actual cast.

It's also not a fixed crew, other than Voyager and Discovery because of their unique circumstances. Realistically, most of the crew would only serve a few years at most at a single post before being transferred and/or promoted somewhere else."
Occupied,"Spock and Riker had the job of creating the work schedules.  If it was ALWAYS the same person at the same console that credibility goes down (like Tom Paris, Harry Kim, and Tuvok on Voyager though they were in a situation where they literally couldn't pick up a new qualified Starfleet officer.)"
Occupied,"They keep getting into the teletransporter with Kirk, Spock, and Scotty, which is the Kiss of Death...Nobody can survive that!!"
Shadowhunters,Liked the books but honestly couldn't get past the first couple episodes. Sucks for the fans though.
Shadowhunters,Wasn’t this like the only popular show Freeform had?
Shadowhunters,"Huh, I thought this show was pretty popular. I'm always glad to hear that a show gets a resolution though. 
"
Shadowhunters,"Netflix asked freeform for the rights of the show, freeform declined and in turn Netflix pulled their money. 

It's sad to see that shows suffer due to networks and producers disagreements, not because the show is bad and unpopular. There are certainly worse shows on TV and clearly it is popular amongst young people. "
Shadowhunters,"I'm honestly SHOCKED. Last time I checked, the SH fanbase is huge, Twitter is already in a frenzy, what happened? This was one of Freeform's prized jewels popularity-wise, and honestly put them on the map post ABC Family IMO. I thought they cared more about the show than to treat it like this, same goes to Netflix. I seriously doubt anyone else will pick it up, Freeform was the perfect network. Even without them backing, ABC couldn't fork over the money for a final season at least? Makes me worry even more about Famous In Love's future :'(

But SERIOUSLY, THEY'RE CANCELLING ALL THEIR SHOWS FOR FIRST RUN LIKELY FLOPS! What do they have left besides Cloak and Dagger and Perfectionists, a couple more seasons of Bold Type and maybe one more of Siren?

Incredibly ironic they cancel during pride, considering how much LGBT rep is in the show. It's also pretty funny how 90% of their (best) shows in this PRIDE promo have gotten the axe: https://youtu.be/f2tcWYXp0Is

I truly wonder how much longer Freeform will last as a network."
Shadowhunters,God damn it. Everything I enjoy gets cancelled.
Shadowhunters,I wish they could have just gotten a 10 episode final season to wrap up. I know they've got a two episode finale but that's a lot of stuff to cover if they're planning on doing book 6.
Shadowhunters,Tried to get into this. The lead actress was REALLY bad. 
Shadowhunters,Shame!
Shadowhunters,"2-Hour finale to wrap up. That's not done often enough. Kudos Freeform. Never watched an episode od this show, but I am sure fans are grateful. "
Shadowhunters,Hearing about the Shadowhunters cancellation is surprising. It was probably the most viewed show they have before Pretty Lies Liars went off the air.
Shadowhunters,"Well, that sucks. Another well-produced/written show cancelled. Like aphetto_grifter says, everything I enjoy gets cancelled. Sounds like there's not going to be a way for another network to pick it up."
Shadowhunters,"It didn’t get cancelled because of ratings, it got cancelled because of funding. Netflix pulled their deal with Freeform and Freeform can’t afford to fund it. "
Shadowhunters,"Noooooo, this is my favorite show to watch drunk. :("
Shadowhunters,"Honestly, the first season was really bad but around the second half of season 2 imo it gets really good. "
Shadowhunters,It’s not that popular. It’s just a melodramatic teen show.
Shadowhunters,"LOL Constantin films owns the rights to the show not Freeform. With it axed, Netflix could easily swooped in to save the show. Their Netflix deal was the one funding the show. Netflix dumped them hence why Freeform cannot afford to produce it anymore. For a show to get dump by Netflix means they're not performing well in their platform. This Netflix who has money burn. "
Shadowhunters,I strongly doubt that's what happened. That's not really how the industry works. 
Shadowhunters,"That's so dumb, I feel like the show would suit Netflix and bring in a whole new audience too. Smh, a bad decision on Freeform's part"
Shadowhunters,It’s a shit show anyways.
Shadowhunters,Freeform wants shadowhunters so badly they are pushing for a finale. Its the Netflix deal that fucked everything. 
Shadowhunters,I'm disappointed too. I have to assume there was some behind the scenes business reason why they had to drop the show. It does sound like they're trying to cap things off as best they can though with the 2-hour finale.
Shadowhunters,"hulu had the us rights, maybe they'll save it. The Bold Type is so good i hope freeform doesn't touch it."
Shadowhunters,"[We're still getting the 2nd half of Season 3](https://deadline.com/2018/06/shadowhunters-canceled-end-after-3-seasons-freeform-2-hour-finale-2019-air-date-1202403122/), which is going to include that 2 hour finale. 3B was supposed to be 10 episodes, but Freeform extended it to 12 so they could do that finale to wrap everything up."
Shadowhunters,Yeah I felt like it could've been the case but I'm too old for all that teenage drama unfortunately. Maybe I'll give it a chance again.
Shadowhunters,"True,  im checking my sources bc yeah the Netflix funding was important (freeform  and constantin can only produce two more episodes??). But the why they cut it, it's all speculation and I found out deeply at night (it's still deep at night tbh). "
Shadowhunters,"What?! That’s not at all what happened. Netflix wanted longer seasons ‘cause it’s better for them in the long-run, FF declined, and wanted to stick with short seasons, hence they (Netflix) cut their funding."
Shadowhunters,Netflix already has the international release rights. It's so sad.
Shadowhunters,"I wonder why Netflix dropped it, I’ve never heard of them doing something like that before :("
Shadowhunters,"""Freeform had been in negotiations with Constantin Films, a co-producer of the show, to produce fewer episodes to make room for the channel's other projects. But that plan jeopardized an existing deal with Netflix, which owns streaming rights for the series outside the U.S. and pays a large portion of the show's production costs.""

From USA Today.

Sounds like it was Freeform mainly."
Shadowhunters,Bullshit! Netflix prefers thing short. 12/13 maxed. Look at all the new shows coming. Netflix did not want Shadowhunter hence why they dumped it. Hello! This is Netflix. They can easily afford this cheap-ass show. They have all the money in the world to burn.
Shadowhunters,They dropped it because it's horrible. Try listening to that dialogue without considering the violent puncturing of your own eardrums.
Shadowhunters,"Cause netflix wanted longer seasons, but ff refused."
Shadowhunters,"I read that article yesterday night. Yeah... Both companies have interests that left the show cancelled. On one hand freeform is using a prime timeslot for a show they don't own, and on the other freeform being owned by Disney is leaving Netflix negotiating with their own competition for a new deal that benefits Disney more than them. "
Shadowhunters,"I'm really hoping that Freeform will just sell the rights. I heard a rumor on Twitter that Netflix, Hulu and Fox are fighting over it. It's Twitter and a rumor so I'm taking it with a grain of salt and not getting my hopes up but I seriously think the show is too popular to just throw away like that. I mean the cancelation surprised *everyone*. "
Shadowhunters,"To be honest, of all the fan campaigns, this one has been the most productive. Instead of sending shit to the producers (socks, Tabasco sauce, flip flops, etc), they donated money to charity."
Shadowhunters,rubbing salt in the wound
Shadowhunters,"Now that’s funny. The Shadowhunters campaign just seems ridiculous. I don’t know how they’ve done it but I’ve seen [this bus](https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/851/935/nat-shows.jpg?downsize=1280px:*) going around parts of South London for months.



We’re in Lewisham. Surely this would’ve been a better idea in America?"
Shadowhunters,If they really want more Shadowhunters they could always go ahead and read all those shitty YA books themselves. Normally you lament a cancellation because there's no way to continue the story.
Shadowhunters,"Lol that’s pretty funny. But then again I would be pissed if it happened with a show I loved, like American Vandal."
Shadowhunters,"The fans should actually give Siren a shot instead of belaboring this. It’s another supernatural Freeform show that was surprisingly great, and as a show about mermaids that has elements of horror, it’s pretty unique too. "
Shadowhunters,Awkward....
Shadowhunters,Sounds like Shadowhunters fans should get over it.
Shadowhunters,Freeform is the failed attempt to compete with Adult Swim. Pathetic.
Shadowhunters,Don’t know the details surrounding his. Can anyone elaborate?
Shadowhunters,The books suck. The show is full of hot guys and is great to watch while drunk.
Shadowhunters,If you read the article you can figure it out pretty easily.
Shadowhunters,"so earlier this year they cancelled Shadowhunters during pride month (show has really popular M/M ship) so fans were annoyed and stuff but campaigned a lot for a renewal. So during the airing of Toy Story they had blurbs about behind the scenes stuff about Toy Story. But randomly in a scene were someone uses a magic 8 ball they decide to have a blurb asking"" if i tweet will freeform save shadow hunters"" and the 8 ball in the movie was like ""don't count on it."""
Shadowhunters,"Seems like a selfish and bad reason to keep a show going past it's prime

"
Shadowhunters,"[Nah, I don't really FEEL like it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPsk2OJChIg)"
Shadowhunters,Outlook good
Shadowhunters,That would imply the show has a prime. It isn't an amazing show. It is your typical Disney show but with magic and LGBT characters. That is the main reason it has such a hardcore fanbase. It has actual LGBT characters that are not going to [be killed for drama](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays). It also has many POC characters that are not stereotypes.
Shadowhunters,"I seem to be getting downvoted for pointing out the logical flaw for pointing out that keeping a show only because people in it are ""hot"" is a problem if the rest of the show sucks

By prime I mean ""prime viewership"" btw"
Shadowhunters,"I always see this complaint about LGBT characters being killed for drama. Maybe I'm watching the wrong shows, but I can't think of many instances of this (I remember it being a big deal with a character on the 100, but as I recall that was just because the actress decided she was leaving the show and they had to write her out somehow). Just to be clear, I want to see good representation of these characters, I just feel like I'm living in a different reality, because I've never seen this trope."
Shadowhunters,I didn't say that was the only reason to keep the show. I actually gave you MORE reasons why people want the show to be kept around.
Shadowhunters,The tvtropes link has a lot of examples. 
Shadowhunters,You wanna watch a show with an amazing LGBTQ+ relationship? WATCH BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER😂♥️
Shadowhunters,"Well yes. After the fact.

But initially all it sounds like the show has going for it is hot guys and you can drink while watching it. With that knowledge you might as well be talking about a 1313 movie for all I know."
Shadowhunters,"1. Lots of characters die in lots of shows. I'm not saying I believe gay characters don't die, just that it doesn't seem to happen at a faster rate than any other characters in most shows I'm familiar with on this list. Two that really stuck out to me were the 100 (people are constantly dying on that show, and a lot of it is due to actors leaving), and downton abbey (politically backwards and celebrates the aristocracy in a gross way, but, come on, so many characters die for no reason or because of actors leaving on that show).

2. Like half of the entries on that page seem to be subversions of the trope rather than the trope itself. I don't doubt that it happened a lot at one time, but I really don't see a lot of evidence in modern television. "
Shadowhunters,I was (facetiously) explaining why the show is better than the books.
Shadowhunters,It makes kinda sense though. LGBT characters are/were often not main characters. If you have to kill someone you kill the supporting characters. 
Shadowhunters,"Oh.

Well then this misunderstanding has been entirely on me and I apologize for that."
Shadowhunters,No problem!
Shadowhunters,At least Freeform was nice enough to do this for the fans
Shadowhunters,"Good. I really liked this show and I'm sad that it didn't make financial sense to continue it, but at least the network gave the writers plenty of notice about its cancellation so that they could wrap it up as best as they can."
Shadowhunters,I tried to watch this before but its so cringey and the fx terrible. My only surprise is it lasted this long.
Shadowhunters,"That's cool for people who watch that show, I've never seen it. That runtime counts commercials I'd assume.

"
Shadowhunters,Same. The lead actress' acting is terrible. 
Shadowhunters,"...and let's not even get started on re-naming a channel ""Freeform"". Wth is a ""Freeform""? Save that for another thread. Lol. "
Shadowhunters,"Oh Sweet! Thanks for the Family Heirloom mom! I'm totally bringing this seemingly fragile ancient family item to a totally banging rock concert!"""
Shadowhunters,"I'll start by saying that I've watched the first two episode, since the second episode got released online. It was much better than the first, which is not really saying much, sadly.

I can't imagine what it must be like trying to keep up with this show without having read the books. It's just...a wreck. I'm not just saying this because I'm upset that it's different from the books, either. I don't mind that Luke is cop instead of a bookstore owner. I don't mind Maureen and Dorothea's expanded roles, or the changes to the functionality of the Institute.

I do mind how rushed it feels. The first episode should have ended with Clary in the apartment after killing the demon. There shouldn't have been any flashbacks. In trying to cram so much exposition into the first few episodes, the producers lost the fish-out-of-water, coming-of-age elements that would have helped viewers sympathize with Clary and learn about the Shadow World in a natural, organic way.

In the books, the dialogue was funny and natural. The kids talked like snarky little bastards who got raised on Whedon and the Internet. Jace's ""Broody Anti-Hero"" was offset by his self-aware Peter Pan cockiness. Here he's just a Cullen knockoff. In the books, Isabelle a woman who's one of the best fighters of her generation, but who struggles in the face of an archaic society that until recently has severely limited women's roles. Here, she's a boring femme fatale with a godawful accent that is not shared with her brother. I'm actually glad that Alec and Magnus are barely present. Hopefully the show will get better before their arcs start kicking off.

Meanwhile, clunky Twitter references are r/fellowkids material and the writing is just terrible. McNamara seems to think she's on Pretty Little Liars because that's how melodramatic, soapy, and unconvincing her emotions are. Dominic Sherwood, also known as ""That guy from Taylor Swift's 'Style' Video"", brings that same level of charisma and charm to Shadowhunters. Even the adult actors don't have it together. The actress who plays Jocelyn gets off easy because her role gets to be comatose for the next several episodes/seasons and limit the degree to which she is associated with the show. Valentine, meanwhile, kills his valued lackeys to prove stupid points and hangs out in Chernobyl. Because I guess the Shadowhunters have a rune that makes them immune to radiation poisoning.

I really wanted to like this and I'm pretty sad I can't. I hope it gets better, but I doubt it will, because I can't imagine it even getting through this season without cancellation."
Shadowhunters,Everybody on this show is ridiculously good looking. 
Shadowhunters,"I had a lot of problems with the book. (Really. A LOT. Those books were like re-branded fanfiction level of writing.) But still they were somehow better than this mess that combines the cheap storylines with an even cheaper look.

I like Alec and Simons actors so far but everyone else isn't doing much for me. Ultimately this has the same problem the books had: Slamming random fantasy tropes, ""cool"" scenarios and ideas and expositionary dialogue into every goddamn scene. The characters are basically walking, snarking narrators that guide you through the juvenile fantasy world that the autor created. ""Hey, here's our cool magical tattoos. Look at our cool magical sword. Wow, were invisible. Look at our cool command center. BTW we're super magical demon hunters and so are you and so is your mother and so is everyone and there's this evil dude that's basically magical Hitler and he is looking for the super ancient, mystical cup that your mother must have hidden because of the special powers and now... "" NO, fuck off. That is not story telling, that is brainstorming with writing to much down. Yeah, there are no bad ideas during brainstorming but afterwards you are supposed to trim the stupid stuff. 

Also. [me @ Clary's hair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXx489yL6PE)."
Shadowhunters,I quite liked it to be  honest! I expected it to be much cringier after seeing the trailers but it surpassed my expectations. And much better than the movie. Definitely watching the next couple of episodes! 
Shadowhunters,"3 Weeks ago i read all the books so everything what happend in the books is fresh in my mind. And the Series is so far away from the book that it is ridiculous!
The books was a success. Why changing ""everything""? I can not understand the film industry. It is not the first time that they tried to change the plot or the Characters to make it ""better"" and failed big time. 
If a book is successful they should try to convert it as close as possible. Any attempt to change the plot or the Characters can (and most of the time it will) ruin the spirit of the story.
I think that even the film was more or less faithful to the spirit of the novels than this Series. 
Its a shame! It could be a really good Series! But now i am sure that it will get cancelled and nobody will touch the story again. :("
Shadowhunters,"So bad, I had to struggle to finish it. The whole show just feels incredibly childish and immature as far as writing (both plot and dialogue) and acting go. I'm talking the level of your average Disney Channel series. Which isn't bad if that's really the only audience you're shooting for, but i remember a time not that long ago when similar shows like this tried to appeal to adults as well and were a lot more succesful for it (*cough* Buffy *cough*)."
Shadowhunters,"I loved the books, forgave the film because despite its glaring issues, it had a beautiful look and was more or less faithful to the spirit of the novels. But this is swill. The acting is terrible, the progression of the plot is laughable, Hodge is young and hot, the institute is a high-tech dojo, Dorothea is also, shockingly, young and hot, and Clary's hair is obviously a wig. I think my biggest concern is a recurrent one; why, in no adaptation, can they not just give Valentine white hair?"
Shadowhunters,[deleted]
Shadowhunters,"Just a collection of notes from my first viewing of episode 1 from like 5 mins ago.

* Ugh, the cgi is crap, I can forgive it if the story picks the fuck up

* I know some people will say Seraph blades look too much like 
lightsabers but IDGAF they actually look cool (especially Jocyln's)

* Ok, the fight in the Pandemonium club was pretty shit, I mean from the cringe-worthy pushing of the shapeshifter to the fact that you could visibly see that Izzy wasn't actually hitting shit, it was pretty bad.

* Nice to see Simon actually gets to be funny, can we have more humour, please???

* Sure, it doesn't look like it's supposed to, but the institute looks fucking awesome, that tracking shot of them walking through was awesome.

* Before the Jocyln vs Circle member fight, I was chanting under my breath ""Please fucking let this be good"" and... It was actually really awesome.

* Why did we need all those flashbacks? Could we just have started a story that made some damn sense for non book readers?

I have a load more but I'm gonna watch the second episode now."
Shadowhunters,Just noticed that it was releasing weekly on netflix in Canada if anyone is interested.
Shadowhunters,Had this in my schedule to watch then read a bad review then decided to wait for more feedback from the general public. To watch or not to watch? 
Shadowhunters,"I couldn't get passed the first commercial break. I loved the book series, but this was not good."
Shadowhunters,Is it as bad as the movie?
Shadowhunters,"This show totally ran under my nose, looking forward watching it on netflix later on. I guess no one posted trailers on this subreddit either"
Shadowhunters,"Wow, this reminds me of some bad series from the '90s. The script is really a joke, and the storyflow more of a todo-list then a real buildup. The acting is on most parts not very good and the CGI is very...limited. Overall the show mught have some serious budget-problems, or just really really shitty producer. But what really sucks is the fake redhead. Come on guys, we are living in the future and people are still failing to color their hairs?"
Shadowhunters,"Yeah, this is pretty bad.  Bad acting, bad writing (oh god, none of the characters were relatable at all), bad cgi.  The magic looked cooler than the movie at least, and Jocelyn's fight was good.

I think the fact that they're going away from the book is a good thing, especially if they wanted to make this a tv series.  The lore's interesting enough to do some monster-of-the week type episodes while the overarching story is finding the mortal cup/finding Jocelyn. 

Too bad it's shit so far.  Hopefully it'll get better but judging by the script and the acting, it's a longshot :( "
Shadowhunters,I once had a bit of respect for the netflix ⭐️ Rating system... Those days are done.
Shadowhunters,"I felt like there was 100 scenes in this one episode and they all felt so short. This was bad. Seeing in the previews that Hodge is a ridiculously, young, hot man was not what I expected."
Shadowhunters,"Firstly, Some people are saying that this was better than the movie, okay no, yes the movie wasnt great but at least they could fickjng act!!!

Now that thats out of the way, i am only watching this show now for malec. Mainly alec really, the hottest actor in the show, and the best actor, though that doesnt really say much when your comparing to this cast.
I hate clary and jace so much its not even funny. I loved them in the book bjt this series is destroying them. Jace just met her, she has been consionce for about 5 hours of the time his been woth her and he is already practically in love with her and letting her come between him and alec WHO ARE FUCKING PARAPATAI! What the hell. Alec is right to be doing what he is doing.
I dont even know how they could have fucked this uk so much seeing as the books were great. They have failed at the movie and the tv series.
I understand and am alright with the plot changes...but intruducing all this information in the secknd episode js just so stupid. Its way to rushed. And the smount of times i cringe during each episode is rediculous, i dont even know why i bother watching this, really its just jn hopes it gets better, for alec and kinda magnus, and eventually sebby.
They had better not stuff up sebby. And the way there going he'll probably be introduced in the first season. I really doubt there will be any more than 1 season."
Shadowhunters,"I wonder what was on the list of choices that ""freeform"" was the best option. "
Shadowhunters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-ckIv1tiaU
Shadowhunters,"I agree with everything you've said having seen episode one. I can't believe they failed in the exact same way the film did. How did they not go ""my god, we have a second chance here!"" and study the hell out of the terrible film for a list of things not to do?

""Let's explain a complex world in a way that assumes our audience has already read the books and if they haven't, can absorb everything in mere minutes."" 

The luxury of TV is that it gives your story time. You don't have to explain everything straight away. It allows things to happen more naturally and people might understand what the hell is going on. I was confused and I've read the books. 

The upsetting thing here is a TV show based on these books *should* be good. It will get cancelled and nobody will touch the property again and it's a wasted opportunity. "
Shadowhunters,Yeah I can't believe how much they rushed everything. They took a lot of mystery out of the show pretty fast.
Shadowhunters,Freeform's trying to go after the CW demographic
Shadowhunters,"Trained assassins

And not just the male models"
Shadowhunters,They were re-branded fanfiction. They started out as Harry Potter fanfic. The fanfics were pretty controversial as people found parts that were lifted directly from other works such as Buffy. The fanfics were re-written into the books.
Shadowhunters,">Those books were like re-branded fanfiction level of writing.

And it doesn't help that the main character is literally named after the author... Mary Sue anyone?"
Shadowhunters,">3 Weeks ago i read all the books so everything what happend in the books is fresh in my mind.

That seems like woefully bad idea before watching the adaptation of any book...

There will never be complete fidelity between film/television and their novel counterparts, it just isn't possible. You have to always go into an adaptation anticipating (for the most part drastic) changes. 

The biggest issue with the show isn't the lack of fidelity to the books, since we have to base our expectations on the fact that there will be differences between the two. It's like how the Marvel Cinematic Universe differs drastically from the comic books its based on, you kind of have to think about what you're watching as new stories with the same characters/ideas. 

TBH, the show's real problem is the abysmal writing and hammy acting."
Shadowhunters,"i read the books years ago. actually maybe i only read the first one or two. but it's definitely not fresh at any rate. so i'm not bothered by changes really. but man the script and acting are sub-par. i even said aloud ""this is the worst tv show i have ever watched"" mid-episode. it's fun enough but it's trash, even when you aren't bummed out by changes. hopefully it gets better! and at least 90% of the characters are hot af"
Shadowhunters,I'm sticking with it to see if it improves but I feel the acting is under par from the typical ABC Family shows have been. I hope Free Form doesn't lose the quality of shows we had. 
Iris,Well that's disappointing. :(
Iris,Bummer.  I do love that Gate World still exists in 2022.
Iris,"There’s gotta be a Stargate show or movie in the pipeline. The franchise has a sturdy following, and is owned by Amazon now. They’d be foolish not to spin out some content from it. Maybe this project didn’t make it for some reason, but I will be really surprised if Amazon doesn’t do anything at all."
Iris,"That is too bad, but at the same time, I don't know if I would want more Stargate unless they had something truly new on their hands or some different take on it. Between all three series and the movies, there is more than enough Stargate out there to rewatch and enjoy."
Iris,"Every time someone almost gets a new one going, MGM gets sold. Did the Origins people loot an actual Egyptian tomb and get them cursed or something?"
Iris,"I know lots of fans disagree, but I just don't think a continuation of the franchise is really a feasible idea. You've got 17 seasons worth of canon that most of your prospective audience doesn't know, and you've basically already burned through all your major villains and massively advanced Earth to the point of being a major intergalactic superpower. The appeal of the original premise was that you had a group of ordinary modern Americans being thrown into crazy sci-fi scenarios while still having one foot in the real world and cracking relatable jokes about politics and pop culture. That and Earth being a major underdog were two ways in which it distinguished itself from Star Trek. The farther the franchise gets from those ideas, the more it just becomes generic Star Trek Lite, which is less interesting. So I can understand Amazon not wanting to go in that direction, but I do hope they do something with the rights."
Iris,Boo
Iris,That’s too bad.
Iris,"The orifice is shut.

What? We call it that sometimes...don't we?"
Iris,"I feel like it's time for a reboot with fresh ideas honestly.  They became overly formulaic, until SGU that is."
Iris,too bad all that SG-1 charm was lost in all the subsequent series
Iris,I'm sure barely anyone would care
Iris,"There was a time where I would check that site daily. They would have such good news for upcoming episodes, great interviews with cast and directors. 

Other then lost, I don’t think I have followed a shows inner and outer workings as much. 

I do believe Stargate still has a future."
Iris,"*Star gate The movie* was basically Bezo’s autobiography, that’s grey skinny bald looking weirdo."
Iris,He said that the Stargate program would have to be public in a new series. That would have given it a whole new take.
Iris,I'm watching SG1 and Atlantis for the 3rd time. They're great on their own but I especially like to have them running in the background when I'm cleaning or working on something.
Iris,"I may or may not have sketched out a new Stargate series over the pandemic if any screenwriters want to take a crack, lol

IMO, the series needs a complete reboot. Earth is just too powerful at the end of the series and what makes it interesting (and different from Star Trek) is exploring the galaxy with our present day technology."
Iris,"There are currently 3 threats posed to humanity, the wraith, the race of cyborg humans from the Deadalus Variations episode of SGA and then there’s the Nakai from SGU.

Earth finds itself defending all human life in the universe from these three races and it would be an excellent parallel to start off a new series with this as it puts humanity in the exact same position the Asgard had been in at the start of SG1.

Facing down a robotic threat that wants to replicate and eradicate all life in the universe. 

Facing a race of creature that breeds humans like livestock and treats them like slaves.

And finally facing an esoteric threat from the Nakai as they are so far advanced to humanity that they can bring people back from the dead with genetic memory still intact just to see how other people react so that they can log that data. They are just so far removed intellectually emotionally from every other race in the universe that they don’t even understand they’re causing harm and it’s likely the lack of emotion that has stopped their progression as a species from Ascending like the ancients did."
Iris,Honestly I feel pretty similarly about actual star trek. It's pretty much impenetrable for new viewers.
Iris,I could see them opening the tech up to the public in an attempt to find someone capable of figuring out how to connect to Destiny and bring everyone on that ship home. They have already dabbled with that by putting the problem Eli Wallace solved into a video game
Iris,"I've been dying for this to happen for years but its time has come and gone, it would make no sense anymore."
Iris,"They waited way too long. The start of SGA was probably the right time to go public.


They are also way too advance. I can't see them making public that they have basically infinite power and could solved world hungry."
Iris,"But at the same time, it would suck to go back to zero and start over.  Not so much a ""the old shows don't count anymore"" but losing that shorthand that's been built up over 17 seasons and a couple movies.

What was your idea?"
Iris,"There’s a comic series that wrap up the destiny storyline, I doubt we’ll ever see it finished in tv. Maybe as an animated show?"
Iris,"Yeah. Being the super power in two galaxies, plus defeating literal gods (Ori) pretty much takes away a lot of the suspense."
Iris,"Clone O'Neill, Cassandra, and Orlin, with the help of their Furling sidekick Glib-Glob, travel through time to prevent Nerus from corrupting the timeline. Stargate: Generations, coming this Fall to the CW."
Iris,"i was surprised it even got a second season, i wish it had a more satisfying end. I liked it enough."
Iris,"Aw man, I know this wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea and I’m not surprised it’s getting canned, but damn I loved this show."
Iris,"This show was a chaotic masterpiece of humans being idiots. :,("
Iris,"Not surprised, but it's a real pity. Few comedies make me laugh beyond a few chuckles, this one gave me gut laughs."
Iris,"Watched Season 1 on a paintball camping weekend with my buddy and we kept looking at each other for the first few episodes every time Hugh Laurie's accent would slip, ever so slightly. 

We couldn't figure it out. He's a much much better actor than that. Like wtf 


Then the reveal. Goddamn we laughed so hard. Bra-vo"
Iris,At least finish the ending!
Iris,"I loved it, but it's very niche. Surprised it got a second season, TBH"
Iris,SECOND SEASON WAS HILLARIOUS. Eeel ivia colman. Cannibal man. Etc. Season two was great great great great great
Iris,#IRIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Iris,"Mother.

Fucker.

(I loved it but I'm surprised it got made at all much less a second season)"
Iris,"not surprised.Shame it didnt hit right considering the talent.

Hope iannucci's next hbo comedy show about the making a superhero hero Franchise film gets made. seemed like an interesting idea."
Iris,We’re not going to find out what happened? I hate that.
Iris,"I hate this news, especially since the end of their seasons are always left at such cliffhangers!! 
This is such a unique show with unique comedy that actually made me laugh out loud regularly, which is hard to find these days."
Iris,"Oh, that sucks!"
Iris,But the food flavorings!
Iris,"Really sad this didn't get the crowd I think it deserved. It's a genuinely funny show with a lot of heart and the Hugh Laurie x Lenora Crichlow pairing was an utter delight. She's been a draw for me since Being Human, always fun to watch.

Rolling a >!convinced pedophile!< around the ship in a giant hamster ball is a scene I'll never forget."
Iris,"Ahh that's a shame, but not unexpected.  I was surprised it got a second season at all.  I saw zero dialogue about the show at work, home, or online - it just seemed to come and go.  I really enjoyed it, but I'm a total sucker for anything Iannucci does.  It was such a trip watching In the Thick Of It and seeing so many of the same faces in Avenue 5.  

Regardless, eagerly looking forward to his next project."
Iris,Tough when the seasons came out so far apart because of the pandemic. Still fun while it lasted.
Iris,They really screwed this with the release structure. One day it just showed up on HBO Max. The only reason I realized was because I wondered what happened to it and did a search. Happened to be the day they dropped it.
Iris,I loved it 😞
Iris,"Man Season 2 was so good. I didn't like season 1, but season 2 had a VEEP quality to it"
Iris,"I really wanted to like this but this show was so disappointing. A new comedy at HBO? From Armando Iannucci? Starring Hugh Laurie and Zach Woods? Sign me up. There's no excuse to be anything less than great.

But I rarely laughed. It was just wasted potential. How do you go from *Veep* to... this?"
Iris,Not shocking: A number of shows that premiered around the time Covid hit got the raw end of the deal.
Iris,"Oh gawd dammit,  is Judd running HBO?! IRIS!!!"
Iris,"I loved the part where all those morons were jumping out of the airlock.

I really wanted to see where it was going. Ah well"
Iris,NOOOOOOOOO
Iris,Noooo! I really liked this show
Iris,At least give it an ending.
Iris,Noooooo
Iris,NooOoOOOoo I loved this how! Judd endorses a third season damnit!
Iris,Great show. This disappoints me. EAT THE RIIIIIIIICH!
Iris,Too bad they didn’t get a third to close it out. I liked it.
Iris,Aw I liked this show although I think Hugh Laurie carried it for me.
Iris,I loved this show.
Iris,"I loved the show, it felt like a spirtual succesor to Red Dwarf. I also haven't come across anybody else who is a fan of it. So I'm not surprised it's getting the axe. 

It ended on a cliffhanger which sucks but is still worth a watch. It had a lot of really funny moments, a lot of which were so crazy that I'd love to hear how the writers came up with them."
Iris,"Second season felt entirely rushed and thrown together.

The first season gave us some great things like the jettison episode and Matt being a spider."
Iris,"Killed by lack of marketing.



A lot of people didn't even know the show existed when the first season came out (to be fair, it was badly timed as the pandemic happened).



It then took far too long to get a second season out (2 years since the first) and then that was woefully undermarketed too."
Iris,I can't believe it got a second season to be honest.
Iris,"Fuck me, I’m watching the second season right now."
Iris,It was a lot like that show on TBS “Wrecked”.
Iris,This was one of those shows that was ALMOST good but it couldn’t seem to quite find its stride.
Iris,Fuck man. I loved this show
Iris,"So they all died up there then, nobody wrote them home. I'm still going to finish the second season."
Iris,"Awww man, rewatched it all recently and loved it. Hope they try and revive it elsewhere"
Iris,This was the funniest fucking show
Iris,That fucking sucks. I loved this show. I knew getting a third season was a long shot but I still had some hope.
Iris,"Awww.  I really enjoyed this ensemble. Funny as heck (the airlock / prank episode!).  
The studio fire, pandemic, and delay in launching season two undoubtedly hurt viewership.

We need more space comedies!"
Iris,Bummer. It was funny and unique.
Iris,i really enjoyed this show. it was kind of like veep in space.
Iris,"God dammit. This was a show that, for me at least, got better with every episode. I was really excited for a season 3"
Iris,"""I love butter. Fuck you."" is one of my favore line-reads in recent years."
Iris,Damn. Loved this show
Iris,boo
Iris,"IRIS!

I'm bummed.  This show was hilarious."
Iris,Sucks that it’s canceled.
Iris,I'm going to hurl myself violently out an airlock.
Iris,"Damn, it wasn’t finished!"
Iris,"Damn, I really wanted that to continue."
Iris,Assholes
Iris,Damn I liked this show
Iris,Doing sci-fi comedy is tough. It rarely gets done well.
Iris,I loved that show and watch a ton of HBO content and didn't even realize it had a second season. Maybe they had a marketing problem?
Iris,"Shame. First season was really subpar, but the second season was better in every way. Still knew it was coming because it just didn't garner an audience. 

Always will look forward to the next Armando Iannucci project."
Iris,So it actually got fucking funny and they cancelled it.  Great.
Iris,"Season 2 definitely seemed cheaper from a production design standpoint and the plot lines were all over the place and felt rushed. 

That being said, I wish it would get a proper ending"
Iris,"I am not surprised, but I did love this show. Definitely not everyone’s cuppa tea"
Iris,Damn I loved it
Iris,"My wife and I binged this and after every episode asked each other, “Why are we watching this shit?” but were looking forward to the next session."
Iris,Shame. Season 2 hit its stride a lot better than the first one. I felt that Armando Iannucci was a little out of his depth trying to get the concept to work early on.
Iris,This had silly humor and erratic story but I could've watched a couple more seasons of this for sure.
Iris,"It had its moments, but overall too frantic with obnoxious characters. The one thing that worked was the crazy social media show with people live tweeting."
Iris," ""This is a safe space, emotionally. Physically, we're obviously in terrible danger."""
Iris,I'm surprised Avenue 5 made it two seasons.
Iris,I liked it because it was different and silly. Sucks it got canceled.
Akame ga Kill!,Death Note
Akame ga Kill!,"Yes, same. Attack on Titan. Very interesting show, and I've watched several other anime series since then."
Akame ga Kill!,This probably dates me but Slayers.
Akame ga Kill!,Trigun.
Akame ga Kill!,Bleach. The moment Kenpachi came on screen I was hooked.
Akame ga Kill!,"Legend of the galactic heroes

The original one. The new reboot doesn’t exist."
Akame ga Kill!,"I guess for me, it would have been Starblazers when I was a kid.

I had no idea what anime was at the time and didn't even realize Starblazers was anime until much later into my adult life.

Starblazers for me was required TV after every day of school  and remember being absolutely devastated when they took it off the air in favor of the Superfrields. I kept my 4PM appointment daily for a very long time in hopes that Starblazers would return, but it never did. I still hold a grudge against Superfriends to this very day.

What really got me into anime as an adult was HxH. My partner at the time (now Husband) was a big anime fan and wanted to introduce me to it. So he picked Hunter and I got hooked. Now I watch anime just as much, if not more, than non-animated TV shows."
Akame ga Kill!,I started both Attack on Titan and Fruits Basket at the same time a few months ago and they are now probably two of my favourite shows of all time
Akame ga Kill!,Death Note
Akame ga Kill!,"Mine was Cowboy Bebop, and it got me absolutely hooked on anime. Still one of my all-time favorite shows."
Akame ga Kill!,"like 10 years ago i rewatched all of Moomins, best anime ever."
Akame ga Kill!,"Tiger Mask back in 1987. Brutal, but awesome"
Akame ga Kill!,"Death Note a few years ago, which I loved. Recently started my second one, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and after I finish that, my third will be Attack on Titan (which will also be my first sub, for the other two I went dub because I heard they're some of the best dubs)."
Akame ga Kill!,"I think the only two I've seen all the way through were *Hellsing Ultimate* and *Monster*. Can't recall which was first. I'm not super into anime, I did watch the first season of *Attack on Titan* at my cousin's recommendation but I didn't continue past that. That one was a little too depressing for my liking lol.

*Monster* was pretty damn fantastic though."
Akame ga Kill!,Witch hunter robin
Akame ga Kill!,"I’ve only ever really dabbled in Anime, but the only one that I’ve seen all the way through is Space Dandy. He’s a dandy guy…in space."
Akame ga Kill!,Youjo Senki
Akame ga Kill!,"First was Attack on Titan, watched the first season in one sitting back when first aired.

Second was Hunter X Hunter i think i binged that show in 3-4 days, was the best anime experience i have ever had."
Akame ga Kill!,"Not me but my fiancée. She recently started watching Sailor Moon again. She watched it as a kid but hadn’t seen the redub from a few years ago so know she’s watching the whole thing start to finish. 

Plus, the final season ever came to the US before the redub because the LGBT community wasn’t exactly looked at in the best light back in the 90s."
Akame ga Kill!,"The Noozles, Maya the Bee, and The Adventures of the Little Koala when I was a kid."
Akame ga Kill!,It’s not finished yet. Still the final part of the final season to come out.
Akame ga Kill!,I still have a fond memory of just staying in bed under the sheets all day binging it lol
Akame ga Kill!,It took me a long time to get through this one because of the sheer number of episodes but this is possibly the best anime I ever watched. Well worth the investment.
Akame ga Kill!,Reboot is good but doesn't hold a candle to the original. The original is proof that deviating from the source material can result in a phenomenal story.
Akame ga Kill!,Greys anatomy. This show has ran so long that all the interesting characters have either died or left. The most recent seasons have been so boring. Everyone is unlikeable now and the writers have now gone to copying formulas from season one because fans have been complaining FOR YEARS that the show has dropped in quality significantly that they are nostalgic for earlier days and would rather watch that than anything new of the show.
Akame ga Kill!,"Greys Anatomy it's a hospital fantasy show that got it's 5th wind because of the pandemic. 

using everyone's misfortune to overstay their welcome a little longer.

I'll help the last episode is they send out for lunch and they all get salmonella and start dropping dead one by one, then all the patients in the hospital get shipped of to a real one with actual doctors to get actual treatment without the drama."
Akame ga Kill!,"I know next season of *Riverdale* will be the last, but it jumped the shark years ago with the whole ""Rivervale"" thing"
Akame ga Kill!, None. If I don’t like a show I stop watching.
Akame ga Kill!,Handmaiden’s Tale
Akame ga Kill!,The Goldbergs.
Akame ga Kill!,The Walking Dead and all its bastard offsprings
Akame ga Kill!,"Simpsons. It's really sad. It's like your uncle that was once the life of the party always cracking hilarious jokes, but now he's just riddled with dementia and shitting himself."
Akame ga Kill!,Riverdale should have ended at season 2
Akame ga Kill!,Jersey Shore.  For some reason I feel compelled to watch it until its cancelled.  They've been arguing over the speech at Angelina's wedding for 3 years.  It is so bad.
Akame ga Kill!,"Star Trek Discovery, just end that abomination."
Akame ga Kill!,"I initially wished that Doctor Who would've ended with Season 10 and ""The Doctor Falls"" for quite a few reasons. One, the episode itself felt like the closest we would ever get to a finale for the show. More importantly, Season 10 and the whole Peter Capaldi era thematically felt like the culmination of everything the show had been building up to. The Doctor finally comes to the understanding that he's not a superhero, not some chosen one. He's just a traveler, someone who tries to help where he can, someone who will always choose kindness. The Doctor also extends this approach to his long time nemesis, The Master, and they finally come to peace with each other. The Doctor goes down fighting for the little guy. 

Building on from that would've been difficult for a showrunner, but Chibnall seemed to go an entirely different direction. The Doctor got a new intricate origin story. Instead of the Doctor being a ordinary traveler who became a legend due to their actions, they were apparently a legend all along. It just felt wrong.

Now though, I'm excited to see what RTD and Ncuti will do with the show again."
Akame ga Kill!,"Cobra Kai was very good this season, but it has to end next season."
Akame ga Kill!,"The Voice. Dancing with the Stars, America's Got Talent, Big Brother, The Amazing Race, Survivor, etc."
Akame ga Kill!,Family Guy and The Simpsons.
Akame ga Kill!,"I tend to want limited series so I’d be ok if none of them continued past a certain point.

Otherwise I’m not sure what show I eat feels concluded.

I will say that I think Squid Game was fine as one season"
Akame ga Kill!,"The Witcher. 

The sooner it ends the sooner we can get a better adaption."
Akame ga Kill!,"There isn't one.

The moment I want a show to end I quit watching it."
Akame ga Kill!,"If Hacks ended right now, I think it would be the perfect two season series."
Akame ga Kill!,"With how stratified the entertainment landscape is, I don't even need to ""want"" a show to end...I just have to have no interest in watching it.

Do not be surprised if shows with small audiences are renewed and others cancelled for seemingly no reason. Streaming is a black box of information on viewership. So, whereas most modern TeeVee makes me physically ill, it's so easy to ignore it.

I don't wish to name drop any shows I dislike, because that just raises awareness. Instead, I will say this: if you, personally, think a show is ""relevant"" or ""representative"" then watch it...but  realize that basing the demographic on smaller niche audiences and ""identity"" is not going to get universal appeal and that as the tiny demo gets smaller, the show is in more danger of being cancelled.

Now, time for me to get excited for the one new show that I have been looking forward to... \[redacted\]."
Akame ga Kill!,"All shows that air for twenty years should be canceled, including reality. I shouldn't have to hear about shows I hate for the rest of my life."
Akame ga Kill!,"This thread is going to be filled with animated shows. Much easier to keep zombified (or should I say reanimated) shows in production when you don’t have to worry about actors becoming older, or more expensive. You can just recast the VA and people will continue to watch so long as it’s a half-decent impression."
Akame ga Kill!,Terry Sliver want to take over the world isn't ridiculous enough for you?
Akame ga Kill!,"The Flash, Fear The Walking Dead, Family Guy, Simpsons, Riverdale"
Akame ga Kill!,Im fine with letting other people watch shows they still like even if I stop watching them. Why end the show? Unless its keeping the characters from being in a different show i guess.
Akame ga Kill!,[deleted]
Akame ga Kill!,"Cobra Kai, time to wrap it up.

The kids are going to college in the show, it's a natural end."
Akame ga Kill!,"The Simpsons.... Family Fucking Guy!!!!!..... American Dad....

Star Trek Discovery!!!! 

Star Trek Picard!!!!

Star Trek SNW's.... 

Star Trek - Lower Drecks!!!!

Doctor Who...."
Akame ga Kill!,"Rings of Power. That show has no right to continue airing considering how bloody awful it is. Needs to be cancelled asap. 

She Hulk. It's yet another pseudo woke travesty in a long line of pseudo woke travesties in the rapid decline that is MCU's post-Endgame downfall."
Akame ga Kill!,"Haha, this is why I like Korean shows that end with one season of 16 or 20 episodes."
Akame ga Kill!,"Honestly, that show jumped the shark at Season 2."
Akame ga Kill!,"Long live Grays Anatomy!   I don't watch it, but it's existence doesn't effect me."
Akame ga Kill!,"Yeah, this is a weird question to me. Why should I care if a show I don't like is still airing? I just don't watch it"
Akame ga Kill!,That show is so bleak I’m surprised it’s still on the air.
Akame ga Kill!,I hated season 4 and I only started season 5 because I have a hard time of letting go of shows but I liked the first 2 episodes. Maybe having the end in sight will help make these last 2 seasons have a clear vision.
Akame ga Kill!,I started rooting for the zombies at that point. 🧟‍♂️
Akame ga Kill!,"> The Walking Dead

It's on the final season 

> all its bastard offsprings

First few seasons of Fear are quality. I also enjoyed the first episode of Tales of the Walking Dead. It was surprisingly good."
Akame ga Kill!,It’s fine. It’s perfectly fine. Is it the glory days of Conan O’Brien’s influence?  No. It’s not that. But it’s not *bad*.  Its just not that impressive compared to what we used to have.
Akame ga Kill!,Simpsons should end while the original cast is still able to do it. Julie Kavner is 72 and Harry Shearer is 78.
Akame ga Kill!,"I was asked this question 20 years ago.

My answer back then was,,,,,The Simpsons."
Akame ga Kill!,Terrific metaphor! 😂
Akame ga Kill!,"I'm not in the camp that wants to see it ""put down"", but I do think it would be nice to see The Simpsons have a series finale. Have that closure."
Akame ga Kill!,It should’ve ended after Season 1.
Akame ga Kill!,"Completely agree. Until RTD comes up with something better, my headcannon is that the doctor refused to regenerate in twice upon a time (the doctor falls is a fine ending too- my favourite every episode in fact- but I actually quite like TUaT)"
Akame ga Kill!,Yep. The Doctor went from someone who became extraordinary overtime to someone who was always extraordinary.
Akame ga Kill!,"Yes, I just want a good series finale as soon as possible."
Akame ga Kill!,Doctor Who ended in 1989.
Akame ga Kill!,"I don't want it to ever end. I feel like it's genuinely an exercise in writing ability to keep the show going. I just want it to take breaks whenever needed to guarantee quality.

I feel like RTD can save it. 

I'm hoping that no one like Chibnal ever gets to touch it again.

What they need is someone like RTD to give the show a direction, and season to season cohesiveness. Then they need good episode writers too. People who write different genres. Doctor who has always been a blend of historical fiction, horror, comedy, science fiction and drama. This is where Moffat shined. Moffat specifically specialized in comedy and fear of the unknown horror to give us the best episodes of the series.

I also think Capaldi was excellent casting, but the writing during his tenure was just awful. Series writing dropped off shortly after RTD left, and though we got some great episodes, the show itself was faltering during all of Moffat's tenure and the last few seasons especially his heart just wasn't in it.

Chibnal's biggest fuck-up was he didn't realize the game that the show is. It's [like improv where there are rules.](https://zapier.com/blog/improv-customer-support/) He ran the show like [Liam Neeson does improv.](https://youtu.be/huJ81Mq2y34)

Don't deny anything from before.

Always keep it fun and entertaining.

Never let it end.

Remember the audience, please the fans.

Feel free to be rediculous."
Akame ga Kill!,"Agreed. I especially hope they bring back forgotten plots and characters, like Tori’s dying mother and criminal aunt as well as Miguel’s father."
Akame ga Kill!,"Hey buddy, don't be cancelling my Survivor"
Akame ga Kill!,Hey I'm too poor to travel I need TAR to fantasize about seeing certain parts of the world!
Akame ga Kill!,Guess you’re not a fan of reality TV. 🤪
Akame ga Kill!,Just dont watch them.
Akame ga Kill!,"The show kinda sucks if we are being honest, but I do sometimes catch myself saying ""toss a coin to ya withcha!"""
Akame ga Kill!,Well said. 👍🏻
Akame ga Kill!,I binged it all in like 2 days that I don't even remember watching it
Akame ga Kill!,🎻
Akame ga Kill!,Him getting arrested for his crimes and the people who beat him also committed crimes yet didn’t get punished for them was ridiculous too.
Akame ga Kill!,The Flash just started filming its final season if I remember right
Akame ga Kill!,">Riverdale

I didn't realize this was still going. I think season 4 was the last I saw, and it became so ridiculously awful I couldn't bear the thought of continuing."
Akame ga Kill!,Agree with all of those! 👍🏻
Akame ga Kill!,I disagree with Family Guy. I feel like it's gotten even better. It needs to keep going. It also needs to stop taking so much time off.
Akame ga Kill!,I guess for some dragging things out for seasons-on-end can sour what was once a great show. I love Succession. I don't want a season 8 of Succession. Just my two cents.
Akame ga Kill!,Because maybe you like a show that's going down hill and don't want to play mental gymnastics with your head-canon about where the story actually ends.
Akame ga Kill!,"I’ve heard mixed opinions about it. Is it really that bad? If so, why?"
Akame ga Kill!,"Agreed! “Cobra Kai never dies”, until it gets so boring and repetitive that it’ll contradict itself by begging for a mercy killing."
Akame ga Kill!,I’m enjoying rings of power. Haven’t watched she hulk yet but I will. People complaining something is “woke” makes me want to watch it more since I usually disagree with almost everything those people believe.
Akame ga Kill!,Can't jump the shark if you never come back down.
Akame ga Kill!,"Yep. I marvel that it's still going. But I'm happy it's fans and cast still have it, even though I stopped watching 10 years ago.

The only shows I want to end are ones I like but fear will get cancelled before getting to end on their own terms. It's why I'm happy Kevin Can F\*\*\* Himself got a second and final season upfront."
Akame ga Kill!,"This maybe was relevant when broadcast TV was king. NBC had their their comedies, if one was bad you wanted it to end so a new one could take its place on Thursday night. 

Now with streaming it doesn't matter that I don't care about Chicago PD or whatever, I just don't watch it.

Though some people might want a show to get a proper ending now rather than die a slow death."
Akame ga Kill!,Yet so many people online spend years bashing shows they hate. I’ve seen social media accounts that the only thing they post is bashing shows and hoping they get canceled (and even making up that they have been)
Akame ga Kill!,Fear the walking dead was great for the first few seasons.   Still doesn't beat Z Nation though - that just got crazier as it went on.
Akame ga Kill!,Please don't bring back Miguel's father. That guy can not act for the lif3 of him. He acts like he just walked off the set of Metastasis
Akame ga Kill!,"There are some shows that I enjoy, these that I listed, not so much."
Akame ga Kill!,And not leave those slots open to new shows being imagined and created? I think not..
Akame ga Kill!,you could just not watch a season 8 of Succession.
Rurouni Kenshin,Next I bet we will get a new season of The Slayers lol
Rurouni Kenshin,"If this adapted the whole storyline, and without filler it would be great."
Rurouni Kenshin,Nice
Rurouni Kenshin,"Not a fan of the animation, the character drawing looks too clean, so much so it's giving me 2016 Berserk vibes."
Rurouni Kenshin,inb4 everyone hating on this because the author is a piece of shit.
Rurouni Kenshin,"Oh man, I’m excited to revisit this classic in a newer-looking form."
Rurouni Kenshin,"Animation looks cheap, especially if these are highlights they are choosing for the trailer. 

Nothing will ever top the Trust and Betrayal movies though. Wouldn’t mind a movie per arc of that quality. 

The recent live actions have actually been pretty good."
Rurouni Kenshin,Surprised this is happening with the recent news of the Author
Rurouni Kenshin,"I loved this manga, so well done... but man fuck that author."
Rurouni Kenshin,That you are 😊
Rurouni Kenshin,Wish I could feel excited for this.
Rurouni Kenshin,"This is unexpected but really a great news. One of the best shonen and one which doesn't have an annoying MC who want to be the best, the king, the strongest or any of this shonen dream-trop"
Rurouni Kenshin,"Hope it isn’t as preachy as the previous versions. I want to see good sword fight, not a ten minute speech about the heart of a warrior or the sword protects peace or some bs.

""When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk."" -Tuco"
Rurouni Kenshin,Why did they not bring back Mayo Suzukaze to voice Kenshin? Weak sauce. And this trailer looks cheap as hell.
Rurouni Kenshin,I just want Sony to adapt the dub. Bring chaos to the world.
Rurouni Kenshin,that would actually be incredible!
Rurouni Kenshin,"Full reboot based on the novels, at least."
Rurouni Kenshin,We are getting a reboot of Urusei Yatsura next month (it ended in the 80d while slayers was in the 90s)
Rurouni Kenshin,I honestly usually don't care about the animations that much but 2021 and 2022 have really spoiled me with how good some animes can look and i do not like this trailer one bit. It feels very cheap.
Rurouni Kenshin,WOW. I had no clue. God damnit.
Rurouni Kenshin,I can bypass and separate the work of JK Rowling and Harry Potter but I have an harder time with Kenshin and that piece of shiet
Rurouni Kenshin,"Fun fact, he has so much CP(Real shit, not the ""grey area"" drawn content), that they thought he was distributing it.

Turns out he was not and had bought this shit when it was legal. When Japan somehow made it illegal, he ""forgot"" to turn it in to be disposed of, so the Feds going off of records, raided him and fined him about $1,500 


His punishment was to have his Manga(Kenshin Hokkaido arc) on hiatus a few months. He wasn't canned, because he's a big cash cow and Kenshin is still incredibly popular. 


Japan's laws against sex crimes are awful."
Rurouni Kenshin,"I own the full collection of the manga (before knowing the author was a pedophile), and I have to say it's just OKAY. There's nothing remarkable about the series. Even the iconic character designs are all lifted from characters in other media (Watsuki himself admits to stealing a lot of Marvel character designs)."
Rurouni Kenshin,I loved it as a kid but couldn't get past some of the like uwu scenes. Hoping this will address that
Rurouni Kenshin,The fact that Studio Deen did Trust and Betrayal is always hilarious to me.
Rurouni Kenshin,"What recent news?

I know he got arrested for child porn, but wasn’t that years ago?"
Rurouni Kenshin,"Same. I love redemption and atonement stories. Kenshin was the series that started my love of these stories even, but damn, I just can’t bring myself to support the author. Guy wasn’t even ashamed of what he did and almost 100% still buys child porn."
Rurouni Kenshin,"Reading through ""The Slayers: Special"" right now and would love a series that is closer to the books than the OVAs."
Rurouni Kenshin,"This is a month old but I'm still shocked how easy he got away with possession of Child Porn. It's disgusting and that just highlights what's wrong with  Japanese laws. The fact that CP was legal at one point not that long ago in Japan is also very disturbing.

 I know people will say you can separate the content from the author but it's hard not to think about it when I see clips of Kenshin. At the back of my mind I always remember how the creator is a pedophile and  knowing that fact makes it hard for me to get hyped about this."
Rurouni Kenshin,The comedy is integral to the themes of the show in the earlier seasons.
Rurouni Kenshin,"I’ve lost track of the studios at this point, you’re gonna have to remind me why it’s hilarious."
Rurouni Kenshin,You are right. I thought that happened this year for some reason
Rurouni Kenshin,"They did the original fate/stay night. Also did Samurai Deeper Kyo, which is basically a powerpoint presentation/slide show."
Rurouni Kenshin,Ah. Just looked it up and they did Sword of the Stranger as well. Got some real stand-out animation movies and some really horribly animated TV shows.
Rurouni Kenshin,Sword of the stranger was animated by bones not deen
Rurouni Kenshin,Didn't even know they did that. Such a confusing company.
Rurouni Kenshin,"Sorry, you’re right, I just searched Studio Deen and Sword of the Stranger showed up. Apparently they did the [in-between animation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1121794/companycredits?ref_=tt_dt_co)."

Rurouni Kenshin,"[Saint Seiya Hades Sanctuary Arc](https://youtu.be/GotGFk-0-O4), this song is beautiful"
Rurouni Kenshin,FMAB op 4 also has the best ending song. It completely hyped u up for the next episode. Great job by the studio
Rurouni Kenshin,"Pilot Candidate has one of my favorite opening themes of all time.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CuNToaNBb1s"
Rurouni Kenshin,Elfen Lied. Such a beautiful piece of music.
Rurouni Kenshin, Kaze wo Sagashite -One Piece
Rurouni Kenshin,"[Toradora Opening 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Xmzu0OtS8). So damn good.

Also you listed 3 Bleach openings but somehow missed [the best one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92TEcszkRBw). C'mon, man!"
Rurouni Kenshin,"I agree with those, though I like [Eureka 7 OP3](https://youtu.be/Tg7EQpMMUq0) best!"
Rurouni Kenshin,"I like Death Note 02.  I think it's sassy, and the Ryuk-with-apple shot slaps."
Rurouni Kenshin,Paranoia agent is definitely up there. The music plus the laughter just gives off this weird vibe that helps set the tone.
Rurouni Kenshin,"I ended up being disappointed in Paranoia Agent (the jealous kid episode excepted; that was brilliant) after previously loving Satoshi Kon's films, but it has the best opening of any TV show ever possibly."
Rurouni Kenshin,And the season one intro for spice and wolf
Rurouni Kenshin,i meant fma brotherhood op 4 like i said.
Rurouni Kenshin,so they reused an op from the original series in the newer show?
Rurouni Kenshin,oh shit you're right. this is from the og not brotherhood my bad. 😅
Rurouni Kenshin,How'd you forget static shock? 
Rurouni Kenshin,"Since the majority of reddit are probably the ages that grew up with these shows (like me) People are going say yes because of nostalgia.

I'm sure when the current kids are grown up, they will be posting reddit posts ""The thundermans and Stuck in the middle"" were the best kids sitcoms.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;"
Rurouni Kenshin,"The lack of Superman: TAS, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, KaBlam!, and The Angry Beavers is very upsetting."
Rurouni Kenshin,"These are just things we grew up with and enjoyed. There have been plenty of fantastic shows for kids over the last 15 years. There's also been garbage, and there was also plenty of garbage back then. "
Rurouni Kenshin,Bobby's World? Ran for seven seasons on Fox Kids. 
Rurouni Kenshin,"As a child of the 80’s I’m biased. Transformers, GI JOE, MASK, Ghostbusters, He-Man, TMNT, Ducktales, Thundercats, Voltron, and a ton of other shows if I did 10 min of research. "
Rurouni Kenshin,Indeed. Was lucky enough to have access in Australia to some of these shows.
Rurouni Kenshin,"I might extend it a few years to include Avatar: The Last Air Bender, the original Ben 10, and Naruto. 

Outside of that, kid cartoons haven't been entertaining me or popular for kids. I know I'm not a kid, but I'd want shows that I could sit back and at least be entertained by if I am with some younger cousins that they actually know. "
Rurouni Kenshin,"Yeah, you guys certainly lucked out. When I was growing up Disney cartoons were basically ""you like ducks? Here's some ducks. Did you like those ducks? Here's some other ducks."" Non-Disney stuff was just long toy commercials or mind-fucks like Heathcliff."
Rurouni Kenshin,"X-Men, Spider-Man, and Batman TAS, all at the same time?

Kids will never have it that good again. What song today could ever reach the quality of the X-men intro?"
Rurouni Kenshin,"Yes it was. Well, in actuality the Golden Age is 1991 - 2003.

There are always going to be outliers that make people assume the real dates are some amalgamation of a 20-something year period but I argue those 12 years were the true golden age because it was a constant influx of quality that was bookended by important events. The forming of Cartoon Network to air the cartoons from the original golden age and Nickelodeon airing their first NickToon; all the way until the corporate crash and burn of the early-to-mid 2000s.

---
Nickelodeon under Warner had been an exclusively kids television channel since 1979; [let's just say it hadn't quite figured things out just yet.] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Nicklogoiozzi79.jpg) They were operating at loss with shows they now pretend don't exist anymore. They hired the guys who made MTV iconic to spruce up the Network, [which they accomplished exceptionally well] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAIX96v1mI) and in 1986 they were sold to Viacom. Under Viacom, Nickelodeon began their rise, first with the original Kid's Choice Awards and then by airing Nick Jr. during school hours. In 1990 they opened the Nickelodeon Studios where they filmed their early sitcoms and game shows and in 1991 Nicktoons began.

Meanwhile, in 1991, Ted Turner bought Hanna-Barbera and created Cartoon Network. The purpose being to air the tape library he had acquired over the years. Along with Hanna-Barbera, he also owned the MGM cartoon library, the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts, as well as Popeye.

There was now true competition in the world of kids-exclusive television. Money was being pumped into it and most importantly creators were given the freedom to experiment and tell good/great stories and be silly within of course the guidelines of Standards and Practices. John Kricfalusi would discover this the hard way when his popular masterpiece 'Ren and Stimpy' was cancelled for going too far.

Eight years of near perfection. 

Then within a two year period two cataclysmic events happened. Firstly, in 1999 Spongebob Squarepants happened and it was the most popular cartoon ever made and its merchandise alone became omnipresent. Nickelodeon became oddly complacent and out of touch after this. In 2005 Viacom split into two companies marking a definitive end and you can see it in their release line-up.

The second big cataclysmic event was that in 2001, Turner merged with AOL to become AOL TimeWarner which many consider to be the greatest financial blunder in history. Jamie Kellner headed the company and while it seemed reasonable at the time given he was the guy that made Fox a legitimate fourth network and made WB the who's who of cult classic television. However in 2001, Kellner cancelled everything from WCW to Animaniacs to Batman: TAS in favor of shows he wanted to see. Again, this is the guy who is responsible for The Simpsons, Beverly Hills 90210, Married... with Children, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Charmed and the NFL being on Fox, maybe he knew what he was doing.

In 2003, the AOL TimeWarner experiment had officially crashed and burned. TimeWarner dropped AOL from their name and everything was swept under the carpet. They say that without Turner and his stubbornness (and his finance department working the books) many of his crazy, money losing ideas would have been done away with quickly. Once he was out of the company, that ended up being true. WCW was cancelled immediately. CNN was always sensational but with him gone, [well... yeah] (https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/). Cartoon Network meanwhile... it was never the same and eventually even started airing non-cartoons.

---
In June 2018, AT&T bought out TimeWarner. As of ~~three~~ two days ago, Turner doesn't even exist.

> On March 4, 2019, AT&T began restructuring WarnerMedia. HBO, TNT, TBS and TruTV were combined into a new entity, WarnerMedia Entertainment.

> WarnerMedia's Otter Media and Turner's Turner Classic Movies, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and Boomerang became part of Warner Bros. 

> CNN, HLN, Turner Sports, Bleacher Report and AT&T Regional Sports Networks were consolidated under newly-formed WarnerMedia News & Sports.

There will never be another golden age."
Rurouni Kenshin,"I dunno. I guess I'm kind of biased being born near the end of that era, but the 2010s had some really good stuff as well, if not, even better. Of course, this is opinion, and you're free to disagree, but we've had:

Adventure Time

Steven Universe

Star Vs the Forces of Evil

Gravity Falls

Over the Garden Wall

Star Wars: The Clone Wars

The Amazing World of Gumball

Not even to mention the adult cartoons Rick and Morty, and Bojack Horseman.

Sure, there is probably less quantity overall, so you could definitely argue against this era, but quite a lot of these shows are just as good, if not even better than a lot of the shows that you listed.

Again, just my opinion."
Rurouni Kenshin,"You're wrong, it was (insert decade when I was a kid)."
Rurouni Kenshin,I downloaded them and my kids love whatever I show em
Black Sails,"It's been said a couple times but season 1 is a bit rough IMO. It is one of those shows that you're not too sure what is going and they compensate with uber violence and nudity. I'm not against that kind of jazz, it just is almost a calling card of low budget/one seasons shows. I would still say it'd be a 7 with seasons 2+ being 9s. I'm just a regular folk who likes tropical settings and pirates, so take it as that.

Seasons 2 + is some of my favorite TV show watching ever. They really got into their groove. Incredible personalities, tons of onscreen chemistry between characters that you get from working together for some time, enough twists and turns and even a solid ending. It is one of the few shows that I've ever actually said out loud with no one else around ""Oh they should not have done that"".

Very glad I stuck with the show.

\*Remember fruit is fruit."
Black Sails,Yes.  It takes a few episodes IIRC for the plot to reveal a little more.
Black Sails,"I remember watching the first couple episodes (can't remember how many) and thought it's bad and I should not continue.

I did continue and it turned into an absolute brilliant show after a very weak beginning, at least for me."
Black Sails,"Season 1 is good, seasons 2-4 are damn near perfect tv. Season two’s season finale is probably my all time favorite episode of tv ever."
Black Sails,"First season is good, but you can tell they were confined by a budget for an unproven commodity. Season 2 when they were able to get onto the ocean more was just awesome"
Black Sails,Black Sails is one of very few i rated 10/10.
Black Sails,"It’s so damn good, it starts out kind of slow with world building but seasons 2 and 3 are some of my personal favorite seasons of television. Excellent acting performances from Toby Stevens and Luke Arnold."
Black Sails,It is a perfect show. It would’ve been a Top 5 show of all time if it was on HBO.
Black Sails,"Black Sails is great!  Like others have said, it takes a bit to get rolling, but I was hooked from the first episode.  There's a mix of history loosely based in fact, a bit of legend, and a lot borrowed from Treasure Island.  

Most of the key characters are at least somewhat true to their backstories, be they historically accurate or based on their exaggerated exploits.

Keep Wikipedia open and check out some of the main character's entries.  

All that said, I was so happy when they introduced Rackham.  The only pirate to ever sail with a female first mate (Anne Bonny).  I've got a Rackham styled Jolly Roger because I thought he was one of the more interesting figures from the age of piracy.  You'll probably recognize it as one of the more common Roger's.  Oddly enough, you don't see a lot of iterations of Blackbeard's flag, even though he was one of the more feared pirates, and one with a much juicier legend."
Black Sails,"Black Sails, Spartacus, and Turn are all insane shows not enough people have watched"
Black Sails,One of my favorites of all time and I've seen most of the great ones.
Black Sails,It's one of the all time greats. This reminded me I need to do a rewatch! Also one of the greatest opening themes of all time.
Black Sails,"Yes. It ties up nicely to treasure Island and also have a satisfying ending. Probably the best pirate show around, not that there are many."
Black Sails,"Such an unexpected Gem. I started season 2, and have actually never gone back through season 1, I heard it was a bit rough as the show took a moment to find it's footing, but 2+ is just a fun, dramatic, memorable ride - especially if you're already familiar withTreasure Island. And it ends so beautifully"
Black Sails,Such a great show
Black Sails,It's a fantastic show that constantly improves. One of my all time favorites.
Black Sails,"great show

just know they spent all the budget on building the sets and ships (which are great) and costumes so all the action is in the first and last episode of season 1, but season 2 onwards a lot more happens because the budget goes further."
Black Sails,I’d put it on just for the opening credit alone
Black Sails,One of the very best
Black Sails,Absolutely!! I miss it so much. Had so much fun watching it back in 2014/2015 :(
Black Sails,"A very good show, up there with the best"
Black Sails,"It's great. Violent and compelling with some great acting sprinkled in.

Also, I know a girl who likes to recite drunken impassioned Captain Flint speeches and it's incredibly hot."
Black Sails,"Fuck yes.

Also I never skip the intro."
Black Sails,"It's one of my all-time faves. It starts slow, but picks up after 4 episodes or so."
Black Sails,"I liked it, and it has a sick intro."
Black Sails,"I tried 3 times to watch it and I don't think I got past episode 5 or 6 at the most.

It just doesn't look and feel right. It feels like a soap.

The actors are too beautiful, everyone looks perfect. Nothing like how pirates and pirate life was in real life.

It's a soap opera for people who want to watch perfect looking people in an easy to digest format.

If you're looking for a gritty, true-to-life depiction of pirates this ain't it."
Black Sails,Yes.
Black Sails,It's amazing. On par with stuff like Mad Men and ^((early))  Game of Thrones
Black Sails,It's very good imo but it might take a few episodes to get going.
Black Sails,Season 1 is slow but the pay off is worth it. Seasons 2-4 are some of the best I’ve ever seen in television
Black Sails,It is good. Give it a whirl.
Black Sails,Yep.
Black Sails,"Season 1- string character building , so push room.  It becomes epic !! Rewatched 3 times already."
Black Sails,Yes. The first episode is great. The next few episodes are slow and tedious but important for the overall plot. After those few episodes it picks back up and never stops being great.
Black Sails,Unbelievably fantastic
Black Sails,It's an HBO tier show on Starz. Really fantastic show all around except for maybe the very start.
Black Sails,"Im in the same boat OP, heard great things but couldn't make it through the first episode before tapping out."
Black Sails,"Nah, its a great show. Starts a little slow, disjointed, but man... its fucking phenomal."
Black Sails,"It’s one of my favourite Tv series’ of all time, so yes."
Black Sails,"One of my all time favorites, it’s especially good if you like pirate history and treasure island"
Black Sails,"It's a great show. It does start slow, but season 2 is straight fire from beginning to end. 3 and 4 are very good too."
Black Sails,"To echo what others have said, S1 takes a while to get going. On my first watch, I struggled with the first 3-4 eps and gave up. When I returned to it, the first season does improve in the back half. But S2 and 3 have a noticeable jump in quality and the story really gets going. I found S4 to not be as good as the previous 2 seasons, but it was still a satisfying conclusion."
Black Sails,"One of my favorite shows, so so good."
Black Sails,Yes
Black Sails,"Good? No.

It's phenomenal."
Black Sails,Imagine GoT with pirates instead of dragons and with an amazing final season. That's Black Sails.
Black Sails,We loved it.
Black Sails,It’s great. There are scenes that have stayed with me years and years later which to me is the biggest test.
Black Sails,"One of the best ever made 

We dont see that too often recently, we are bombarded by poor quality shows with jacked reviews from probably fake people or bots.

Black sails is the real deal"
Black Sails,"Phenomenal. But the first season is easily the weakest. In fact, each season is better than the previous one. What I’m saying is, keep going if you don’t like the initial episodes."
Black Sails,"It has some really great moments, as well as meh moments. But there is not a whole lot like it around, definitely worth a watch. Great intro!"
Black Sails,It is incredible
Black Sails,At least for myself I thought it was a show which consistently improved over time.
Black Sails,"It's a fantastic show, definitely worth watching."
Black Sails,the first season is definitely the weakest but it ends strongly and only goes up from there. One of my favorite shows of all time.
Black Sails,"OP as everyone says, just struggle through the first few episodes. I watched Black Sails when it came out and I was almost not gonna go back after the first season but my oh my was I glad I did. The mark up in quality is massive after Season 1, 2-4 is sublime television,  great characters great visuals for the budget they had too. Immense show and among my top 5 of all time!"
Black Sails,"Yeah its sick. Just watch it. The show ends nicely too. It really picks up in drama at the end of the 2nd season. 

Also the way they use the budget is incredible. The show stars no famous stars and the visuals and production value punch above their weight."
Black Sails,"If you have thick enough skin to get through the first few dreadful episodes, it’s a wonderfully entertaining series."
Black Sails,"Its very popular, but it was a weird mixed bag for me. 

The performances are excellent and the characters are interesting. The story, however, takes very long to get anywhere and the pacing moves in fits and starts. I’d still watch it just for the performances, though."
Black Sails,I’ve just finished season 2 and I’m enjoying it. There are a few things I don’t like about it but overall it’s worth your time.
Black Sails,It's fantastic. Give it 3 episodes at least. It takes a minute to develop but it's great.
Black Sails,One of my favorites. Hang in there.
Black Sails,Oh ya that show was awesome
Black Sails,We binged it thru the pandemic lockdown. It was incredible.
Black Sails,If Black Beard in episode 1 didn't get your attention then nothing will.
Black Sails,"I love seeing this show get its flowers. For so long, it’s felt like my wife and I were the only ones who watched it."
Black Sails,"Fantastic show. It can feel like a slow start for a lot of people (I love it), because season one focuses on a lot of world and character building ahead of adventure.

It's a show that got its desired run and ended on its own terms as well."
Black Sails,"I liked parts of it and some of the characters.  I'm a fan of pirates though.

The opening title sequence is really badass.  Of course, that's what you can expect from Bear McCreary.

It aired on Starz, so it's pretty gritty, so it's got that going for it."
Black Sails,Yep yep yep.
Black Sails,"Ahoy hoy, many many pirate hooker boobs are to be found here matey"
Black Sails,So so so so so SO good. Check it out!!!
Black Sails,"Yes. It's one of my favourite shows. The characters are great and the action is awesome. It's a fully complete story with only 4 seasons. 

The first season is a bit slow paced since it's just taking it's time to build the setting. I think that's what most people complain about though I enjoyed the first season. 

Just keep going. I think most people loved season 2 onwards even if they didn't like slower pacing in season 1."
Black Sails,On top with spartacus
Black Sails,"Yes, I loved that one."
Black Sails,"Yes, best live action pirate series out there. I remember when I first watched it, I couldn’t help but compare it to GoT quality wise."
Black Sails,"Yes, I strongly recommend it!"
Black Sails,"I think it's one of the best shows of the last decade. I 's a show that ends, one where the creators thought about teh ending and make it mean something. After the ending you can pick up the book and read it and even enjoy it more!"
Black Sails,A lot of gratuitous sex in the first season but picks up into a real fun show
Black Sails,Best complete normal tv show I’ve ever watched
Black Sails,One of the season finales (I think season 3) is still one of my favorite episodes of TV ever.
Black Sails,"Along with Rome it's on my top 2 TV shows ever.

Season 4, episode 3 included one of the most upsetting scenes I've ever experienced.

Its pacing and revelation was absolutely magnificent."
Black Sails,"It is a great show!  
If you love pirates there is nothing that compares to it."
Black Sails,Yes it’s great
Black Sails,"Get through season one. 

The rest of the show is incredible."
Black Sails,It's great. Probably the best pirate themed content of the last decades.
Black Sails,"Amazing show, especially after the first couple of episodes."
Black Sails,"if the show was on the air now, it would have critical acclaim....if you know how it ends you know why."
Black Sails,"Yes, a very good one!!. Unexpected twists."
Black Sails,"Great show. Finished it last year. The ending for a major character story arc is not quite what you’d expect but it’s very satisfying in context of the show and makes a ton of sense looking backwards. 

As others have said season 2 and on are amazing. Captain Flynn is a great character. The actor does really well with him and makes him very memorable."
Black Sails,It’s one of the few shows that actually keeps getting better as it goes on.
Black Sails,I really loved it.
Black Sails,"I just recently started watching the show and I enjoyed the pilot but found the next 3-4 episodes to be slow. Not bad, just slow. A lot of talking and not a lot of pirate stuff.

The end of S1 picks up and S2 (especially the end of S2) was really fun to watch and I'm fully invested now. I recommend it."
Black Sails,"It’s my all time favorite show and a masterpiece.

I actually don’t think the first season is as bad as everyone is saying it is. And it sets up basically everything that comes later. Some parts, like the Eleanor intro, are cringe, and some storylines are forgotten later because they weren’t good, but you have to really internalize every single thing the characters say because 90% of it is critical to the overall themes and arcs of the show.

Especially listen to every single word that comes out of Flint’s mouth. But really rewatching the first season will blow your mind with how much of it went completely over your head."
Black Sails,"It has some interesting characters in the first season that they never fleshed out to my satisfaction, and instead stuck with the brooding Captain Flint whose sexual orientation they flip in season 2. The show is mostly boring."
Black Sails,"God-tier show. Criminally underrated. One of the best and most satisfying endings of all time, especially if you're familiar with Treasure Island."
Black Sails,"Definitely worth the watch. It never got the hype it deserved because

1) It aired on Starz, which doesnt have nearly as many subscribers as other networks.

2) It aired in the same years as GoT which was getting all the attention."
Black Sails,"Mixed. I watched it a while ago, and some of it is cool and interesting while a lot of it just drags out forever and is clearly filler. There's definitely good parts in there, but it's not a masterpiece by far."
Black Sails,"Fine I’ll say it, boobs!"
Black Sails,YESSS. I a 30 year old man cry every time I watch the last episode. FUCKING WATCH IT.
Black Sails,"It genuinely had no right being that good.  A lot of people say Season 1 is pretty bad, I personally think it's not as bad as people think but it's definitely the worst one. After that the show gets better with each seasons.  
  
I think Season 1 is pretty mediocre because they really tried to copy Spartacus/Got in term of sex and nudity, after that they did their own thing and it got much better.  
  
Keep at it, the characters are great, the action is good, the plot is very good, and Toby Stephens is really really good in this.  
  
I think this was one of the most overlooked show in recent years, I don't want to say underrated because most people who've seen the show agree that it's really good (personally think it's way better than Spartacus) but it seems a lot of people aren't even aware this show exist."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","They’re all good and so is Future Boy Conan. It all moves so fast and is zippy and fun, you get caught up in it. I’d recommend watching this show to anyone."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Who here is a fan of Eizoken? ;)
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Question for Miyazaki-philes. I've seen Nausicaa, Spirited Away, and Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, and My Neighbor Totoro.

Are any of his other films as good? Or did I pick the cream of the crop?"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Anyone Arabic here would know just how essential this anime is lol

Our parents grew up with it, we grew up with it, everyone grew up with it"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",r/oldotaku
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Future Boy Conan is great. Watched it on TV for months way before I knew of the rest of Miyazaki's work.

It's about a boy who has always lived in an island with his uncle since the world ""ended"". When said uncle dies, he sets out to find other people, and what he experiences is nothing short of amazing."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I want Conan O’Brien to do voice work for this show!
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Dude!! I used to watch this way way back! Awesome
"Conan, The Boy in Future","My actual favorite TV anime.

If you like The Wind Waker, you will LOVE this series. Many scenes and moments from that game is ripped straight from Future Boy Conan."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I don’t understand why that girl has a giant dump truck ass, is that part of the story?"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Too bad anime fans won't watch it and instead watch whatever garbage isekai or ecchi that panders to them
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Watched this a few years ago when I found out all the episodes were on YouTube (they’re not anymore) and it’s soooo good. Even rewatched it about a year ago with my partner and she loved it too. If you like Ghibli movies you’ve got to check it out! Curious about how the English dub will be.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I remember watching that show in french I loved it
"Conan, The Boy in Future","this brings me back, what a beautiful anime. Still remember the scene when they make them peel a literal mountain of potatoes"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Kiki's Delivery Service and Porco Rosso are also excellent. Also if like Studio Ghibli in general, get Grave of the Fireflies."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",would highly recommend lupin the third - castle of cagliostro
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I would say they're all good, but you saw the essentials. You missed Castle in the Sky, that's one of the best IMO. And I think Porco Rosso is excellent but a little niche maybe"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Porco Rosso is his best work IMO!
"Conan, The Boy in Future","You need to watch Laputa, Castle in the Sky. It’s my favorite of his films."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I cannot say I love ALL of Ghibli movies, but all of them give me a warm feeling inside my heart. When I first tried to watch Only Yesterday I stopped halfway through because I was bored out of my mind. On a second attempt it became one of my very special movies (just don't skip the closing credits).

Whisper of the Heart is a great choice."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","It's a very different film from what he normally creates, but The Wind Rises was just as gorgeous and compelling as anything he's made. Secret life of arriety is worth a watch at some point, too"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Porco Rosso is a really fun film that tends to get overlooked. It's by far the funniest of all his films. It left me howling when I saw it for the first time at Ghibli fest.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Definitely watch The Wind Rises. Not as fantastical as the other movies listed there but it’s still a beautiful drama with plenty of Miyazaki’s best traits.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Ponyo is my fave of his. The vibes are immaculate.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","He's one of the few directors where all of his films are, at the very least, really good. I highly recommend watching all his stuff."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I'd recommend spirited away because it's a beautiful film with an amazing score.

Grave of the fireflies is a somber sad look at the effects of war.  Great for one viewing."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Ponyo is probably my absolute favourite.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",All 11 of Miyazaki’s films are 100% worth watching IMO. Ponyo is the only that I don’t LOVE but it’s still worth watching.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Uh..  Ponyo is major essential viewing. So is The Cat Returns.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I really enjoy Ocean Waves and The Wind Rises
"Conan, The Boy in Future","It depends on your age, and how you relate to each film, but my absolute fave is ONLY YESTERDAY.  It conjures feelings of how our adult and childhood selves are both the same person, and also hopelessly out of reach from eachother.  Beautiful film."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Porco Rosso is legit great. It’s a love letter to flight from a guy that just loves flight. It’s a little more zany than other Ghibli fare but some real emotional beats there too. 

P.S. Disney/Pixar made a love letter to Miyazaki in making Luca. It’s a very Miyazaki style film with some almost direct references. Massimo is almost lifted straight out of films like Castle in the sky and Kiki’s, for example. The town is called Porto Rosso, etc."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I think he worked on the Anne of Green Gables anime. Maybe give that a shot.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","All of them are great. In older age I’ve loved Porco Rosso more than ever. Kiki and Ponyo are great. Castle in the Sky is essential Miyazaki and has an amazing soundtrack. 

But yeah, watch them all if you like what you’ve seen so far."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Castle in the Sky and Kiki’s Delivery Service are both great! The latter is actually one of my favorite Miyazaki movies.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",The Wind Rises is outstanding. It’s more of a straight drama with very light sprinkles of whimsy and fantasy. It’s important to go in with this expectation as it’s a biopic drama than a fantasy like the other films you’ve already seen.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","If you want something a bit more modern and outside studio ghibli i recommend makoto shinkais work too.

The girl who leapt through time, a boy and his beast, mirai... etc"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","They're all good, although not as thematically complex as those."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Don’t be afraid to venture out to non-Miyazaki works. I liked Princess Kaguya’s art style quite a lot.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Just a note to anyone going into GotF blind (which you should do, as little spoilers as possible):

It is a great film, but you will not have a good time watching it.   Doubly so if you go in expecting something along the lines of Spirited Away or Totoro.  I'd still absolutely recommend it, but buy some tissues and maybe call a family member and tell them you love them first."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Will shamelessly say that Proco Rosso might just be my favorite Miyazaki movie.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Kiki erasure.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Accurate. Didn't really like Kiki  because it just kind of ends.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I really feel like that one's a bit dated? I mean all of the older men flirting with a 17 year old doesn't sit right me. I mean I still enjoy it and I've seen it a few times, but I think my last watch will be my last. Although I am a bit curious as to why you'd choose it as your favourite?

I dunno, I just feel like there's so many others I'd have chosen above Porco Rosso."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Will do. Thanks.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Only Yesterday's got my favorite ending in the Ghibli canon.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I really enjoyed that one. It's very SoL but that doesn't mean it's not good.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Yeah I saw Spirited Away.. did i forget to include that?

I initially didn't wanna see it because the thumbnail of the witch's extremely huge distorted head was unpleasant. But you can't judge a book by its cover."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Ponyo is… weird. It’s truly a kid’s story. I couldn’t appreciate it until I had my own kid, who loved it on his own terms. (He especially loved the instant noodles with ham scene, and asks my wife to make it now and then.)"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Ponyo is fantastic! Especially if you’re stoned
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Are those Miyazaki or his son Goro?
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Damn, you're the first person ever who I saw that liked Ocean Waves. 

It's my most watched Ghibli film (well it was a TV special so it's a quick watch) followed by My neighbor Totoro. I'd rate Spirited Away and Mononoke- hime higher though"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Only as a small role during production tho ,not as a director. Isao Takahata is the OG when it comes to classic TV series of that period.

Anne is incredible."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I'm not afraid. I just don't want the 'usual' anime stuff with the tropes
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Dude i watched this shit with my wife after she showed me spirited away and it fuckin got me good. I had mentioned liking totoro when growing up and she liked spirited away so we picked a random one and it happened to be GotF and ohhh boy I wasn't ready. Lol
"Conan, The Boy in Future",How many tissues? Are we talking  intro to _Up_ level? Or more?!
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Every time I see a variation of this comment, it makes me feel like a sociopath for not crying during this movie. It was a sad film, sure, but so are most films that tackle the realities of war. 

Maybe I’m just fucked up"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Kiki is one of the greats and Ponyo for the music.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",tbh its a meandering movie but its good vibes all the way
"Conan, The Boy in Future",That's my issue with it too. All that build-up for.....what?
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I feel like quite a few Ghibli movies are like that.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Bad ass dog fights with sick jazz music. Also weird thing to focus on, but we got a bad ass 17 year old mechanic working her ass off to fix planes despite it being a male dominated field especially given the context of the setting like aren’t they in war time with nazis if I remember correctly? And since the dude listed a bunch of obvious ghibli hits, porco Rosso is absolutely one of the best not many people think of. Beyond that they really aren’t as good (earth sea, ponyo, poppy hill, marnie, etc)"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Wind Rises is exceptional too, but maybe more mature, more subtle, and has no fantasy in it."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","One of the best endings in film history, imo."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Whoops that was my mistake.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I thought it wasn't weird all, it's pretty straight up The Little Mermaid with some ethics and mythology mixed in. Why would you call it weird? 
It isn't the typical Disney formula at all so that's true"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Yo that scene was also my favorite when I was a kid
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Yeah! It's gorgeous and trippy It's goes so fast, I forgot how to breath watching it!"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Both Ghibli, Ponyo is Miyazaki. 

I don't know anything Goro has made but Earwig, Earthsea, and Poppy Hill. I don't really like his movies as much. 

Watch The Secret World of Arrietty too, it was made by some Ghibli animators and on par with the rest. Same as Mary and the Witch's Flower.
Also Grave of the Fireflies if you want to be depressed.
A Letter To Momo is another one of my favorites, similar to the Ghibli style and same quality. Lu Over the Wall is similar to that, but more loose style. 
Mirai is really good for new parents, or for children getting a new younger sibling. 

I could go on all day. Let me know if you want more recommendations.

Edit nvm I see you aren't OP. Disregard."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Funny enough, I was indifferent to Ocean Waves first time I watched it but then as time went on it just grew on me. It’s a really quiet and small film but I think to it the most (next to Wind Rises) when I think of Ghibli. And honestly, it’s much more rewatchable for me compared to like Spirited Away. 

I was hoping Only Yesterday would be like Ocean Waves but that movie I just didn’t enjoy"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I can watch the opening to Up and probably not cry, because while it is sad, it is also a beautiful piece of fiction.  GotF is sad, and ugly, and is the author's fantasized autobiography (as in, what actually happened was even worse). I doubt I could even get through the first scene without ugly crying. I'd go into it more, but I really would hate to deprive anyone of the experience of seeing it with no preconceptions - it really is that good.

It's like Requiem for a Dream, except instead of an anti-drug movie starring adults, it's an anti-war movie starring two kids.

(edit: Fun GotF fact - for some reason, Ghibli made it a double feature with My Neighbor Totoro. I can't imagine the thought process behind that)"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",More. A lot more.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Schindler's List made me exhaustion cry for an hour after.  First watch for Grave of the Fireflies was weepy for sure. The second watch I was crying from start to finish.  I don't think I cried during Up just felt that emotional exhaustion.
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Same. I cry in movies a lot and this one didn't hit me that hard
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I always thought theusic of Ponyo was discount ride of the valkyries. The visuals of the movie are amazing and I like it very much overall.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","That’s sorta how I felt about Totoro. I rewatched it again after years just last week, and I realized it was just a couple little kids being little kids. It was so uplifting, and it was my girlfriends first watch of a ghibli film. Just all around a really feel good movie."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","It is a good movie, but there's just zero payoff. Nothing more about the other witches from the beginning? No real closure? Such a strange movie."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Kiki gaining confidence in herself, regaining her spark and feeling comfortable living life on her own terms?

And saving Tombo's life because of it."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",I'm hesitant to watch that one because you know where that's heading.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Totally agree on Wind Rises!  Along the same vein of no fantasy, I'd also throw in From Up on Poppy Hill.  I love that one, it's one of my go to pick me up films!"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",No worries.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","One is the part where a 5yo boy pledges his life to a millennia-old fish-girl. The other part is how weird mid-transformation Ponyo is. 3rd is what human blood does to Ponyo. Pretty sure Disney would have avoided many of the things Miyazaki chose to highlight in the film.

It’s just me, but it’s definitely weird."
"Conan, The Boy in Future",">I always thought the music of Ponyo was discount ride of the valkyries

Miyazaki actually drew his storyboard (for the tsunami scene) while listening to Ride of the Valkyries, and then gave the scene (and the CD) to Joe Hisaishi to compose the music. That's why it's very similar, but also very beautiful (in my opinion)."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","These comments are baffling to me.

The entire film is explicitly about Kiki discovering a place for herself in the world and dealing with depression and artists' block. She overcomes her creative block in the climax and the movie ends with a long montage of her gradually making the city her home, and writing a letter to her parents explaining that she's beginning to feel more confident, and that even though she feels sad sometimes, she loves her new life.

How does this not represent closure to people?"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","The payoff is she grows up/finds a place in the world, its a coming of age story"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",It's much more about the person than the war. It's an excellent film.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I mean Ponyo is a Disney movie in one sense, they own the distribution of all of Ghibli, brought Ponyo to American theaters. 

If you have seen any of the other Ghibli movies Ponyo is a bit tame in the very respects you mention. 

In Spirited Away a girl gets her actual name confiscated and her parents are shown transforming into pigs. A river is in indentured servitude to a witch for eternity. 
In Princess Mononoke there is lots of weird stuff with blood and  transformation, mostly with the main character slowly turning into a demon, and the transformation of the spirit of the forest to an unimaginable creature when disturbed by man. 
Pom Poko is a movie entirely about weird states of transformation and semi-transformation. 
In Howl's Moving Castle a girl transforms into an old lady and a guy turns frequently from a handsome man into a giant creepy war bird. A male child is seen transforming into an old man, and a female villain is seen transforming into a grotesque, but sweet, old lady. 
In The Cat Returns a girl turns into a cat person. 

It's kind of a theme of Ghibli really, and Ponyo is newer in their catalogue so I think it is a bit strange to find *that* aspect of all things weird."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Yeah, it is very beautifull, and I do enjoy the scene but I always have ride of the valkyries in my head while watching it. Feels such a miss not to use it for this scene."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Exactly. People seem to be looking for closure to a ""plot"" in Kiki, not realizing that thematically the film has a near-perfect ending. People's lives don't just gain closure during their adolescence - they find ways to cope and hopefully change for the better as their lives develop. That's exactly what Kiki is about."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","This show is seriously so good. It is aimed at kids but if you like any of Miyazaki’s stuff you’ll like this too. It was clearly a basis for his later movie Castle in the Sky.

I’d highly recommend checking this out for a fun watch. All of the subtitles episodes were available on YouTube in high quality, but I’m struggling now to find the link… I wonder if they’ve been removing them from YouTube because it’s coming to the US officially…

I’ll keep looking and post the link if I can find it!

Edit: yeah it looks like they may have started taking down those links, maybe this isn’t such good news after all"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",The What a Cartoon! Podcast recently did an episode on Future Boy Conan with guests Rebecca Sugar (*Steven Universe*) and Ian Jones-Quartey (*OK K.O! Let's Be Heroes*). It's a fascinating show and reveals how surprisingly influential Conan has been on American animation despite it's widespread unavailability here.
"Conan, The Boy in Future","If anyone watched the really good anime (about making anime) 

Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! 

They used scenes from this (remade scenes since they didn't have the copyright) to explain parts of animation in the first episode

"Conan, The Boy in Future",[deleted]
"Conan, The Boy in Future","It took ""only"" more than 40 years, thanks to Alexander Key, the author of the original novel, because he didn't like too much Miyazaki's vision...well, better late than never, I guess!"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","It didn't say it's coming to hbo, any chance?"
"Conan, The Boy in Future",Anyone remember Flying House?
"Conan, The Boy in Future","This show is legendary. Its regionalisation/dub in languages like Arabic gave it a following of many many millions of people outside of Japan (no exaggeration) over generations who love it dearly until this day for its beauty, honesty, and optimism. The author of the story, Alexander Key, and his estate prevented its broadcast in North America for decades, which is a shame. I really hope it gets the recognition it deserves there as it has globally for decades."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","I'm beyond happy.... If they actually go through with this it will finally become available for broader number of people to watch it.  
  
This series was a land mark in my childhood!  
  
I watched it in the original Japanese version, subtitled. Still the perfect version to watch, for me. I'm grateful and feel blessed that i got to see this at age 10 in 1983, at the dawn of everything ""sci-fi"", everything ""futuristic"" and ""space"", etc... The best of times to have watched this for the first time IMO 😀  
  
I was coming from the usual Disney and Marvel toons, and Heidi and Marco a couple of years before, and out of the blue, one beautiful Saturday morning in 83 THIS shows up on my TV screen... I was completely blown away from Episode 1, and never missed one since.  
  
Through the years i got every possible medium (official or otherwise) i could get my hand on. The last was the Blu-ray Memorial Box released in 2014. And have a properly ""cleaned up"" even further version of that, properly subbed. Much better even than the original version aired.  
  
I've watched this hundreds of times, so as my daughter, and i still can't take my eyes of the screen when this is on... I never get tired of watching this....  
  
  
  
The one thing i hope is, if they are going to dub this (and not sub it), that the dubbing makes the characters and story justice, as the original Japanese dubbing made."
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Also Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind! There is a lot shared between the two, even certain characters or scenes, it’s remarkable"
"Conan, The Boy in Future","Yup, the series was available on youtube, in a wide number of resolutions and versions, as well as languages for subs, and has been there fore some years.

Youtube in the last 2 or 3 months blocked every single one of them (including my channel).

I was surprised at first, but i got it now, after seeing these news....

What matters is it will be available to a lot more people now 😀"
The Jungle Book,"Greg:

Why do we rarely see the titans work together even after 3 seasons? It feels like they constantly split up for their own selfish reasons all the time and rarely work together as a team.

The Titans don't seem to learn anything from their past mistakes. Especially Dick grayson, who always goes lone wolf despite losing so many things because of it over the past 3 seasons."
The Jungle Book,"For Greg: Are there any plans of involving other comic Titans in future seasons, such as Roy Harper and/or Wally West?"
The Jungle Book,"Gar fans have been pleasantly surprised by the role he's taken this season, do you guys have anything special in store for the future seasons? Could we see him finally ditch the jacket for some form of upgrade?"
The Jungle Book,"Hi Laura! I love the outfit Rachel wears in season 3 during her visit to Temishira, it's very elegant and conveys tranquility and peace, just what she's looking for. But I'm also excited to see her new outfit when she returns! They really do a great and admirable job!"
The Jungle Book,"Hi Greg,i really like Titans but you guys have killed my favorite character Hank.. may i ask why and are we going to see some flashbacks with him in the future?"
The Jungle Book,"We will see more titans outside the main lineup or Batfamily characters? Like Bunker, Terra, Arsenal, Wally, Aqualad, M'gann, Cassie, etc?"
The Jungle Book,Will we eventually see Tamaran in its current state and not just flashbacks?
The Jungle Book,"My question involves the origins of Starfire’s new suit, an in-show origin of it. Where did she get it? Has she had it the whole time? And does it materialize over her body like Blackfire’s?"
The Jungle Book,Only reason I still have HBOMax is for Titans and Doom Patrol.   What are the chances there will be a season 4?   Are there any new superheroes expected in the last half of the season?   Great show.  Dark. Edgy.   Great acting and writing.
The Jungle Book,How different was the S3 production different to the first two seasons because of covid?
The Jungle Book,Did Deathstroke's daughter just disappear?
The Jungle Book,"How do the Titans keep getting away with breaking the law followed by no consequences??

-Dick broke prisoners out of Jail, then escaped himself 
-Dick assaults multiple officers
-Dick breaks Scarecrow out of Jail
-Jason Todd assaults & possibly kills multiple police officers in season 1 while he’s still Robin
-Conner assaults & possibly kills a bunch of policemen
-Conner & Gar murder ppl while under the control of Cadmus
-Conner & Gar terrorize a carnival while under the influence of Cadmus
-Gar mauls a scientist to death in season 1.. (self defense, but he didn’t have to go THAT far)
-Starfire assaults multiple officers in season 1 
-Starfire breaks her sister out of a government lab
-Starfire & Raven assault multiple officers while trying to break Dick out of Jail
-Raven unintentionally makes a gargoyle come to life & it murders someone
-Dove steals 25 million dollars & assaults multiple officers 
-The original titans (Dick, Donna, Hank, Dawn) all played a role in getting Jericho killed but everyone just blames Dick & doesn’t take responsibility 
-Barbara & Dick stealing jewelry for no reason in flashbacks?? 
-the titans (Rachel, Hank, Donna, etc) bullying Jason Todd to the point where he wants to jump off a building 
-Rose was a full blown murderer before she joined the Titans.. (when she broke Dr Light out of jail) Why is this not addressed more?? Why was she able to just join the titans after they found out she originally betrayed the team. 


I don’t have an issue with them breaking the law here & there, but why are these instances usually just forgotten?? It would be interesting seeing the titans get themselves out of these types of situations.. but the next day they’re just doing interviews & casually showing up at the police station"
The Jungle Book,Will this season be on Netflix and when
The Jungle Book,"Probably not the question you answer but why are the titans all criminals and why can they still walk into police stations no problem. Dick is a prison escape, starfire burned someone to a crisp, dove did a bank transfer heist, gar ate several people. At this point the only non criminal is krypto."
The Jungle Book,"After Trigon’s arc wrapped up, what may be ahead for Raven in the future? Any major developments coming for her? And when can we expect her suit?"
The Jungle Book,"Will this universe’s doom patrol ever make a return to the show?? & if they do, will Cyborg be with them as a new member??"
The Jungle Book,"
For Greg: In season 1 Kory worked on getting Dick to open up more, & eventually they decided they’d try again sometime once they figured out who they were. In season 2 their relationship took a backseat, and in season 3 it’s not there at all. Is there a reason for this regression? & with Kory regaining her memories & Dick now Nightwing, will we actually see them try again sometime?"
The Jungle Book,"For LJ, my 12 yr old son asked if you can make him a Red Hood costume because ""thats the perfect Red hood suit"" 🤣"
The Jungle Book,"Hey Greg, love the show. I wanted to ask, what can we expect regarding the future of ""TITANS?"" how many seasons can you see the show going for, and have you guys ever thought about doing any spinoffs?"
The Jungle Book,Will we ever see a return from Dove?? It’d be nice to see her for a special guest appearance in the future
The Jungle Book,"Blackfire’s eyes on the show so far have looked natural, but in recent set photos posted by the cast we could see blackfire’s eyes are purple. Does that mean anything big?"
The Jungle Book,"1) Why does Batman and the extended Batfamily have such a large role in Titans?

2) What runs are you primarily pulling from for your interpretation of each character?"
The Jungle Book,For LJ: Was Blackfire’s cape considered for her super suit?
The Jungle Book,"Is Rachel going to get time to shine? And why was she absent for most of the season?

I know the in-story reason why, but why was the choice made by the show itself?"
The Jungle Book,Did you consider having Jason killing other characters instead of Hank?
The Jungle Book,is kory anders bisexual?
The Jungle Book,"For Laura, what did you take inspiration from for Blackfire and Starfire’s suits?"
The Jungle Book,Will Gar eventually get a episode or two that can develop his character and story ?
The Jungle Book,"Greg:

Will Gar and Rachel's relationship be explored further?"
The Jungle Book,[removed]
The Jungle Book,For LJ: is there any difference between Starfire & Blackfire costume changing process? I want to know more details about Blackfire costume
The Jungle Book,"LJ- I really like how the show designed Nightwing's outfit, are there any new suits incoming this season?((Red) Robin for Tim Drake etc) Thank you for your diligent work adapting outfits from comics, they all look amazing."
The Jungle Book,I'm wondering why you guys decided to end s1 the way you did and have s2 episode one be what felt like should've been the final episode of s1 just curious on what the thought process was going into that
The Jungle Book,"For LJ: I love Red Hood’s suit, and am trying to make a cosplay of it. Any chance we’ll get better looks at different aspects of the suit and gear like the knife, belt, and back of the armor?"
The Jungle Book,For Greg Walker: I can see you are teasing relationship in the horizon for Conner Kent and Komand'r. Will that we explored even more this season as well potential season 4? It sorted of gave me a Maxima seeking the perfect mate vibe.
The Jungle Book,Will Rachel and Gar get actual suits?
The Jungle Book,Will we get any LGBTQ+ rep in the shows future?
The Jungle Book,Will Conner and Blackfire have an affair with each other?
The Jungle Book,"For LJ, what was the hardest suit to make and which was your favorite?"
The Jungle Book,could we see brother blood in future seasons?
The Jungle Book,Will we see Rose or Jericho again?
The Jungle Book,Would Kid Flash join Titans anytime?
The Jungle Book,Does Slades other son Grant exist in this universe?
The Jungle Book,Is there any plans for Gar to get a suit ?
The Jungle Book,will we get to see gar and rachel confess their feelings of love for each other?
The Jungle Book,Is there anything coming up in the future episodes that’s gonna make fans go crazy ?
The Jungle Book,"For Greg Walker: In Titans, we can see that some origin stories change, why does this happen?"
The Jungle Book,"Hi Greg, is there any chance, we Will see Wally West and/or Roy Harper on the show?"
The Jungle Book,My question is WHY DID YOU KILL HANK??
The Jungle Book,[removed]
The Jungle Book,Could we expect a suit transformation scene for Koriand’r like you did for Komand’r?
The Jungle Book,"1) will we see another batman villains references in this season?
2)Any Chance we will see Damien wayne the next season?
3) any chance that we get to see the batsuit and the batmobile?
4)is there any chance that we could see superman's suit ?
5)how long it took to build the robin suit for the show?"
The Jungle Book,If Titans get a season 4 will it actually be a Titans show? or will it keep been a Bat family show? Because season 2 and 3 do not feel like a Titans show at all.
The Jungle Book,"For Greg:  
  
Will we have any chance of Terra's character appearing in season 4?"
The Jungle Book,Any favorite random roles or characters from this season??
The Jungle Book,"Greg: I always felt Vincent Kartheiser's performance of Jonathan Crane felt close William Holtz the vampire hunter from Angel who kidnaps Angel's son as a baby, comes back as an Adult to get revenge on Angel and his team. When I see the relationship between Crane and Jason Todd it parallels to Holtz and Conner (Vincent Kartheiser). My question is did you use the Holtz-Conner dynamic for Crane-Todd in season 3 of Titans? Were you a fan of Angel tv show?"
The Jungle Book,Are we gonna see Rachel at all this season?
The Jungle Book,Can we expect Iain to suit up as Batman one day?
The Jungle Book,Would you ever consider bringing back Deathstroke?
The Jungle Book,Hi! I'm really liking season 3 so far and I'm curious as to what will happen with Red Hood in the future (beyond season 3). Is there a possibility of a spin-off? Anything you could tell us?!
The Jungle Book,Could we ever see Donna’s black suit in the show?
The Jungle Book,Is Donna ever getting her black suit? 👀
The Jungle Book,How does Wonder Girl die from electricity?
The Jungle Book,[deleted]
The Jungle Book,what can you tell us about souls? can’t wait to see rachel!
The Jungle Book,"Love Dick and Barbara dynamic. Hope the show does them justice. 

Also, love Conner and Kom dynamic. Really surprised by their explosive chemistry. They do seem interested in each other.

Well done on cultivating these dynamics 😍🙏"
The Jungle Book,Will we get to see Terra on further seasons??
The Jungle Book,"1. Are there any plans to add more heroes like wally west or any other Batman rogues besides scarecrow and joker?  Will we ever see HIVE?

2. Will Titans ever do another crossover with Doom patrol?  Dp season 3 has the brotherhood of evil which is also heavily connected to the Titans?  A beast boy and cyborg moment would be dope.

3. Will we ever see a Superman and superboy moment?

Keep up the good work guys!"
The Jungle Book,"We have seen the Titans fight the Batfam villains, but will we ever get to see them fight their og iconic villains like The Hive."
The Jungle Book,Will Rachel be important in the season finale? Because it seems like she won't have a lot of importance in the plot 😩😩
The Jungle Book,Will dick ever have the long hair look?
The Jungle Book,"In season 1 episode 1 Kory is heavily implied to have slept with the hotel employee before she got amnesia, is she bisexual?"
The Jungle Book,"For Greg: please tell me we get a lot more Red Hood in the upcoming episodes. I’m loving Jason’s arc, and I’m excited to hopefully see him talk to Molly again and see if she can bring the light back :)"
The Jungle Book,For Greg: Will we get to see Arsenal ever? Please say yes 🙏
The Jungle Book,Will Rachel’s presence in future episodes compensate for her absence from the season so far?
The Jungle Book,Will there be more seasons?
The Jungle Book,"For a brief moment we got to see scarecrows mask, will we get to see it again at any point?"
The Jungle Book,When will the third season be available in Latinoamérica?
The Jungle Book,"For Greg Walker: For Beast Boy/Garfield Logan will we get to see him turn to 3 to 4 different animals simultaneously maybe towards the end of this season since we saw teases of him partially transforming into a dog with his hand etc.,?"
The Jungle Book,Who is your favourite Titan who hasn’t yet been introduced into the show?
The Jungle Book,Did Starfire get her suit the same way black fire got hers?
The Jungle Book,"Will we see Gar change into other animals in the future? With the outburst we saw from him and that moment with the single paw-hand, it seems like his powers might be evolving?"
The Jungle Book,Have there been Titans that were planned to appear on the show but it didn’t end up happening?
The Jungle Book,Do you know when and where is season 3 coming in latinamerica?
The Jungle Book,"For Laura, whose were the hardest costumes to design or actually produce?"
The Jungle Book,Is Gar bi?
The Jungle Book,Why does every scene with Scarecrow seem to look like he was filmed seperately?  Was this a creative decision or some sort of scheduling thing?
The Jungle Book,Why is Raven so young?
The Jungle Book,Will Gar have a suit that will adapt to his transformation and not be completely naked when he returns to normal?
The Jungle Book,Will see Tim Drake as Red Robin this season or next season?

The Jungle Book,What do you take into account when choosing what to keep or change for suits from comics?
The Jungle Book,Is there a Titans storyline from the comics that you’d like to adapt which you haven’t yet?
The Jungle Book,Will we see the fearsome five at some point?? Or other Titans villains??
The Jungle Book,"Laura, I love the suits. Is there any chance that work has started on something for Tim in the future? 

Greg, I'm curious about the decision to include rape into the backstory of Hawk back in Season 1. I understand wanting to provide a darker history, but what was the thought process?"
The Jungle Book,"Greg and Shannon, will Gar and Rachel eventually get their suits on the show?"
The Jungle Book,when will gar get a suit? will dick ever be a team leader instead of break away?
The Jungle Book,"This is kinda a long shot but will these Titans be featured in anything else in the dceu, whether it be games or other movies ?"
The Jungle Book,Will we get to see BBrae? And will we get to see Trigon again?
The Jungle Book,What happened to Rose??
Dr. Klein,I'm not sure you could have more evidence against you for a crime even if the CIA was trying to set you up.  
Dr. Klein,"Anyone else notice when she let the cat out, the gate didn't close all the way?  Maybe that's how the killer got in?"
Dr. Klein,"John Turturro in the last 10 mins was excellent.  Reply, ""I don't know"" to everything.  Words to live by in real life. "
Dr. Klein,"Uhhhhh
I thought the pilot was great, legit 10/10 for me. But fuck me, I wanna binge this bad..."
Dr. Klein,The first show I've ever watched that made my heart race and made me nervous. Fuck that was good.
Dr. Klein,"The Night Of is a mini-series created by Richard Price (a writer on The Wire) and Steven Zaillian (wrote the screenplay for Schindler's List and Gangs of New York). It was originally called 'Criminal Justice' and is based off a British mini-series by the same name that was critically acclaimed. It was originally supposed to star James Gandolfini and it was a passion project of his, but then, well =[ (he is my favorite actor ever)....then it was supposed to be DeNiro, now it's John Turturro. Gandolfini is still listed as EP.

It has a few stars from The Wire like J.D. Williams and Michael K. Williams and some actors from Oz. The pilot is actually very good. Extremely chilling and tense. A lot of people have describe it as being like a better version of The Killing, also True Detective, and some people say The Leftovers although I don't really see that. There seems to some Wire in it too."
Dr. Klein,"Really confident opening. My only problem is that some of the knife stuff felt contrived, but that really doesn't bother me much. 

Bold choice to draw out Naz's night and the entire police process and get every ounce of tension possible out of both. So many shows would have the night last like 5 minutes, with Naz being woken up by police, cut to John Turturro taking the case.

Riz Ahmed is a fucking super star, though. Knocked it all out of the park. I wanna see more from him."
Dr. Klein,"He even can't say ""Doesn't matter had sex"" in his situation "
Dr. Klein,"Anyone notice at end of episode as the father sees that his car is gone a cat runs across the street similar color to one at the apartment, think that's got anything to do with the story ?
"
Dr. Klein,"Intense first episode, John Turturro is great even though he's in this for less than 10 minutes, and Riz Ahmed continues to astound me. Can't wait to see next week's episode."
Dr. Klein,"Wow, this was phenomenal.  Great at showing the perspective of the police and the defendant.  A terrific primer on what NOT to do if you are picked up by the police.  As someone with a legal background, it was fascinating to see the little plot points they are dropping that will be used later in the season  (e.g. [spoiler](#s ""the chain of evidence being broken, them not providing a lawyer when he asserted his right, and the witness from outside the brownstone lying about being alone, thereby opening up the defense to calling him an unreliable witness later"")  The interrogation reminded me a lot of the detective tactics from David Simon's book ""Homicide"".  I love the hyper-realism, and [spoiler](#s ""the cat making a reappearance at the end!"")"
Dr. Klein, That's some Miley-Cyrus-level Molly she popped to not even wince from a knife through the palm. 
Dr. Klein,"Enjoyed the pilot, however didn't like a few things (feel free to disagree).


- some dialogue/characters seemed cliche or lazy (e.g. first scene at the gym, the black guy saying ""i'm going to this bitch laphonda's with the phat ass)
- the police at times seemed unnecessarily aggressive or rude. to be fair, i haven't had run-ins with the police, so that could be more realistic than i thought. i'm sure race also plays into it.
- not a big fan of the 'mysterious girl who knows everything and is unflinchingly confident but also a complete mess' trope, but it seems unlikely her character's gonna show up again.
- people around Naz seemed to be acting unnecessarily strange in an attempt to raise drama-- everyone staring at him despite knowing nothing about the situation, etc. This could be a sort of distorted reality effect, though; from his perspective, everyone is staring at him, whether or not that's true.


On the other hand, I am excited about the show. I'm actually very interested in the boring procedural elements. I love the characters of Box and Stone. I also think that, in contrast to shows like law and order, the 8 episode arc for a single case will add an element of realism.

Sorry for the long post-- overall, looking forward to more episodes.

TL;DR  some cliches, but exciting show."
Dr. Klein,"You could also edit this show a bit and have the perfect documentary titled ""Why you should never stick your dick in crazy""."
Dr. Klein,"The dude was an idiot, he did everything possible to make himself look guilty. If you were a cop, you would arrest him as well and not think twice. He isn't even a victim of circumstance, he fled a murder scene and took the murder weapon for christ sakes!"
Dr. Klein,[deleted]
Dr. Klein,"I thought one of the two guys who call him a towel head before they go into the apartment, the guy with the doo-rag who stares ominously at them for a couple seconds, looked like one of the cops at the station. Anyone else notice this? Conspiracy theories aside, this was a fucking great intro this might be my new favorite show."
Dr. Klein,Was the hat that was hanging next to the deer missing when he wakes up?   
Dr. Klein,"Absolutely loved the first episode, so intense. It had a very true detective vibe as well I thought."
Dr. Klein,"What did that hearse driver say to her at the gas station?

I heard ""You're going to be my next passenger.""

Is that suspiscious to anyone else?"
Dr. Klein,"I really enjoyed the first episode, so afterward I went out and started watching the 2008 BBC series this is adapted from called [*Criminal Justice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_\(TV_series\)). It's enjoyable, but lacks the realistic tone and atmosphere that made the new show so captivating.

It'll be interesting to see how close the HBO series sticks to the original's plot, because so far they're nearly identical. The plot points of the 78 minute premiere of *The Night Of* happen as a compressed version over the first 25 minutes of *Criminal Justice* episode 1.

The biggest non-spoilery difference between the 2 shows seems to be the remake is setting up the Pakistani-American/racism in the justice system angle, while in the original the protagonist is a white man (Ben Whishaw) implicated in the murder of a biracial woman (Preacher's Ruth Negga).

The first episode is [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4HQYwkgxRM) and the other four are up via DailyMotion."
Dr. Klein,i liked it alot. the music reminded me of The Leftovers.
Dr. Klein,I don't know anything about this other than the promos HBO played before Game of Thrones. But for some reason I'm really looking forward to it. Gut feeling that this is going to be awesome. 
Dr. Klein,"It was great, honestly brilliant pilot episode to hook you up. Watching it felt like True Detective mixed with The Killing kind of atmosphere. Loved both, guess i'm in for a pretty nice ride."
Dr. Klein,"Richard Price is awesome.  I have read all his books and this show just feels like him 100%.  Love the accents, the boring procedural stuff, and working class attitude.  Can't wait for the rest of this series."
Dr. Klein,"The atmosphere/lighting/cinematography was excellent. They really made it feel like it was an inescapable nightmare the whole time. So much tension, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I was also really high though, so take this with a grain of salt. "
Dr. Klein,"John Turturro was excellent as the lawyer, for the small amount that he was in it. Kind of a bit disappointed that Robert de Niro didn't up playing the role though, would've been a welcome change to see him in something good. "
Dr. Klein,The pilot was pretty great. As a pakistani muslim i can say that they nailed that environment. Also the urdu dialogues were good. It also showed elements of islamophobia and how people perceive muslims as terrorists. The tension and the slow pace made for a nerve wrecking and intense experience. Riz ahmed portrayed naz wonderfully. 
Dr. Klein,"I was just watching whatever movies was on hbo at the time when this came on, took me completely by surprised. Great first episode, I'll be sure to check out the rest."
Dr. Klein,"For those who have seen the
British version, is this series supposed to emphasize on the court system or more of murder mystery? This pilot was so intense and I'm hoping they can keep it up while but afraid focusing too much on the investigation will dull it. Maybe not"
Dr. Klein,Paul or Pauline looked like Ben Stiller lol
Dr. Klein,"Turturro will always be Jesus from The Big Lebowski.  ""Nobody fucks with The Jesus."""
Dr. Klein,"30 minutes into the pilot and I'm still at a loss to exactly what this show will be about. I have done my best to avoid the trailers and other media on what this show is about. While it starts off slow and confusing, at pretty much the exactly 30 minutes in it picks up in a big way. So, you'll definitely want to give it at least that long before you blow it off. I'll update in another 30 minutes with my opinions at that point. 

So 30 minutes more into the show and damn is shit getting real. If you liked Nightcrawler then you will love this show. I mean for real. Great fucking work by the lead actor and the detective and the whole cast. "
Dr. Klein,"That was a really good first episode. As others have said, it felt a lot like true detective as a modern noir crime drama. The acting was great all around and it left me feeling so uneasy the whole time. I'm definitely excited for next week."
Dr. Klein,Didn't the first episode air like a week or two ago?  I know for a fact I watched episode one already.  did it premiere twice?
Dr. Klein,"Amazing episode, can't wait for the rest. Riz Ahmed continues to surprise me, very good actor."
Dr. Klein,"BEST FIRST EPISODE IVE SEEN IN EVERRR!! 

seriously that was like a thriller/horror movie. Me yelling ""DUDE GET OUT OF THERE"" and ""NOOO WHAT ARE YOU DOING""...and just the tenseness of the whole thing.

soooo gooood"
Dr. Klein,How many episodes is this supposed to have?
Dr. Klein,Enjoyed the first episode. Very well directed. My favorite type of show hopefully it keeps up. Looking forward to next week!
Dr. Klein,It was intense as hell lol. Looking forward to the next episode :) 
Dr. Klein,"The moral of the story is don't out your dick in crazy. Some of us just need some penicillin, some get our pet murdered, others go to prison for murder. "
Dr. Klein,"Did you guys notice there was a cowboy hat by the deer head when they first walked in the house, then it was gone when he left?"
Dr. Klein,"Damn that was intense. I was all sweaty and shit. Brilliant film making, even gave me a bitof an old school Coppola or De Palma vibe at times, despite being a lot less showy.

But, because there's always one, the very end made it seem like after this spectacular intro, the show will become a more conventional crime/courtroom drama. 

I hope not. 

But I'll keep watching."
Dr. Klein,"Can someone clear this up for me?

Wasn't this already out a while ago? "
Dr. Klein,Very good. Enjoyed every minute.
Dr. Klein,"I honestly could not make it past the momment he wakes up and leaves the house. It was so...cringy. 


I mean, everything he did just made me so upset. Breaking the window, grabbing the knife, grabbing the drugs, not calling the cops. I was just like ""UGHHHH"" cause I know whats going to happen for the next hour. I was so frustrated I turned off the TV.


Should I continue? "
Dr. Klein,"""I've never done drugs before, now let me take this completely unidentified pill from an absolute stranger."""
Dr. Klein,"I'm having a hard time understanding the time line of this show so far. It would appear only a couple of weeks has passed, but I can't believe the justice system would work that fast."
Dr. Klein,"For the people who said this was well directed can you care to tell me why? It's the same kind of direction of every other new dramatic cable show, ie GoT, Preacher, House of Cards, True Detective etc. Same lighting, same photography style, same kind of acting. There was nothing fresh, exciting or interesting about it IMO."
Dr. Klein,I liked it but goddamn it was *slow.* It did not need to be an hour and thirty minutes aka a fucking movie. 
Dr. Klein,No kidding. I thought it was a little contrived how many pieces of circumstantial evidence and generally unbelievable behavior from both Naz and Andrea (that's her name right?) had to line up for him to end up in the situation he is.
Dr. Klein,there couldnt have been more evidence against him if he actually did it.
Dr. Klein, Could have been a strait white guy.  
Dr. Klein,Cat is key to all of this
Dr. Klein,I picked this up in the very last scene with his dad standing in the street. There's a cat that walks by in the distance. It called me straight back to the scene where she put the cat out and then didn't close the gate. That's obviously how someone got in. 
Dr. Klein,"He was good, but I really gotta wonder how James Gandolfini would've been instead...and now i'm sad  "
Dr. Klein,"I mean in that kids situation, should he have just said no to everything right from get-go? Defer all questions?"
Dr. Klein,Lol yeah my mom called and told me aww hell naw this is a series? 
Dr. Klein,Well a little late to this thread but just successfully binged this on my 16 hour flight. 10/10. 
Dr. Klein,"I'm glad I'm not the only one. I had a pit in my stomach through the entire episode. It made me feel uncomfortable to the point where I had to ask myself if that meant I wasn't enjoying the show. 

Definitely looking forward to seeing where this story goes."
Dr. Klein,I don't really get the Leftovers comparison either. Seems odd.
Dr. Klein,"If you've never seen the film Four Lions, do.

Its a slight reddit trope to mention it, but its a british comedy about suicide bombers. All the creative team involved are brilliant (Peep Show, Thick of It, Brass eye)"
Dr. Klein,"I also felt the five finger fillet stuff (and several of the other events in the episode, along with the mysterious ""femme fatale"" cliche) felt contrived, but it was well shot and acted and I'm interested to see where it goes."
Dr. Klein,"Yes I believe the cat murdered her for putting him outside in the cold. Now it has come to the Khan family home to torment them further, thus the next episode is entitled 'Subtle Beast"", referring to the almost poltergeist-like tricks employed by the cat. The season will culminate in the cat murdering Nasir and finally leaving to the forests of upstate New York, thus this episode is named ""The Call of the Wild"". 

People in this thread keep mentioning Bodie and his staring friend as well as the strange driver but I truly do believe that the cat is at behind all this madness. "
Dr. Klein,"Maybe it means that the girl's house is within walking distance of his own residence? Or at least, however far a cat can travel in 9 hours. "
Dr. Klein,"right, and why did he say he was alone? and why did the camera do a close up of that guy he was with as they entered the house? seems almost too obvious that he's the killer."
Dr. Klein,"While the cops definitely were wrong by ignoring his request for a lawyer, there isn't any evidence that will get thrown out because of it. There was no custodial interrogation between the denial of a lawyer and when he got a lawyer. 

I also don't think the chain of evidence is broken, but abnormal. No way a court throws that evidence out, but the defense might be able to make some hay out of it at trial. 

The witness lying will be big I think. "
Dr. Klein,Cocaine. It was the cocaine. 
Dr. Klein,"> the police at times seemed unnecessarily aggressive or rude.

One of things that I love so far is their commitment to the NY feel of the series. As a born/raised NY'er let me tell you that they have the NYPD down *pat*. From the scene in the beginning with the cuffs to the environment of the precinct late at night (everyone ignores you while you wait to be processed, look at anyone too long and they'll fuck with you, always some sort of commotion that scares the shit out of you) I thought they did a great job. 
"
Dr. Klein,"I've gotta say, I am sort of glad they got that girl out of the show so early. I am not fond of that character type, and the show became infinitely more interesting as soon as she was dead."
Dr. Klein,"> This could be a sort of distorted reality effect, though; from his perspective, everyone is staring at him, whether or not that's true.   

That's how I see it, given that the show is supposed to be bit of a commentary on post 9/11 america and racist as well  
"
Dr. Klein,"I agree with everything you said.  There were several parts that made me roll my eyes, but I'm still very interested in seeing how it plays out."
Dr. Klein,"He was an idiot, but people do dumb shit when they panic. The vast majority of us won't wake up next to a murdered woman. Seeing something like that could get someone to run."
Dr. Klein,"The entire score was just phenomenal throughout the episode, especially the use of Mazzy Star. Then some comic relief when the CSU arrives, blasting hip hop, and then the contrast when Box rolls up bumping some classic Bizet. The only thing that sort of bothered me was the sympathetic piano when the lawyer sees Nas. Felt a little forced. But just a little. "
Dr. Klein,"The hearse driver is a suspect. Those two guys are a suspect. Khan himself is a suspect. His friend who bitches out is a suspect. Fuck it, the basketball team is suspect. This is some 'Scream' level ""everybody's a suspect"" shit."
Dr. Klein,I also noticed that. So many little things placed here and there that might be important or me just trying to connect imaginary dots.
Dr. Klein,See I thought the hearse driver was the black male cop. Same build and facial hair.
Dr. Klein,Oh shit. I think you might be right. 
Dr. Klein,anyone noticed the blood below the deer's eye?. Was it always there?
Dr. Klein,Fills that crater which is true detective.
Dr. Klein,That opening credits was so True Detective I almost thought HBO pulled a fast one and released a surprise third season under a different name.
Dr. Klein,She threw out a lit cigarette out the window of a gas station.  He walks up and says you're going to be my next passenger and puts out the cigarette on the window.. I think a little foreshadowing and him telling her she's going to get herself killed doing stupid things like that
Dr. Klein,No he was just telling her it's a dumb idea to smoke a cigarette and throw it out of the window near gas tanks. Pretty sure he's just going to end up being a witness.
Dr. Klein,"Yeah, it's supposed to be mysterious. The same way that the guy who called him a ""rag/towel-head"" at the police station said that when he saw Khan and the girl ""rubbing up against each other..."" that he himself was walking alone even though during that sequence, the camera lingered on his friend watching Khan and Andrea walk up the stoop and into her house. "
Dr. Klein,As soon as they left the petrol station I had a feeling maybe the hearse driver followed them or something. He was a strange dude.
Dr. Klein,He asked if she wanted to be his next passenger.
Dr. Klein,"Thing I did notice about this, that hearse driver left the gas station at the same time they did."
Dr. Klein,"I assume you've seen Four Lions?  RIz Ahmed is a great actor and he proved in Four Lions he can do believable complex Muslim characters.  I was very happy when I saw his name in the credits for this, there will no doubt be a lot of authenticity to it."
Dr. Klein,In the UK version the investigation is not the main plot line
Dr. Klein,[deleted]
Dr. Klein,"HBO released it early, so yeah all of us who watched it already have to wait *another* week for episode 2."
Dr. Klein,It was released early on HBO Now
Dr. Klein,HBO released it early online and on demand a few weeks ago. Tonight was the TV premiere.
Dr. Klein,It will have 8 episodes. 
Dr. Klein,"Was released 2 weeks early on HBO now,  probably to get people to keep their subs after Game of Thrones ended"
Dr. Klein,It was leaked or something
Dr. Klein,Go on. I'd also love to know how you acted when you woke up for the first time next to a dead mutilated girl you just had sex with.
Dr. Klein,"Most everyone in this thread seems to be in love with the show, but I agree with you. I could barely watch this at parts; an unreasonably immature protagonist combined with heaps of contrived plot elements made for lots of really cringy moments.

This kid's a tutor, so we know he's supposed to be smart from the get go. Drunk or sober, though, he makes bad decision after head-scratchingly bad decision. Why steal your dad's cab instead of taking a taxi, a ride share, the train, etc.? Why try to pick up the girl in the taxi instead of going to the party? I mean, if he was pumped enough to steal his dad's car and drive into town for it, why is one pretty girl enough to reroute him? Why not ask what drugs she's offering him before taking them, especially given his reluctance the first time? The knife thing... yeah... and that's just what happened before the murder and all the points you mentioned.

It didn't help that Riz Ahmed is way too old (34) to be playing Nasir. He did a great job, but casting a guy almost twice the age of the person he's playing just made the immaturity/stupidity even more striking.

Also, almost all of the drama in this episode is supposed to come from Nasir coming closer and closer to being found out and accused. Unfortunately, the building tension ultimately gave way to laughter at how poorly Nasir handled himself and how many unlikely coincidences the plot is built on; when you make 100 bad decisions in a row and get ramrodded this hard by chance, getting held on suspicion of murder is exactly what happens. This show wouldn't exist if he were actually the killer so there are bound to be interesting developments to come, but still, I don't pity him enough to care much what happens to him.

I'm going to read the Wikipedia article and move on. "
Dr. Klein,"Whats so... unrealistic about it for you? He (lonely, young male) was drowning in that girl, and she did the pills, and he would follow her almost anywhere in that state of attraction. He already started to brake rules (taking car without permission) that evening just to meet someone (at party, which obviously is rare occurrence in his life), so why stop?"
Dr. Klein,I think people are referring to how it builds tension without cheap tricks and other things like how much you can feel what Naz is going through even though no one is saying a thing.  
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,You played Charlie Cox’s dad in Stardust. Can we extrapolate this data to assume that Billy Russo is the father of Daredevil?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Not about Shadow and Bone but I loved you in The Punisher as Russo. If you were given the chance would you return to the MCU? Thanks!
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Can you please stop dying? I'm traumatized every single time
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben!

First, you're amazing in concert, I saw your first show in LA and loved it!

Second, I wanted to ask - we've seen Freddy fully embrace the Kazzle Dazzle name. I've seen The Darkling referred to as ""Darkle Sparkle."" I was hoping that you'd see this and the next time you and Freddy post things together, maybe you can refer to yourselves as Kazzle Dazzle and Darkle Sparkle just once?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Mr. Barnes, can you tell us a happy memory about Narnia?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Greetings Benjamin, I just want to know the name of The Darkling’s horse—if there’s no official name, I want to know what YOU think it would be. Thx"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Does Leigh Bardugo work closely with the show and if so, how is it working with her? She seems really involved when I check out her Instagram and seems like she has a great relationship with the cast."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"I've been in love with you since I watched you in Prince Caspian and Stardust when I was 12 years old. So ummmm will you marry me?

Just kidding. My question is, are you a Neil Gaiman fan? What other books do you enjoy?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What is your favourite type of cheese ? 🧀
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What comes natural to you.... Playing A Bad Guy or Playing a good guy? And Why?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Do you, as a person, think the Darkling is redeemable?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"I have two for you Ben
1. How would you describe The Darkling’s feelings regarding the women he’s impacted in the series ie Alina, Zoya, Genya, Baghra
2. Have you, at any point in your life, read fanfiction about a certain long haired, convicted murderer that turns into a dog at will and his friend group whilst they were at school?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Could you spoil one of the lines that you managed to sneak in this season? 🤧🤧🤧
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,DROP THE SKINCARE ROUTINE!!
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,How did you and Jessie Mei Li develop such great chemistry?? You guys sizzle on screen and seem like lovely friends off screen!
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,what music/album do you think fits the Darkling and his story?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi, now I feel guilty for not watching S&B yet."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Hi. Thank you for doing this! Hope you’re having a great week. The Polygon interview just got released so I’m wondering if you can share what your ideal rom com role is?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Which order of Grisha do you most align with?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"What was your experience like working with Zoe Wanamaker? Did you share a mother-son sort of relationship off cameras (if so, how many times did she hit your leg with her stick) or was the relationship like coworkers."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hey hi! if the darkling had a signature scent, what would it be?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,hello! how different was to play darklina scenes this season rather then the previous one?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What is your favourite book in SaB series?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,which character you wish the darkling had more scenes with?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,From the six crows which one would you most likely be friends with?

Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,which episode of season 2 would you say is your favorite?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Are you working on any new music soon?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"I first know about you as Prince Caspian and since then I’ve watched you as Logan in Westworld, Jigsaw in Punisher and Darkling in S&B. 

My question is, which type of characters do you prefer playing? The dark ones or the nice ones?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"If you could have any quote or icon from The Grishaverse tattooed on you, what would it be and why?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"You play fantastic heels in Shadow and Bone and Westworld. Will we see good guy Ben Barnes anytime soon? 

Also your long hair look is #goals for me. Any tips?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Have u ever read the picture of Dorian Gray
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,#RUSSO!!!
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What was it like being an audiobook narrator for The Lives of Saints and The Demon in the Wood for Leigh Bardugo? Was it a new experience? What was your favorite part?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hey! Great to have you here! I have following questions:

The darkling looks much older in the show than in the books (even though he is hundreds of years old in the books too). Dont get me wrong, you are a great cast for him! In the books he is as old as Alina, how do you think changes that ""up-ageing"" their relationship? 

And: are the costumes comfortable? Sometimes the keftas look kinda stiff and I am wondering about the scar make up too!

Cant wait seeing you all on screen soon again!"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"bin bons???? 

but in all seriousness, your performance as the darkling is truly insane- you bring so much nuance to this character while still making it clear that his actions are just.. awful. i remember growing up watching you play prince caspain too, so i guess my question is, who are your favourite literary heroes and villains? (p.s. i LOVE that you're an anna karenina fan too!)"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Since your have parents come from a fantastic professional mental health background, I wonder how they reacted to your roles of being an absolute psychopath. Did your parents ever recommended you to therapy looking at your immense sense of intrigue towards recently portraying a villain."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Not a question but you're great in Cabinet of Curiosities on Netflix.
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben!! Thank you for taking the time to answer fan questions on here. 

We know that you and Jessie watched Jane Eyre to prepare for the first season :) Did you do anything in particular with Jessie to prepare for Darklina scenes in the second season?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi 🥰
Can you tell us a bit about your experience with narrating audiobooks? Do you have any vocal warm ups you follow and how do you prepare for a day of recording? 

do you ever mess up or are you just (annoyingly) perfect

MUCH LOVE"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What was your favorite scene to film as Billy Russo in The Punisher?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,did any of your s&b castmates fangirl over you the first you met them? haha
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben!!! 

What would you say a typical filming day looks like for you? Any *rituals* or specifics you do before starting a scene or starting your day overall? 

❤️❤️❤️"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"What is the one project you've done that you'd suggest to someone who's never watched your work, that you think summarizes best what you are/represent as an actor? ❤️"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"If the show is renewed for season 3, do you think that you would feel comfortable returning as the Darkling (if/when he's killed off, if/when they go the resurrection route) considering that they massacred the S1 development and backstory of the character in favour of making Aleksander the scapegoat for the systemic oppression of the Grisha in S2?

You added a lot of humanity to the character and elevated him from a one-dimensional villain to a fallible human just desperate to save his people from persecution. From the S2 trailer, it seems that they just want to erase all of that work. Whether you step down or not, thank you for all you've done to give the Darkling depth and growth.

PS If they cast for a young Darkling to do any Demon in the Wood flashbacks, might you recommend Louis Partridge? He's perfect for younger you, even if you are ageless and immortal.  


Much love,

a fellow English degree nerd"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,How do you feel about the way the show handles the Darkling & Alina’s relationship/dynamic in the second season? Super excited to see it!
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"What was your favorite part about shooting for Season 2? Were there moments from the books that you were craving to do or new characters you were excited to meet? 

Also: you’ve played characters that come from books before; what makes Shadow and Bone stand out as another literary adaptation for you?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"In season 1 there were hints of the Grisha being an oppressed minority and you spoke about it in some interviews, but I have not seen this mentioned so far in any season 2 interview…did season 2 ignore how the Grisha were persecuted for hundreds of years before the Darkling lived???"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"As a long-time Shadow and Bone fan its exciting to see the characters come to life on screen, especially the Darkling!

Is there any aspect of the book version of the Darkling that you've primarily kept in mind while acting as him? Thanks!"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben, I'm rewatching Season 1 just now and I have to say it's still one of the greatest show on Netflix and your performance is brilliant.

Q: How does it feel to be the villain in Shadow and Bone?

I can't wait to watch Season 2."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben! Hope you’re doing well! My question is, what is your favourite thing about playing the Darkling? Is there a particular aspect of his character you find the most interesting or fun to explore? Thanks! 🖤"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben, you don't know how excited I am to have you back as The Darkling believe me this wait has seemed like an eternity haha. I know that you will have many questions to answer and I hope you can answer some of the ones that I am going to leave you:  
  
***1.- What was your biggest challenge that you faced in the recording of this second season?***  
***2.- What is your favorite dialogue of this second season?***  
***3.- This is not a question, I just wanted to tell you that if you keep giving shows I really hope you can come to Mexico to give even one show.***  
  
And I don't want to miss the opportunity to tell you how much ***I love you***, in fact you have been with me practically all my life since I met you in Narnia and I hope to have the opportunity to meet you in person very soon, I love you, I love you, I love you and ***I am very proud of you. XOXOXO***"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Which role is the most challenging for you so far, and why?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Whos your favorite shadow and bone cast member to work with?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"If you were born in Ketterdam alongside the other crows, what job do you think you would do in the gang?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Can you tell us your personal favorite episode of season 2? And any hope for Darklina fans??

On a side note, pretty ptlretty please do a fan convention in the US. (with a cherry on top)"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,How do you prepare for more intimate scenes like the kissing scene with Jessie?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,will we get more Alina and Darkling content?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Would the darkling listen to Taylor Swif?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hello from Italy 🤗
What are you favourite memories from shooting Shadow and Bone season 2?
I really love all your performances and I'm so looking forward to see the new season just because you're in it. Lots of love xx"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hello Ben! I have been a longtime fan of the series, and I love the nuance you bring to the Darkling! Book Darkling could feel like a cartoon villain sometimes, but you play him with so much care that the viewer sympathizes enough to hate themselves for rooting for him. 

Do you think the Darkling really cares for Alina as a person? If so, does he care about her because of her powers, or because she is the only one as endless as he is? Or is she just a pawn to him? 

Much thanks for reading, can't wait for season 2!"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"After shadow and bone, would you like to work with Jessie again? She's so talented, and you two work perfectly together."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi, you are amazing villain in Shadow and Bone. 
The Darkling is my most favorite character on the show.I'm so excited to watch season2.

You've played roles of villains/bad guys many times.
Your acting is just amazing. And you seem like a very nice person. How do you separate your work and your private life? Has playing villains affected your private life?

I also wanna know funny behind the scenes stories about Shadow and Bone.


Lastly, watching Shadow and Bone helped me get through when I was in my lowest point of life. Thank you for your amazing work and your costar's amazing work. The show is so special for me."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"I had no idea who you were before I watched Shadow & Bone but I became a big fan of the show almost entirely because of your scenes. Also I'm jealous I'll never be able to pull off an all black outfit like you can.

Anyways, you've been an actor for a majority of your life.  What is a role you wished you would be asked about more and why?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,How is playing the Darkling different or similar to your previous roles?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hello Ben ! I’m excited to see you back in season 2 ! And by the way, you have such a lovely singing voice ! My question is : What would be your dream project/role ?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Which episode from Season 2 is your favourite, and why? Also hi, love you <3"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hello Ben!! Not including the Darkling, who is your favourite Grishaverse character?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,what can you tell us about the darkest part of shadow and bone season 2?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Tell us one darkling's line you included in season 2
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,fav darklina moment from the books?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"What have you taken from your time as the Darkling? Either physical set objects, lessons, etc"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"besides your character, who's the most interesting character for this season ?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,what's your favorite thing about Aleksander?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Hi Ben! Please tell us whether we get any Darklina goodness in S2? 🖤
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"If you could make up another Grisha power, what would it be?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"hi ben, i'm rewatching s&b s1 rn and i love your performance more somehow. i remember the fandom basically going crazy when you were cast, was that an overwhelming response? did it make the role less or more daunting and you less or more nervous?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What was the most fun scene to film from season one?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hi Ben! 

My question for you is: if you could put any of the other movie or tv characters you played in the past in the Grishaverse (to be a hero or a villain, your choice) who would you choose and why?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,who do you think would be the darkling favorite author and why? 🫵🏻
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,Hi Ben! I love seeing your appreciation for the grishaverse books and Leigh - do you have a favourite scene from the S&B trilogy and a favourite scene from the SoC duology? Cant wait for s2!
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Even though you play the darkling (and amazingly at that), which shadow and bone character do you think is most similar to you?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hey Ben! Hope you're doing well.
I wanted to ask if you have any book recommendations, I trust your taste. Thank you! Can't wait to see Shadow and Bone on Thursday."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What’s your favorite book in the Grishaverse?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"hi! absolutely ecstatic for the release of season 2 and i was wondering if the grishaverse was real, what place would you choose to travel to?
i’d personally love to explore the jurda farms in novyi zem!"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What's your favorite line from the upcoming season? 🥺
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,How did you prepare for the audition as the Darkling??
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,who is your favourite crow?
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hey Ben! 
just wondering .. if you could play any of the six crows, which one would you pick and why?
sending love <3"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,why is darkling such an emo crying baby
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,What do you think about Jessie? 🙂
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hey Ben! You always seem like such a fun, loving nice guy in social media and interviews but seem to have a preference for playing bad guys (and wonderfully, I must say, I've loved your roles in Westworld and Shadow & Bone, but have been a fan since Narnia). Can you share with us why? I'm guessing it's because it's fun to pretend to be someone else, but I wondered if there are other reasons.

Also, revealing the Darkling's real name was a significant thing in the Siege & Storm book and a very memorable line from Alina in Ruin & Rising, but in the show it's mentioned very early in the story. Why the change?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"hello ben!!! i’ve been a fan since your narnia days, but your role as aleksander in s&b and the show in general has meant a lot to me—i was juggling an intense degree program and taking care of a family member pretty much alone when s1 came out, and it was an escape that brought me lots of joy and led me to some amazing friends. thank you for the passion and commitment you bring to your craft and all the roles you play! 

actual question time: who’s your favorite poet? are there any particular poems or lines of poetry that are (figuratively) forever engraved in your brain?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Hello!!! 🥰🥰🥰 I have seen you first in  ”Dorian Gray”at the cinema, though I was young, in my early twenties, and though I even deeply hated the book, you have done an amazing job, even then! But I loved you in “Easy Virtue”! And I adore your album!  In this series, though you are more good-looking than what I have pictured reading the books, you are still rocking it because I totally despise your character 😆 like in the books! And that means A LOT!👏👏👏 since I consider you a super sweet and handsome man!   


MY QUESTION:

Did you tried other characters in the show before be assigned to the General Kirigan? Or did you choose to do that role? Or were you being contacted only for that character?   


thank you 🙏 

I wish you well and have a lovely evening!

😘😘😘"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"hi bin bons, have you seen supernatural and would you ever consider working with jensen ackles?"
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,"Do you think The Darkling is right about that the path he wants to follow is the best for Ravka? 
Because after reading Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom I think that if The Darkling were ruling, the Grisha would never be THAT threatened."
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,When can we see you and Andrew Garfield together on screen? Hopefully in a Comedy? Or any other genre.
Ben and Hollys Little Kingdom,do you think the darkling and magneto would be friends
Curious George,Nine seasons and a movie!
Curious George,"Man my son LOVED this show as a toddler.  I credit this show in large part for teaching patience.  And by that, I mean to me.  I learned from this show how to be patient with my son’s own curiosity and how to encourage it to flourish in safe ways."
Curious George,TIL the Curious George tv show based off the movie adaptation lasted nine seasons. Wow.
Curious George,Curious
Curious George,Why did they cut off George’s tail?
Curious George,Books were good show is trash
Curious George,"Oh fuck yeah!  It's on now, bitch!"
Curious George,What is peacock?
Curious George,Curious george is the all time best TV show ever no doubt about that. I still watch it.
Curious George,Nice peacock commercial👎🏼.
Curious George,Neat
Curious George,"If only you could watch Peacock programming on a FUCKING TELEVISION, wouldn’t that be just swell."
Curious George,"Now that you mention it, bro my parents are the same way. I loved George and I think my parents learned encouragement about creativity from the show. They learned that creative people are different and they helped me be accommodated. Thanks for sharing!"
Curious George,To stop him from growing into a giant monkey every full moon.
Curious George,"to all the downvoters, this is a tongue-in-cheek Mandela effect reference."
Curious George,I think George is a chimp and they don’t have tails 🙃
Curious George,"No, everything curious george is amazing, anything else is trash"
Curious George,"Oh you.  You’re no fun.  But seriously, I find the Mandela Effect a fascinating phenomena.  As a philosopher I try to be open-minded about the parallel universe theory to explain the differences, but logic wins the day and I accept that it is just bad memory.  However there are some examples of the Mandela Effect that I find truly mind blowing.  For example, a great many fans of LOTR The Fellowship of the Ring believe that when Gandalf is hanging from the precipice he yells, “Run, you fools!” before falling.  Actually he says “Fly, you fools!”  Also Star Wars fans believe that C3-PO is completely gold coloured, but actually he has a silver leg.  Go check these out for yourself.  So parallel universe, or Mandela Effect?  You decide."
Curious George,I think he’s too small to be a chimpanzee.  I preferred him when he used to have a tail.  He looks funny without one.
Curious George,"I have this really weird theory where whenever I get a strong sense of deja vu from something I've never done before, it's because this stuff has already happened and I'm reliving a past life.

It's not something I take seriously tho."
Curious George,"Other people believe that as well.  I don’t personally hold to it myself, but there is a well-established theory that describes time as circular.  Either when a person dies they relive that life again with their memory wiped (Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence idea), and the errors in the wipe appear as déjà vu.  Or that the entire life of the universe repeats itself by expanding and then collapsing again into a singularity followed by another Big Bang and a duplicate universe etc, etc.  In that model moments of déjà vu are you remembering the last time you went through the loop."
Curious George,"That reminds me of an interesting Batman story where Batman attends his own funeral as a spirit, only to find friends and enemies with costumes and designs from different eras of the franchise, telling conflicting stories of his death. and it's revealed that all the different and varied interpretations of the character (goofy 60s Adam West Batman, Animated Series Batman, Dennis O'Neil Batman, etc.) are actually the result of Batman dying and being reborn in different universes for eternity."
Curious George,"Woody Woodpecker is only massively popular in Brazil. The old shorts, as well as the 90s/00s reboot, have been broadcasting steadily there for 40 years, and a 2017 live action Woody Woodpecker movie received its only theatrical release there. 

Peacock currently doesn't stream outside of the United States, so it's unlikely they'd reboot the character without its core demographic in place."
Curious George,Then how about make it a Hulu exclusive for America and Brazil?
Curious George,"a) Hulu is majority Disney owned and b) Hulu only has between a 10 to 15% market share in Brazil. NBC/Universal's incentive to share a small piece of a small pie is pretty low.

Netflix dominates streaming services in Brazil, so NBC/Universal would be more likely to go that route. It's questionable how profitable that IP would be for them and whether they could generate interest stateside. Looney Tunes' HBO Max reboot has only been a modest success --- and Looney Tunes is a massive IP compared to Woody Woodpecker."
Curious George,Ok maybe say Peacock for the US and Netflix for Brazilian audences.
Curious George,What dose Disney have like a right to refuse original ideas?
Curious George,Nice try Peacock intern.   You should have been an NBC page!!!!
Curious George,"You clearly have no clue on how things like the cost of obtaining rights to do things like crossovers. Why would a fledgling streaming network grant a show based on a property hardly anyone remembers (granted they have already done this) BUT also throw so much money at it so that it can have some random list of other properties be involved just for the hell of it? 

Take your meds or come off what you’re on and then go back to the drawing board. The idea sucks. Sorry to sound so rude but you asked."
Curious George,A man coming from a very conservative family in rural Alabama trying to make it in Liberal Hollywood as an actor without compromising his political beliefs
Curious George,"The Office 2


Follows the wacky adventures of Brian the cameraman.


Now pay me."
Curious George,This reminds of of the Parks & EEC clip where Patton Oswalt is just adlibbing about a movie that ties in every character he can think of.
Curious George,Lil Katie  - a show about Katie Couric’s middle school years
Curious George,"I’d do a few things:

-	Start rebooting shows. Newer shows, older shows - if it’s brand is worth anything I’d be making new episodes of it.
-	Take failed or short-lived shows and twist them into an extended universe. Use it as a platform to take lots of talent and mix up casts to see where the best chemistry is.
-	GET MY ENTIRE GODDAMN BACK LIBRARY FRONT AND CENTER. Not just the big retro sitcoms, but everything. NBCU has a century of films, shows, and live events - they should all be available.
-	I’d create a reality TV competition where people compete to create the most interesting new sporting events.
-	I’d pour money into those sports so that I owned the leagues and the TV rights, so that I could put-compete other leagues and streaming platforms by owning the whole pipeline."
Curious George,They should shut it down and sell The Office back to Netflix.
Curious George,The Squid Game --- This time it's Real!
Curious George,[deleted]
Curious George,"""The Next"": A young TV executive has worked their way up from NBC Page to their dream job of executive with NBC, unfortunately it's during the dying days of network TV. It follows them as they try to find new original programming often pitched to them as ""The Next Seinfeld/Friends/The Office etc"""
Curious George,"Ludacris and tyrese Fast and Furious show.

Or any live-action fast and furious show. Its Universals best IP, how they havent greenlit anything from it for peacock is mind-blowing especially because it could be an actual racing show which would allow it to have a lower budget."
Curious George,Ghost mutt
Curious George,Do live action exo-squad
Curious George,"While it is good that programming has become much more inclusive, female centered and deals with social issues, there is a lack of upbeat, wholesome programming.  In the rush to address and shed a light society's problems, networks and streaming services have forgotten there are people who like to watch TV as an escape. Some of the current programming, is too heavy handed in its messaging.  Look at the success of Ted Lasso, which was not only upbeat but maybe one of the few shows today with a male lead that is competent and a good person.  Ted Lasso found an audience for people who had given up on current programming."
Curious George,Alright but what do you think of my idea?
Curious George,"Unless the properties are owned by the same people who created them then it would cost less.

The real cost would be seeking out the producers of the oringial properties."
Curious George,"Nice.

Your thouhgts on my Peacock idea?"
Curious George,Nice your thoughts on my idea?
Curious George,"Nice, what do you think of my idea?"
Curious George,"Oh ok but whar do you think of my idea

BTW, it's an animanted cartoon."
Curious George,"Ok, but this is an animated cartoon."
Curious George,Excuse me but did you get my reply
Curious George,"Or how about part racing show, part music festival, part auto show and part Coachella? Call it, Fast and Furious Horzion."
Curious George,Good idea.
Curious George,"Maybe, but your thoughts on my idea?"
Curious George,[deleted]
Curious George,Why is it god awful?
Curious George,[deleted]
Curious George,"Why? It'll have a star-studded cast including Mark Taylor, Ted Danson, even the One Chicago cast."
Curious George,[deleted]
Curious George,Because it would be a proving ground for crossover shows. Like my idea.
Curious George,Did this revelation really demand 300 words?
Curious George,[removed]
Curious George,"I agree, though I think most people were aware that Dora the Explorer and Umizoomi are geared at children rather than adults."
Curious George,Yes.
Curious George,"Sure but the larger picture I’m getting at is that good tv can be good tv even if you, personally, don’t like it."
Curious George,Cougartown
Curious George,"Parks and Rec changed completely. They originally wanted to do “The Office” and made Leslie a sort of incompetent, hard edged boss. After the first season, they realized she wasn’t incompetent; she was sweetly naive and good hearted. The show took off once it stopped being mean."
Curious George,New Girl. It starts from a show centred around Jess to completely shifting to a show centred around the main characters and their quirks
Curious George,"I would say The 100. First episode is soapy teen drama, well first couple but later episodes goes to the dark side real quick."
Curious George,"I would say Doctor Who. When the show first aired in 1963, The Doctor was stablished as a weird old man with a time travelling machine, living in a trash yard with his granddaughter. Eventually as the show progressed, they stablished a bit of The Doctor's backstory, like him being a renegade Time Lord from the planet of Gallifrey, who stole a TARDIS and ran away from his own people. 

But the biggest change in the show came when the actor William Hartnell, who played The Doctor, became ill and was incapable of reading and remembering his lines properly. So the solution was to change actors and write Hartnell off as his Doctor dying of old age, but being reborn with a new face. Thus, the concept of regeneration was introduced into the show."
Curious George,"I commented this a while back about *Community.* It's weird how ""grounded"" everyone is. Jeff seems extremely scummy, Troy is a jock who speaks in ebonics, the Dean seems like he can actually run a college, Chang seems like he can actually teach a class, Abed's more pronounced/realistic with his Asperger's, Britta is a straight man (i.e. foil to the comic relief as opposed to *being* the comic relief), and Annie and Shirley kind of just...exist? They aren't as distinguished character wise. The only character who seemed pretty locked in from the get-go was Pierce.

But as the season goes on, it's interesting seeing how people are slowing morphing into themselves. You can see Troy and Abed's bromance blossoming, Britta actually not being perfect, Chang's moments of pure insanity, and Jeff possibly having a heart. It's actually VERY fascinating to experience having not watched the show for almost 6 years.

Edit: Wow, season 3 really isn't popular around these parts is it?"
Curious George,"Rusty Venture acts just like his father in the pilot of The Venture Bros, *The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay*: Brilliant inventor, implicit sexist, paternal elitist.  Might as well be Jonas Sr.

He was changed into a sniveling, drug-addled, dysfunctional Johnny Quest for *Dios De Los Meurtos*, and the change stuck."
Curious George,"Person of interest. I dont want to say the characters changed much, but the show itself is a lot different after the first episodes"
Curious George,Family Matter def. morphed from a show about a Black family to the weekly adventures of Urkel
Curious George,"While there are a lot of examples of this, I always thought Dexter and Regular Show went down this path rather quickly.

For Dexter, early on the code is made into this extremely important thing that is essentially the only thing keeping Dexter from becoming a monster and going to jail. The problem is, Miami PD kept getting less and less competent that I am relatively certain I could kill someone, in broad daylight, in front of the police force and **still** get away with it, because Dexter picked up a piece of evidence or explained things in just a way they completely overlook what they saw. 

Jess ""Did that man just bash that person's head in with a hammer?"" Dexter ""No. The blood suggests a sniper."" Jess -on radio- ""Everyone, keep an eye out for a sniper."" 

For Regular Show, it was originally about two friends slacking off at work, leaned more into the surreal side and got really fun and then leaned into more of a show about dating and relationships, only to end up a climatic battle to save the universe."
Curious George,"Adventure Time.

In the pilot Finn and Jake are just fun, comedic heroes with no trauma and Ice King is just a wacky, unsympathetic villain."
Curious George,Halt and Catch Fire
Curious George,"How I Met Your Mother is a weird journey as it began as a VERY forgettable, cliche riddled sitcom, evolved into something so much more by the end of the 4th season and then saw every character completely Flandersized, reduced to catch phrases and signature quirks by the end of its run. 

So very strong in the middle, but real rough at the beginning and end."
Curious George,Show someone the first episode of Twin Peaks and then The Return.
Curious George,Michael Scott is an ass throughout the whole first season.  They had to redo his character to make him more likable.   They had to do the same thing with Andy later on as he wasn't orginally supposed to stay.  So they sent him to anger management.
Curious George,Family Guy
Curious George,"ER. It started as a somewhat gritty and almost nihilistic view of urban emergency medicine, ended up being a soap opera that happened to involve medical professionals 15 years later."
Curious George,"24's entire first season really. He becomes a lot more a action hero star after that season. Although, I can't quite articulate why I feel this way.

Also, I can't mention 24 without mentioning the greatest subplot of all time. Kim and the cougars in season 2."
Curious George,*Person of Interest.*
Curious George,"I don't know if this was the pilot, but Caboose sure changed from when he first appeared in red vs blue to later episodes/seasons"
Curious George,"This is basically every show. I suspect one reason is once the people who make the show see the pilot they made, they have a much better idea of how they *should* make it. Its much harder to do something completely from scratch in your head. But changing something you can see, that was 70% right, is a lot easier."
Curious George,I am really glad they changed Sheldon because I wouldn't have liked the original Sheldon.
Curious George,"Red Oaks on Amazon. A show that takes place in the 80s at a country club. First episode makes it out to be a raunchy sex comedy like Caddyshack which I was all in for. No boobs in any other episodes and becomes much more dramatic and less silly. I still really liked it, lots of 80s nostalgia, but not at all what it presented in the first episode."
Curious George,"Succession, except that 'period' actually lasted quite a few episodes before it became what it is today"
Curious George,Big Bang Theory
Curious George,"The first season and pilot of office also was trying to be more like the office uk which was only ever a one season thing and that version of Michael in the US version would never, ever have worked long term so he was changed quite a bit.  
   
Andy from the office also had a change with his “anger management” stuff and they basically redid his character.  
   
A lot of that isnt totally about pilots not being their main shows but just setting up basic character premises that adapt and change over time and in many cases are flanderized"
Curious George,"Mandy from Last Man Standing.
She went from naives/kinda clueless, it not dumb to not being able to outsmart a rock."
Curious George,The Magicians
Curious George,"with  ""Flanderization""  i get reminded of Homer Simpson. His character changed so much during the seasons imo."
Curious George,"The pilot you are talking about for Big Bang theory was never actually aired on TV, so it wasn't the true pilot of the show and was completely changed (obviously) and the only characters that are the same are sheldon and leonard"
Curious George,[deleted]
Curious George,The 100. Jesus Christ the 100.
Curious George,can we stop calling all first episodes 'pilot' episodes. they are not.
Curious George,Alllll of them?
Curious George,This might be the most correct answer. The pilot was a cliche Courtney Cox is a cougar plot.  By the the end of season one it was the non-hospital parts of Scrubs set in the Suburbs with more wine.
Curious George,"Okay, Abed"
Detective Conan,Didn't want to time Murderville's release with this?
Detective Conan,"lol Haven't watched Detective Conan for a long time. Still waiting for the Black Organization plot to progress somewhere meaningful. I know they've revealed the identity of the boss, but AFAIK, that plot didn't go anywhere yet."
Detective Conan,I watched Case Closed back in the adult swim early anime days. Crazy how DET Conan has like 1000eps and dozens of movies and a lupin the 3rd crossover?
Detective Conan,Ok I definitely thought this was a different [detective Conan](https://youtu.be/86AWS25JKm0) (it's called Case Closed in English I believe). Kinda funny that there are multiple
Detective Conan,"I only watched the first Adult Swim dub of Detective Conan back in the day and I just ""Ah neat! Goofy anime murder mysteries. Awesome.""  


...I'm watching this and I don't see any goofy murder. Is this not that?"
Detective Conan,KEDAKAI
Detective Conan,"Ra—I mean *Rin* (She’s still Rachel to me) still hasn’t figured out that the kid she and her dad’s been watching over’s Jimmy the entire time, even though she grew up with him, and would know, but rants aside, yeah, the show just doesn’t get the plot moving very much, if at all."
Detective Conan,"The black organization is a joke, almost all Members are double agents"
Detective Conan,"I remember being so disappointed finding Detective Conan/Case Closed online and realizing they never wrapped up the storyline and Rachel still hasn't even found out Conan is Jimmy after that many episodes. 

Still really fucking good for the mysteries though."
Detective Conan,This is a spinoff of the other Detective Conan.
Detective Conan,This seems to be a spinoff featuring a character that must have debuted wayyyyy after I left off of the series.
Detective Conan,"To be fair, the first 400 episodes were some of the best episodes in crime drama amongst anime. After which, it just kinda dwindled in quality and I'm just waiting for the inevitable end.

Same with the Detective Conan movies. The first four movies were great (the fourth one being the best IMO), but other than a select few (like movie 13 and 20), most of them aren't worth watching."
Detective Conan,"It's realistic that she doesn’t figure it out, though. For anything weird she notices, the explanation ""oh, of course, Conan is actually Shinichi (Jimmy in the dubbed version), who has been rejuvenated"" is so outlandish that any alternative explanation will seem more reasonable."
Detective Conan,">Rachel

>Jimmy

*""Eat your hamburgers Apollo""*"
Detective Conan,"I think all that stuff is like ""Well time to end the manga"".  Occasionally dipping back into that endgame plot."
Detective Conan,I really followed detective conan when it was 1999. Those were fun episodes.
Detective Conan,"Looking back, I don't really believe that she hasn't figured it out yet. It's not been that long since I watched the anime, so I still remember Ran enough that she acts as if she's merely not telling Shinichi that she has figured it out.

In fact, there have been more than a few occasions in the past where Conan has pretty much spelled it out for her already, albeit not directly. There have been many times when Ran acted like she's in the know, but acted otherwise and played along. Ran is not stupid, and she's sharp enough to even play detective in many episodes, so the only logical explanation is that she's playing along.

In fact, in OVA 9, ""The Stranger in 10 Years"", Ran's reaction towards Conan telling her that made it pretty clear that she's already figured out Conan is Shinichi, but chose to wait for him to tell her the truth anyway. I know that Ran was a product of Conan's dream sequence, but man, that entire OVA acted like it was a possible future before the ending that I couldn't just dismiss it as a mere dream sequence."
Detective Conan,"Tbh I don't any sub-13 y/o actor can play Conan.Playing an adult who is trying to be a kid is a lot to ask of any inexperienced actor. Maybe they can age Shonichi, Ran, Haibara etc. by 7 years and then have Conan be a 12 y/o. That might work as they can then cast a 14 y/o actor"
Detective Conan,Isn't that story still running without a conclusion?
Detective Conan,I hope Netflix doesn't see this post.
Detective Conan,To be fair Netflix counts people who clicked on a movie not people who watched the movie and says that's the amount of people who watched. We know people may have clicked on them but until studios are forced to show watch time we won't know what's really popular
Detective Conan,"Sherlock and I assume Lupin are public domain, cheaper"
Detective Conan,You betcha. Although there have been major developments against the antagonist. All the author needs to do is start the final confrontation.  I think he just loves writing new ways to kill people every week.
Detective Conan,I genuinely dont understand the negative reaction to the suggestion. Its a popular property that seems relatively easy to adapt and could be the kind of broadappeal family show people rewatch quite a bit.
Detective Conan,"Here is a link to the Cox cable areas that offer it, as well.
http://utbhollywood.com/COX/index.php"
Detective Conan,"I’ve only watched the Conan episode and to be fair I was expecting it to be funny no matter what, considering him and Will have this great chemistry, but oh man it was actually even better! I’m definitely excited to watch the other episodes. I was actually unaware of a British version so it was fun watching it without comparing the shows.

Edit: omg. The one with Kumail where he needs to walk. I cried!"
Detective Conan,"Thought Conan absolutely smashed it out of the park. He delivered some great laughs and was so smooth at improvising that I never would have known he wasn't given the script if that wasn't the premise of the show.

Looking forward to watching more and seeing how others handle this."
Detective Conan,"I've only seen the first episode so far, but oh man, I want more Conan improv. If there's another season, I really hope he gets another episode PLEASE."
Detective Conan,"Actually thought this was excellent! Improv can be really hit or miss and every episode can be guilty of that. But every episode has gotten a good laugh from me! Personal fave episode was the kumail one! 

Would love to see a second series of this."
Detective Conan,I watched the first 3. All were entertaining but Kumail absolutely had me rolling in his signature walk/sound scene. I was legit in tears.
Detective Conan,"Only watched first episode so far, but oh man this is good.

Conan's magic story how >!he got savagely beaten for 40 minutes by future US senators!<

And the murderer who >!got handcuffed and immediately took them off?!<"
Detective Conan,"I've watched a couple of episodes now and watched a good handful of the old BBC series and I've got to say I really like it. 

Tom Davis was great in the original, but Will Arnett is an inspired choice. He's funny, he can do characters well and most importantly he's terrible when it comes to corpsing, which is where these shows funniest moments come from."
Detective Conan,"I liked them all. Marshawn is my dude and I watched him play so that was cool. A lot of motherfuckers in that episode.

Ken Jeong was hilarious. He kept breaking character over and over and he really had fun with it. Either his or Conan was probably funniest for me.

Arnett was really really good carrying the show. I was impressed overall with him in particular."
Detective Conan,"Episode 3 had me actually dying, I love the improv!"
Detective Conan,I loved when conan cracked the lead mom from MAMA
Detective Conan,"I watched the 4 episodes so far it was pretty fun, I like the part when the guest figure the murderer with their reasonings, especially when >!Annie Murphy made up a dying message that was pretty hilarious but it kinda make sense.!<"
Detective Conan,That Sloppy Joe scene had me dead. Clearly see Will nearly crack
Detective Conan,Kumail’s dumb walk made me laugh harder than anything else has in a while lol
Detective Conan,"Bagavitch: Im gonna split that motherfucka like Wood

Seattle: Like a piece of fucking wood!

Bagavitch: nah like a backwood

fuck sakes lol i love this show

&#x200B;

Edit: Marshawn looking distracted as the police chief is talking and then him wondering why she looks so unsure is such a stoner situation"
Detective Conan,Ken was so fucking adorable. Every time he broke character I giggled and cried with him out of joy. It also looked like they were just having a lot of fun shooting this. Snakes in the den killed me. Honestly I love Arnett but in this episode my eyes were fixated on this middle aged Korean American doctor guy. Gotta rewatch community now.
Detective Conan,"I loved it. I think Conan's was by far the best, and both Kumail Nanjiani and Ken Jeong were a blast. 

If I had any complaint, it's that it was clear that some of them weren't taking the bait on certain bits. (Ken having the earpiece in the jail cell lasted all of like ten seconds; I'm sure they had to cut a lot of stuff that just didn't work.) But that's a minor problem that I think is always going to be inherent in any improv."
Detective Conan,Annie Murphy was so cute. Especially in the kitchen scene omg
Detective Conan,"I came into this not knowing anything except it was Will Arnett, and that's always good enough for me to check something out. As a huge fan of improv I thought the episode (and the series) is fantastic. 

I think the ""ID the murderer"" angle is very creative. I'm actually not sure if that part is real but I like the idea either way.  I'm really looking forward to new guests who might be a little surprising. Someone like Harry Connick, Jr. who is not known for being funny but is freaking *hilarious*.

An overlooked show that I think would be a big hit with Murderville fans would be the US version of No Activity on Paramount+. Almost entirely improvised, with a stellar cast including Jason Mantzoukas, Amy Sedaris, Jesse Plemons, Tim Meadows, Arturo Castro and  many more."
Detective Conan,"I only saw the fist episode and if the rest is good as much as the first one they really did a good job. If this turns out as a hit show they can make many episodes with different guests. There are so many people they can use like Liam Neeson because he is really good at improvisational comedy. Check this out: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajV17XhEo_Y&ab_channel=TimXeriland"
Detective Conan,"It's a fun show, but I can't help but wonder if it would be better if it was actually on an improv stage with an audience in the style of *Thank God You're Here.*

I don't know. It's like there's something important that's missing.

Hopefully, when the pandemic is over in 2052, they can have a live audience. I never thought I'd say this about a TV show, but it also needs to have a lower budget so it can feel more like a live performance. There are too many camera cuts and a weird filter. It makes it feel like a scripted show that's just pretending to be improvised.

But despite my dumb criticisms, it has a lot of potential and several great moments."
Detective Conan,"Went into this hoping for the best and it delivered. Conan and Sharon were phenomenal. Marshawn was hilarious, probably my favorite. Ken and Kumail are surprisingly awful at improv."
Detective Conan,"This show was hysterical, especially with the good guests. Also noticed a lot of MADTV actors in this show. It threw me back to middle school days seeing those familiar faces!"
Detective Conan,"Annie Murphy was the best!! :) I love that episode.

The show is awesome! I can't wait to see another season ( hope there will be one or more!)

And more improvised or semi-improvised (if there is such a thing) tv series :D"
Detective Conan,I love this! I don’t find a lot of comedies that funny but this got big laughs from me right from the first joke about his dead wife. The scenes in the cafe and the magic show both had me cracking up!
Detective Conan,"> In [the] UK original co-written by star Tom Davis and directed by James de Frond, the laughs come in part from the show’s setting in the fictional city of Successville, a place populated solely by famous faces. And when I say famous, I mean OK! Magazine, TV chef, Strictly Come Dancing judge-famous. Every so often a world-straddling Beyoncé, Madonna, Obama or Vladimir Putin will appear, but mostly for how silly they sound mentioned in the same breath as ITV’s Ant and Dec or DIY TV show presenter Nick Knowles. 

I'm surprised the Netflix adaptation ditched this part, which IMO is what makes the UK version better. Will Arnett did a decent job tho."
Detective Conan,Watching E1 now.  Frikkin awesome.
Detective Conan,Got through Conan/Marshawn/Kumail in one sitting and I am in love with it so far. This has gotten more laugh out loud moments from me than any show in a while.
Detective Conan,Sharon Stone and Will Arnett felt like they could really have their own murder crime show.
Detective Conan,"Brilliant, Will Arnett is incredible!!"
Detective Conan,"The Marshawn Lynch episode is hysterical. Especially when he just casually knocks a bunch of paperwork out of some random office worker's hands like he's just a straight up bully.

I also just about died when they are whispering to each other and the suspect goes ""guys, I can hear everything you're saying""
And then Marshawn just flexes on him and yells ""Well act like you can't! The fuck!?"""
Detective Conan,So many murder mystery comedies on tv now. I like it.
Detective Conan,This show made me remember the Australian improv show Thank God You’re Here and now I want to go watch that again. Fun concept.
Detective Conan,"It feels too polished to me, compared to the UK version where it was deliberately camp and over the top to go with the type of comedy"
Detective Conan,Think the office on e6 is the same one they used for Jack Donaghy on 30 Rock.
Detective Conan,Conan was so amazing! MORE Conan if there’s a season 2!
Detective Conan,"Watched the first episode with Conan and thought it was incredibly dry and boring, his reactions to the prompts were so [nothing. My](https://nothing.My) partner made me watch the second episode after they watched it by themselves and holy moly did it pickup, rest of the episodes were 10x better."
Detective Conan,"So far it’s not as good as the original. What made murder in successville great was everyone trying to get each other to break and that being left in. They only ever did one take of a scene. This feels polished. I think it’s also lacking because the ridiculousness of the premise is removed. Having all the suspects and victims being Caricatures of celebrities was one of the best things. Having Nikki Minaj, Cheryl Cole, Jay-Z and boris Johnson be suspects in the murder of lady gaga will always be funnier than people you don’t care about. And the actors playing the celebrity suspects broke character and laughed all the time and that made the show, Cariad Lloyd in particular was great. I think the guest detectives are taking it too seriously when they should be pointing out how stupid everything is. It’s not bad at all and I’ve only watched the first two but Murder in Successville had me in stitches multiple times an episode and this hasn’t got a chuckle out of me yet. Will Arnet is great. I hope it gets a series 2 and they stick to the celebrity aspect of the original. It’s good not great and I can’t wait to see Annie Murphy. The hot sauce gag was a great idea with Conan. And his improv was amazing with the senators bit. And that was the funniest moment because the actress broke and laughed. It would be better if there was multiple instances of that per episode. On to episode three.

Edit-
I’m five minutes into Kumails episode and this is already so much better.

Edit- finished the series and they put the two worst episodes first. Ken’s was most like the original and Annie was amazing."
Detective Conan,"Just finished the first episode and I'm kind of on the fence. 

What I like about it so far is the scripted parts are actually pretty funny and the premise is interesting - it's fun trying to solve the murder with the celebrity guest. Will does a great job too - he is very funny!

As a big fan of a different improv show (Thank God You're Here - Aussie version!), it was a bit strange watching improv with such high production. I feel like that took away how much of the other actors' reactions you could see. Part of what makes it funny usually is seeing someone squirm while they think of what to say or when they start to break. I also feel like they didn't give Conan much opportunity to say much, instead they packed all the jokes into Will's character. He's funny, but I feel like that takes the spotlight away from the main guest? Perhaps because the show moved between scenes quickly, the jokes couldn't really be elaborated? 

I don't know... I noticed some of the comments mentioning that they get better with each episode so I'll keep watching anyway. I hope everybody is right!"
Detective Conan,What's your signature sound? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 My daughter and I paused and rewatched the scene 3 times!
Detective Conan,Make a new season and get Bill Burr
Detective Conan,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING 

been a long time since I laughed this hard. Episode 2 is the least funny but shitwagon did a good job none the less.

The rest was just so funny I have to rewatch it later today. 10/10 I really advise to watch it"
Detective Conan,Does anyone else notice that the show is very darkened like physically the video output itself is really dark on my tv screen? No other Netflix shows or etc are like that at all.
Detective Conan,"I posted my thoughts in [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/sk74tp/murderville_on_netflix_is_funny_as_hell/hvoniuc/) thread, but just wanted to reiterate here how amazing this show is, especially if you're a fan of improvised comedy and whodunnits. Legitimately laughed until my sides hurt.

They did a similar concept (except drama) in [My Son](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13234058/trivia/), where everybody was given a script except James McAvoy, who improvised his lines based on what the other actors were doing. (Which was also a remake of another film that did the same thing.)"
Detective Conan,"WARNING - **MASSIVE** SPOILER 

I liked it and really wanted to have fun with the whole ""play along and figure out who did it"", but >!in every single episode the murderer was the second person they interview.!<

I don't understand why they did that? It ruins the ""play along and solve it with us"" aspect. By the end I was only partially paying attention."
Detective Conan,"I made it less than halfway into Conan's episode and had to turn it off. It wasn't funny and was very boring. You'd think with trained comedians and a great premise and freedom to improve it'd at least be interesting.

I watched half of the Marshawn and half of the Annie Murphy episodes. Just not funny. I'm sure it was fun for them to make but it doesn't translate to an audience. Downvote me into oblivion, I don't care. I love comedy and go to improv shows when I'm in Chicago but this just missed the mark."
Detective Conan,"Absolutely awful, as expected. The UK Murder In Successville is just miles better and there shouldn't have been an American remake."
Detective Conan,Why is the acting of Terry’s ex-wife so bad in this?
Detective Conan,As someone who worked on yoville and Farmville games this Ville thing has gone tooo far.
Detective Conan,"I watched the episodes with Conan, Kumail and Ken Jeong. Are any others worth watching???"
Detective Conan,Alright I need them to bring in Colin and Ryan from Whose Line is it Anyway now. Next season wishlist! Lol
Detective Conan,Does anyone know why Will Arnett’s character keeps mentioning Tommy Tutone?  Is Will a big fan or something?  😂
Detective Conan,Watched the first episode and it was funnier than I expected! Conan was amazing. I don’t know how they don’t just fall over with laughter the entire time!
Detective Conan,"Act like you have rubber bands on your arms.

Speak like you're stupid so I look better

It's a quote machine"
Detective Conan,"My wife and I had to pause, pull ourselves together, and replay the Kumail walking scenes several times we were laughing so hard"
Detective Conan,Putting the Conan one first makes it a hard act for everyone else to follow.
Detective Conan,Him talking to the little girl was just brilliant. The fact that neither of them cracked made it even better.
Detective Conan,The look he gave as Will Arnett doused his sloppy sandwich.
Detective Conan,"His ""why I hate magic"" story was the best. You can visibly see Chad's wife from The Righteous Gemstones breaking character during it."
Detective Conan,"I've seen the first three and honestly each one is funnier than the last for me.  
  
Kumail doing his ugly walk with Arnett holding back laughter had me rolling.  
  
Edit: Well, the trend of each being better than the last ended with Annie Murphy's episode. 
 It was funny but for me Kumail and Marshawn were the highlights.  Sharon Stone also really surprised me.  She was on point."
Detective Conan,The best to me was when he comments on Arnette over reacting to the closeup magic
Detective Conan,Conan did a good work >!solving the murder!< too!
Detective Conan,"Good to hear, Conan's episode is the one I'm most looking forward to. Dudes one of the funniest people alive."
Detective Conan,The rest didn’t live up to Conan’s sadly
Detective Conan,"Agreed! My expectations weren't high when I read the synopsis but watched the first episode and I was laughing outloud (which isn't an easy feat to accomplish). The moments where Conan and Will almost broke character, were cherries on top of an already amazing sundae."
Detective Conan,Yea Conan really is a brilliant improv comedian! He’s always SO quick with great jokes
Detective Conan,I must be in the minority because I didn’t find the show funny at all . I thought Conan was trying way too hard to be funny by being off the wall .
Detective Conan,[deleted]
Detective Conan,He walked out into the room at the very beginning like he was walking  out on stage and I’m pretty sure he was honestly expecting applause. At the very least I was expecting applause.
Detective Conan,I want Marshawn and Sharon back as well
Detective Conan,How is Conan improving when everyone else has a script? Or is everyone improving?
Detective Conan,Kumail was so hilarious!
Detective Conan,"Do your best Pakistani accent. But don't be racist. But do your best impression. Without being racist

😂😂😂"
Detective Conan,I was dying at the signature sound.
Detective Conan,"I really liked his episode because he showed true nature by crackling up in most scenes hahaha, it was hilarious"
Detective Conan,">Conan's magic story how he got savagely beaten for 40 minutes by future US senators

Even the woman he was talking to couldn't help laughing lol"
The Last Kingdom,"Respect for them choosing to stick to their plans and actually use the real names of known nobility, rulers, and clergy of the era. 

Mostly I respect that because every third person is named Æthel_____. Any sane production would have subbed 90% of those names out. But they had a roadmap and stuck to it, and it actually worked."
The Last Kingdom,I liked this show very much.
The Last Kingdom,"> underrated

Five seasons and a movie on the way."
The Last Kingdom,"Was pleasantly surprised at how good that series proved to be. Could never get into *Vikings*, which I could never understand because I absolutely **devoured** *Black Sails*, and the two are similar in many ways. Somehow, series like *The Last Kingdom* and *Black Sails* dealt with themes and characters I found more appealing. 

That said, *The Last Kingdom* is **good** from the outset, but personally I believe it doesn't become **great** until the introduction of characters like Finan, and the loyal retinue that slowly begins to form around Uhtred. 

For some reason, I remember thinking that a character like Uhtred and his development would have been a great template for Star Wars in the writing of a character like Anakin Skywalker. The emphasis on identity, on Uhtred's lifelong resentment of having his home and family taken from him, on his development from a solo warrior only interested in his own interests into a leader whose bravery and personality inspires loyalty, and especially how the series handles the tragic love that forms between >!Uhtred and Aethelflaed!<; all while remaining a genuinely funny, likeable person. It's a difficult tonal balance to strike, and I think the series deserves more credit for the fantastic job it does. 

The only real issue (if you can call it that) is how it suffers from *X-Men First Class*\-disorder, with regards to the passage of time and inconsistency of how certain characters age over five seasons. Characters grow old and die, children grow into adulthood, while others never seem to age a day; Uhtred himself lives what feels like several lifetimes, and only appears to have changed stylists (probably because the first one grew old and died)."
The Last Kingdom,They better throw Uthred some grey hair dye for the movie at least.
The Last Kingdom,I love this show. Can't wait for the movie.
The Last Kingdom,"It's full of good characters and one my favorite recent series. I stumbled on it and it had already 4 seasons, then I had the privilege to witness the fifth. Not a single boring episode comes to mind.

Leofric was a obviously a funny character. My favorite however was maybe Alfred for how well he was played. It's been a while so I have forgotten characters no doubt so it's difficult to say who would be a favorite. Beocca has charisma for sure.

Most of the viking characters were interesting as well. Except some female characters I didn't care too much for.

One thing to complain about is the age thing. Gotta just accept it."
The Last Kingdom,[deleted]
The Last Kingdom,"""There's a ransom for your head!""

""I have a very small head""

My favorite line of his."
The Last Kingdom,"It had 5 seasons and a movie coming, I wouldn’t say it’s underrated but it has its *niche*. It’s all great show with some great characters"
The Last Kingdom,"Pretty good, but never understood why Uhtred kept serving the Christian king guy who kept dicking him over at every turn"
The Last Kingdom,second this💯💯
The Last Kingdom,"I loved it until season 5, had to drop it about three episodes in as brida ruined it for me."
The Last Kingdom,Nothing's more satisfying than a main character who does exactly what you want him to do.
The Last Kingdom,Anything that gets people to look into Saint Alfred the Great more is well worth it.
The Last Kingdom,"The first season can be difficult for people to get into, due to how quick the pacing can be, and how many years pass in this season.

The show is absolutely worth it for the drama, and definitely the action. Some of the most fun action scenes in a show. Tense moments and thriller.

Very highly recommend this show. 110% recommend this show."
The Last Kingdom,"Books are great. TV show is worse, with poor main actor casting choice. It's watchable, but not great.

If you want great, watch Andor."
The Last Kingdom,"The show diverges from the books quite a bit by the end, but it is very entertaining and well done. Looking forward to the movie."
The Last Kingdom,"""Only two seasons in""

Lucky you. Season 3 is one of my favorite seasons of anything ever."
The Last Kingdom,I enjoyed it. I still think they (and Cornwell) wasted Æthelflæd.
The Last Kingdom,"Don't have wifi, it was on Syfy channel. The first four seasons which I loved. I hope the Syfy channel will show season 5 also, even at 6:00 in the morning. Please put it on regular TV. Movie too!"
The Last Kingdom,The only Aethel names character I hate so much is Aethelred I hope he dies.
The Last Kingdom,Which characters were your favorites? Hild is such a badass warrior nun!
The Last Kingdom,Father Beocca is one of my favorite character do you have any personal favorites?
The Last Kingdom,Who are your favorite characters?
The Last Kingdom,"Seriously, the actor who played Alfred was awesome. I'd love to see him in more stuff."
The Last Kingdom,"That makes a lot more sense in a world where he's virtually never ""one of you,"" so he's always sort of an outsider even if he's super useful and fairly kind. All in English and from a modern perspective it's a bit more silly, since why would you not want to keep this guy as an ally? He's a main character!"
The Last Kingdom,Is that scene after season 2? I don’t think I remember that scene.
The Last Kingdom,[deleted]
The Last Kingdom,"I lost it when I learned that they title their children who are designated heirs, Ætheling."
The Last Kingdom,Aethelred does some decent things over the course of the show : that's one of the things I like about The Last Kingdom - very few characters are either wholly good or wholly bad.
The Last Kingdom,Baby monk. Actually all of Uthreds boys
The Last Kingdom,Not sure I had a single favorite. Many of the villains were super memorable though!
The Last Kingdom,"Leofric of course.

""Get out here arseling before I crush your irishman!"""
The Last Kingdom,I can't spell most of their names but Uhtred and Father Beoca are definitely up there.
The Last Kingdom,"I haven't watched it in a while, but yeah, I think it's season 4?"
The Last Kingdom,">I think it was his relationship with Alfred that made it as compelling as it was.

Absolutely. 

It's a bit like after >!Athelstan!< died in Vikings. I still enjoyed the show because of Ragnar but their relationship took it to another level for me."
The Last Kingdom,"Yeah, he's a major cunt but at times in battle he's fairly valiant and leads well.

It's not hard to see why he was selected as a potential match for Aethelflaed, he's just a cruel wanker with a seriously fragile ego."
The Last Kingdom,He’s now Aemond Targaryen in House of the Dragon.
The Last Kingdom,Loved him and Uhtreds friendship hated how he dies too early. I did see that he’s credited for a later episode no idea what thats about.
The Last Kingdom,Love Hild and Uhtreds sister and brother relationship!
The Last Kingdom,Holy shit I hadn't made that connection yet! Thats cool
The Last Kingdom,"His death was so, so lame.  I was almost impressed with how lame it was."
The Last Kingdom,Vikings was really good at the start but turned to shit once Ragnar was gone while the last kingdom has pretty steady quality but never hits the highs of the first few seasons of Vikings.
The Last Kingdom,The Last Kingdom. I lost interest in Vikings post Ragnar. I still watched it to the end but it became background noise for me. TLK stayed engaging throughout with the exception of one character who became tiresome.
The Last Kingdom,"That's funny because ""*Deep, ruthless and realistic*"" is exactly how I'd describe TLK.

\+ gritty."
The Last Kingdom,"I prefer Norsemen on Netflix to both, every day of the week and twice on Sunnudagr."
The Last Kingdom,Vikings. I love the characters soo much more.
The Last Kingdom,"The Last Kingdom, great from start to finish hardly any flaws, whilst Vikings was still great it was only really great when >!Ragnar was still on.!<

And Vikings last season really did not do it for me whilst The Last Kingdoms last season was one of the best imo."
The Last Kingdom,S1-2 Vikings > Uhtred son of Uhtred but Vikings falls off a cliff after that point IMO and TLK stays steady.
The Last Kingdom,"vikings after Ragnar became the walking dead after Rick.  

While the last kingdom had a single protagonist and it worked extremely well"
The Last Kingdom,"The Last Kingdom. At least, i didn't see the historical non-sense i saw in Vikings"
The Last Kingdom,The last kingdom because they at least occasionally wore helmets and refrained from depicting the Saxons as total pussys.
The Last Kingdom,The Last Kingdom was good consistently throughout the series. Vikings had some great moments then turned to shit.
The Last Kingdom,"Vikings did a better job with the material and had FAR more compelling characters.  

Last Kingdom every season just feels redundant.  The circumstances change a bit, but the drama basically hits the same beats every season as they build up to the ""big battle"" of the season.  The king (whether its the first king or the young king) listens to bad advice, makes big mistakes, then he finally realizes he should listen to the main guy, then they win, then the king refuses to give the main guy credit for reasons.  

And even though Vikings was the show built around a specific legendary hero, Last Kingdom is the show that basically plots all its characters' motivations around their feelings about the main guy.  Which often makes no sense historically.  Imo, Last Kingdom suffers from severe Poochie syndrome.  ""When Poochie's not on the screen, all the other characters should be asking 'where's Poochie?'"""
The Last Kingdom,"What I want is for The Last Kingdom to have had some of the Vikings production budget/value.

But to answer your question, I definitely enjoyed the Last Kingdom more just because I'm a fan of the books. The dynamic between a dying King Albert and Uhtred is about as big league, poignant a moment(s) as anything I've ever watched.

But I do agree with others, Vikings was just incredible in the beginning couple of years."
The Last Kingdom,[deleted]
The Last Kingdom,I prefer Vikings it’s a little more fun I’d say and Ragnar is an awesome character while he’s in the show.
The Last Kingdom,"Vikings. I was able to finish that at least, I dropped the last Kingdom 2 episodes in to the final season. Brida was annoying as fuck."
The Last Kingdom,love both of them but TLK\`s quest and storyline was closer to me
The Last Kingdom,Vikings was better until a certain character leaves.  the Last Kingdom is a tier below imo although their latest season was much better paced and written than preceding ones imo.  Their budget just shows a bit too much as the production values seem cheap.
The Last Kingdom,"It look me like over a year to get through 4 episodes of the last Kingdom before tapping out, while I immediately fell in love with vikings."
The Last Kingdom,Vikings... Last kingdom is so much cringe drama
The Last Kingdom,"Vikings can be a bit of a mixed bag in the later seasons, but it got more vibes imo. Last Kingdom is kinda tame in comparisson, it never really hooked me so I've dipped out of it."
The Last Kingdom,"They’re different from each other so it’s hard to say.

I would say Vikings was the better looking and better produced show. It felt far more epic.

I liked the focus and story of Last Kingdom more though."
The Last Kingdom,I got really excited until I realised many years ago I watched ‘The 10th Kingdom’ 🥲🥹
The Last Kingdom,"Hm, hard to say but I did watch them one after the other. Loved Vikings but had a really hard time watching the Ivar seasons. I liked the last one with the Russian angle better than the previous ones, but honestly was hate-watching for a while just for the non-Ivar parts.

Last Kingdom, I had a hard time getting through the Alfred and his wife parts iin the first 2 seasons. I definitely enjoyed it a lot more once that faded and it was more about uhtred and his pals riding around on missions.

So, for both I had a radical shift halfway through. Vikings went down, Last Kingdom went up."
The Last Kingdom,Exactly.
The Last Kingdom,"> TLK stayed engaging throughout with the exception of one character who became tiresome.

Brida?"
The Last Kingdom,"True, it wasn't as great post Ragnar. But I still liked the last few seasons with his kids, even though it took a bit of time to start."
The Last Kingdom,too bad it got cancelled
The Last Kingdom,I agree 100% with the take.  It’s like Vikings went from 9/10 to 4/10 while TLK has always been 7-8/10.
The Last Kingdom,lmfao the Poochi reference alone killed me
The Last Kingdom,Tend to agree.  Vikings was taking characters to extremes quite frequently while TLK was a bit more grounded.
The Last Kingdom,What other shows did you enjoy?
The Last Kingdom,yeah the show may not target exactly the same audience. It feels like TLK is a bit more romanced and casual
The Last Kingdom,Yes.
The Last Kingdom,Trailer does not include anyone yelling “SHIELD [long pause] WALL!!”. Deeply concerned.
The Last Kingdom,"Uthred son of Uthred is a great character. 

I am really looking forward to this. In my opinion, this was the best show dealing with Viking theme."
The Last Kingdom,So hyped for more Uhtred son of Uhtred
The Last Kingdom,I am Uhtred son of Uhtred
The Last Kingdom,"Fuck yes.  I finally got around to watching the final season of The Last Kingdom over the past couple of weeks, so it must be... *destiny* that this is coming soon."
The Last Kingdom,"One of my favorite shows of all time, really looking forward to this. Destiny is all!"
The Last Kingdom,Anybody misread the title as Stephen King must die?
The Last Kingdom,"Trailer needed more Finan, but excited nonetheless."
The Last Kingdom,The modern day James Bond. Every season begins or ends with his previous missus dying and him immediately shacking up with a new lady. Be hard pressed to fit that cycle into a 2 hour movie.
The Last Kingdom,"well, that's a lot of kings to assassinate"
The Last Kingdom,"Uthred the Ageless - outlived young Edward.

Pretty hyped tho, ngl"
The Last Kingdom,Best Viking show/movie I’ve ever seen
The Last Kingdom,I was disappointed with the final season but I’m excited to see this
The Last Kingdom,"Also astonishing how many can't read 

Maybe not so surprising in a tv sub tho"
The Last Kingdom,Used to be one of my favorite shows till season 3. But season 4 made me lose all interest and killed my love for it. Did it get any better afterwards?
The Last Kingdom,"Anyone else read the title at first glance as, ""Steven King Must Die""?"
The Last Kingdom,"Anybody else misread the title as ""Buttvirgins #24""?"
The Last Kingdom,"Another one of  the ""everyone in medieval time wore brown or black, even the noble´s, it,s dark and  muddy and whitewash for walls surely is a 21th century invention"" style movies.

This one with a unique new angle of "" i may be wearing a bearskin cloak and a warriors haircut and still can´t afford any nicely made clothes but i just REALLY like expressive eye make up."""
The Last Kingdom,Yes! One of my all time favorites Shows! Destiny is all!
The Last Kingdom,"I read this as Steve King’s Must Die — The Last Kingdom sequel — and was simultaneously confused and excited. I’m a bit let down, but still excited to see Uhtred son of Uhtred."
The Last Kingdom,It is my destiny to watch this.
The Last Kingdom,"I know it's good but I just don't have the time to watch The Last Kingdom. So my question is, do you guys think I can watch this without watching the series? Can the story stand alone?"
The Last Kingdom,"Ahh. 

Was hoping it wouldn't be him vs uthred after rewatch recently..but of course"
Dawn of the Croods,"It's a kids show, I can't imagine why you would expect anything else."
Dawn of the Croods,"I agree, it's terrible. I think I made it through 5 minutes of the first episode"
Dawn of the Croods,"It's baffling how Dreamworks can get stuff like this on Netflix.... and yet Netflix can't get the rights for both HTTYD movies to be on it at the same time. The library doesn't have it, and the nearest rental store is a town over."
Dawn of the Croods,"Bullshit. I enjoy kid's shows, especially the innuendos and subliminal messages. Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls, Dragon Tales, Arthur, Sesame Street, Spongebob, Fairly Odd Parents, Ed Edd & Eddy, Chowder, Pokemon, Yugioh, Loony toons, Pink Panther Cartoons, Tom & Jerry, and many more.

They're so much more clever and subtle than ""adult cartoons"". 

Croods however, made me have a stroke "
Dawn of the Croods,What they only have #2?

Dawn of the Croods,"love that Vought + is a thing, because why not"
Dawn of the Croods,"So, Lamplighter is on the poster at the same time as Starlight, even though she joined the team after he retired?

Come on, Vought, are you even trying with continuity?

Also, lol at A-Train's pose on the poster. He's meant to look fast, but all I see is Tippy-Toes..."
Dawn of the Croods,I love stuff like this. Really makes these fictional universes feel alive!
Dawn of the Croods,"""The Bourke Cut"". Gold."
Dawn of the Croods,"The best part Zack Snyder just qoute tweeted this lmao

https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1527702235429208064?t=vDE6emgcRe02VxH-OMLkvA&s=19

Also the 2 year anniversary the Snyder Cut was announced lol"
Dawn of the Croods,The Bourke Cut. That is amazing lol.  I'm so excited for this season.
Dawn of the Croods,The marketing campaign for this season is top notch.
Dawn of the Croods,"I don’t know if this is for me. Black Noir V Homelander was just not a great film. It was weird to bring in Noir without a solo film first. Superman of America was sort of a good Homelander introduction, but I think they missed what makes Homelander so cool in real life in it. They made him seem a bit dickish. Not chill and heroic like he is really. Now they’re just bringing the whole squad together, again with no solo films. They’re rushing it.

Bourke is a hack. I know some people love him, but I just don’t get his style. They shouldn’t have let him oversee the whole cinematic universe. Black Noir killing people? Give me a break. Everyone knows he’s non-lethal.

The Queen Maeve cartoon slaps though. Love the satirical angle to it."
Dawn of the Croods,"Looks like ""The Bourke Cut"" has changed the plot to make Stormfront the villain in the film's universe? 

If so, that's hilarious."
Dawn of the Croods,Nazi bitch
Dawn of the Croods,"I just finished watching season 2 episode 5 last night, where Maeve is shooting the scene in this trailer. Love how the last scene comes off as a quick rewrite after all the events of season 2."
Dawn of the Croods,"Is it just me, or has Stormfront been digitally removed from the trailer?"
Dawn of the Croods,I kinda wish this was a real movie. i thought it was at first....is it real? i can't tell
Dawn of the Croods,Did they populate the youtube comment section themselves? There's no way that many people gelled on to the joke so quickly.
Dawn of the Croods,So excited for this upcoming season of The Boys.
Dawn of the Croods,Damn they're serious about this. They even made a website for it (as seen at the end of the trailer and the video description): www.dawnoftheseven.com
Dawn of the Croods,"This is incredible. I would love to see this movie.

Also very nice to see Zack acknowledge them!"
Dawn of the Croods,I didn't know the movie from the series is becoming a real movie
Dawn of the Croods,Lol. See they took inspiration from marvels layout design 😂😂
Dawn of the Croods,Uhh… uhh… It’s… ummm… Multiverse!
Dawn of the Croods,The narrators empty phrases remind me of every blockbuster trailer.
Dawn of the Croods,I love their fake Fox News segments they kept uploading every month
Dawn of the Croods,Is that some joke from the show?

Dawn of the Croods,"Can't stand his DC films, but I'm glad to see he can laugh at himself."
Dawn of the Croods,"The A-Train movie ain't ever coming out.
Also, did anyone get real creep vibes from the Deep TV show? He was really unnecessarily handy with those dolphins when he was filming them on that Behind the Scenes thing. Does the Deep fuck dolphins?"
Dawn of the Croods,"Now I wonder what the villain of that movie was originally going to be before Stormfront was exposed as a literal nazi and they made the Seven the heroes against her haha.

I don't remember from the finale of S2, but did the Seven take the credit for Stormfront's death or just say she is on the run?"
Dawn of the Croods,It does appear that reshoots have turned them into the villain of the affair.
Dawn of the Croods,I mean if Amazon likes money they would probably make bank releasing this as a real movie.
Dawn of the Croods,I want them to release this as a full movie with zero mention of The Boys. Fans of the show of course will know and make it known by word of mouth but it will still allow people to come into it without knowing that. Imagine the reactions to completely hammed up Super Hero movie!
Dawn of the Croods,"No, these people are just already in on the joke because that vought channel has been posting shit for awhile"
Dawn of the Croods,"What does ""gelled"" mean in this context?"
Dawn of the Croods,It's not becoming a real movie.
Dawn of the Croods,It's a fake trailer. Like the ones for Tropic Thunder
Dawn of the Croods,That's...that's the joke.
Dawn of the Croods,The Snyder Cut
Dawn of the Croods,Red Letter Media's Jack Quaid?
Dawn of the Croods,"I'm a big fan of his comic book films (a bit more meh on the rest of his stuff) but I think even as much as I can enjoy him as a creative a big part of that is boosted by him being an all-around great guy. He's got an awesome reputation of being amazing to work with and just exudes positivity--which is everything in such a high-stress, cutthroat industry. 

He had a rough couple of years to say the least so I'm glad to see things turned around for him and he's living it up."
Dawn of the Croods,"And yet besides the comic, The Boys has taken many inspirations from Snyder's work on DC than anything else including costume and art designs from his movies."
Dawn of the Croods,[removed]
Dawn of the Croods,Homelander said in a press conference that Stormfront was captured.
Dawn of the Croods,If they could toe the line well enough to mock the superhero movie industry it could be pretty damn hilarious
Dawn of the Croods,"Lmao they should release those ""serious"" Seven movies they mention in-universe. 

It would be hilarious and amazing!"
Dawn of the Croods,"> gelled 

(of a project or idea) take a definite form or begin to work well.
""everything seemed to gel for the magazine"""
Dawn of the Croods,[Are you gellin'?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH1qaDBGUbE)
Dawn of the Croods,It already is. This the Bourke cut version.
Dawn of the Croods,shhh....
Dawn of the Croods,"God, I love me some Tropic Thunder! I remember I went into that movie not having a CLUE what it was about, just randomly went to see it with friends, and it made the experience that much more enjoyable!"
Dawn of the Croods,Maybe…… I get it? Jeez people need to lighten TF up. Lol. Why am I getting down voted because I pointed out an obvious fact? Lol this thread is already giving me weird vibes.
Dawn of the Croods,Oh. I thought Bourke was some character on the show/comics
Dawn of the Croods,Unironically a great guest for RLM. Really got into the nerdy shit while also exhibiting thinly veiled comedy for their despair as the things they loved growing up turned to shit.
Dawn of the Croods,It's one of those weird coincidences like how Spaceballs looks like Star Wars or how Scary Movie looks like Scream
Dawn of the Croods,The boys comic book series lampooned edgy comic book shit so it kinda fits the tv series would stylize itself around Snyder's works.
Dawn of the Croods,Why act so butthurt?
Dawn of the Croods,"Would legitimately make great extra content for Prime too, lol. And I'm sure Sony wouldn't say to no to more spinoffs... after all, they made [this trash.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbius_(film))"
Dawn of the Croods,Maybe I'm dumb but I'm with Raidoton the word doesn't really make sense in that sentence.
Dawn of the Croods,Why can't I find it on IMDb? Does it have another name?
Dawn of the Croods,Bourke is the guy who was pitching Dawn of the Seven in this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzUevujmHLw)
Dawn of the Croods,Snark aside it's kind of interesting they are modeled on DC / Justice League instead of leaning more into Marvel given the relative mindshare right now.
Dawn of the Croods,"I've only watched the first season, but it doesn't really strike me as something that lampoons specifically edgy comic book stuff? Really seems like it's just lampooning broadstrokes comic book stuff and is relatively edgy itself. 

The DCEU parallels just seemed to manifest because The Seven is a Justice League parody, and the DCEU Justice League has been in the zeitgeist while this show has been made so it just seems like the natural thing to riff on."
Dawn of the Croods,"What? No, the Boys lampoons superhero comics as a whole. Garth is not fan superheroes in general. He would lampooning and attacking himself since every comic he produces is considered “edgy“ by Wertham-lite Feige cultists like you."
Dawn of the Croods,"Honestly the comic is more of a satire on celebrity culture in America with a superhero bent, which makes sense I suppose as Garth Ennis did not grow up with Marvel/DC readily available for him to read."
Dawn of the Croods,middle aged

>We gelled as a group, right away."
Dawn of the Croods,its not real its a fake trailer made to promote the tv show the boys. sorry for ruining the fun everyone /lh
Dawn of the Croods,Lol I didn’t know that was Bourke but it definitely makes this little trailer even funnier
Dawn of the Croods,Still can't see that guy as anyone except Bolin from Legend of Korra.
Dawn of the Croods,"You know that the characters are mostly analogous to DC characters, right? 

Homelander is literally a ""What if Superman was a bad guy"" character. You can't very well twist that into any (popular) Marvel character."
Dawn of the Croods,"The Boys satirizes DC and Marvel though. Obviously the characters in the 7 are pretty analogous to Justice League, but the way they are franchised and marketed to be a cultural sensation is very Marvel esque. 

Basically they are parodying characters and archetypes of the DC Universe, while also parodying how Marvel exists in OUR universe"
Dawn of the Croods,"Werham lite feige??

Speak English son."
Dawn of the Croods,"I think it is the ""on to the joke"" part that makes it sound wrong, or at least strange. Just try replacing it with a synonym: ""There's no way that many people [took shape] on the joke so quickly"""
Dawn of the Croods,"Queen Maeve is pretty clearly Wonder Woman, Black Noire is Batman, The Deep is Aquaman, A-Train is The Flash... but then StormFront is inspired by Thor, and possibly Storm, right? Soldier Boy is obviously inspired by Captain America. But otherwise, yeah... And there's an Iron Man analogue who hasn't made it into the show (yet at least.) I'm not sure if Starlight is directly inspired by any one superhero or of she's more of a generic new character"
Dawn of the Croods,"""There's no way that many people [started working together effectively] on the joke so quickly.""

It sounds fine in my head, but you know? In the end, if other people don't like the way it's written, then I failed as a communicator."
Dawn of the Croods,"Stormfront is inspired by Thor and Captain Marvel/Shazam (the DC one). Being made into a female character distorts this a bit I suppose, but that's the basis of the character. 

Starlight is an amalgamation of Doctor Light and Stargirl, both of which are also DC characters. 

Soldier Boy is a Captain America proxy, yes, but he's a minor side character in the source material. At its core The Boys comic is much more of a DC parody than a Marvel one which is one of the main things that's bleeding into the series."
Dawn of the Croods,"To add to the DC parody, Translucent was Jack from Jupiter in the comics. Jack was an analogue to Martian Manhunter, who is typically a part of the 7 main members of the JLA. The person Starlight replaced was also an analogue to Green Lantern as well."
Dawn of the Croods,">And there's an Iron Man analogue who hasn't made it into the show (yet at least.)

Tek knight is a batman+iron man parody,"
Dawn of the Croods,"In the comic, Black Noire is definitely *not* Batman; there's a separate character filling that role (Tek Knight?), and Noire's sort of weird unknown that doesn't have a clear analogue.  Haven't seen the show, but don't they also start with a member of the 7 whose power is he turns invisible? Not sure who that's supposed to be inspired by."
Dawn of the Croods,"Yeah even that doesn't sound right to me. Like if hear ""working on the joke"" to me it sounds like they are trying to write a joke. Working on the material. Seems like you meant more along the lines of ""playing off the joke.""

Yeah ""gelled off the joke""...maybe that is better? Not sure but yeah I'm in the same boat maybe it is just wrong in my head. I'm no English expert."
Dawn of the Croods,"That's interesting. It makes sense, since the Justice League/DC characters were more popular and recognizable at the time than any Marvel characters outside of Spider-Man... and also tend to be depicted as more pseudo-godlike than Marvel characters, even the ones who are literally gods."
Dawn of the Croods,Indeed. It was also published by DC at the beginning.
Dawn of the Croods,"The comics also have a whole parody of the X-Men, and Stormfront’s comic team is a reference to the Avengers."
Dawn of the Croods,"I'd say Black Noire is more Batman than Tek Knight. Tek Knight has Batman elements, but given he uses power armour and is on a team called The Revengers that are full of other Marvel parodies, I'd classify him closer to Iron Man using the Batman elements that weren't baked into Black Noire. The invisible guy on the Seven is a show thing, the comics had Jack from Jupiter, a Martian Manhunter stand in, and Lamp Lighter, very obviously based off Green Lantern."
Dawn of the Croods,"""Gelled onto the joke"" sounds better to me than ""gelled off the joke""; the former would at least makes sense from context; the latter just sounds like nonsense."
Dawn of the Croods,"I disagree. Latter sounds like the joke is how the people gelled. Now that I'm looking at this again maybe over is the better word there. You know like ""We bonded over our similar experiences"" You bonded because of the experiences, not *onto* the experiences that doesn't really make sense. 

To me ""We bonded off of our similar experiences"" works too but maybe that is just more of a regional thing. Language is an interesting thing."
Dawn of the Croods,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
Dawn of the Croods,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
Dawn of the Croods,[removed]
Dawn of the Croods,[removed]
Dawn of the Croods," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
Dawn of the Croods,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.

F Is for Family,57 is pretty young to go.
F Is for Family,"I’m 32, my best friend died of an accidental overdose two days before my 30th bday. It’s rough, definitely still miss him."
F Is for Family,"I mean... this guy was 57. I don't know if that's ""that"" age. Unless it is now because COVID."
F Is for Family,"As someone who is 37 and has had to be intimately aware of their own mortality since they were 8 years old - I believe It's important for people to come to terms with it and spend time often thinking about it. Not dwelling, but considering the finite nature of our existence.

I've always considered human life to be a large flowing river. Each individual gets an opportunity to ride the river for a short time. If you extend your perspective to view the entirety of human existence, that's a lot of leaves floating and sinking, seemingly over very short distances. You are a prt of that river. One leaf in a long and flowing course. Yours rose and it will sink just like everyone else, your daughters rose and hers will float and eventually sink. 

In 200 years nobody will know you ever existed. Just as you (likely) have no idea who your great great grandfather was, what he did, what his interested were or what he thought about. Some might find this disturbing or dark - but its simply a fact of life. Some might spend their time wondering how to impart their memory on their loved ones to carry it further along the river for as far as possible - but really, when you consider the long course of the river, how many billions of leaves have risen and sank - to what end is this desire? Other than to preserve our ego."
F Is for Family,I mean 57 is very young to die.
F Is for Family,It doesn’t really start seriously until you’re in your 60s
F Is for Family,"That's why I don't have any friends.

\*taps forehead*"
F Is for Family,I remember Bill said on a podcast once he has a list of all his friends that have passed away and it’s over 50 people.
F Is for Family,I’m 37 and think about mortality a lot too.
F Is for Family,"I have a lot of anxiety around death and am 36. I get panicky because ""I'm almost to the age I could just drop dead suddenly from a heart issue like John Hughes"" but it's also still a ways away honestly.

The craziest part that feeds into my fear now is on one side of my family, my grandparents lived into their 80s - grandpa died of heart failure at like 85, and grandma died of Covid but had lots of underlying conditions as well, at around the same age. Not bad!

On my other side of the family, I've known nothing. Total blank. Never knew my father or his family or history. My adopted dad said casually over the holiday break that ""oh yeah, your grandpa on that side dropped dead at 52 from a sudden heart attack"". Great, awesome. Turns out he also smoked like a chimney and had had several strokes prior.

STILL."
F Is for Family,"My grandfather used to say, “When you get to be my age, all you do is go to funerals.” It’s depressing, but he made it through WW2 and lived until his early-90s, so I feel like he got everything he could out of life."

I mean one of my people I graduated high school with died like the year after we graduated, but I wasn't friends with him and he had some kind of crazy health conditions anyway (also he was so mean)."

F Is for Family,57 is an early age to die by today's standards
F Is for Family,"My father's lost a number of people he grew up with. He's in his early 60s.

Sometimes it makes sense. Peoples habits catching up with them. Sometimes it doesn't - accidents, genetic conditions, even sometimes just straight up shocking heart attacks or strokes or whatever. 57 is definitely a young age to die, but it's not shockingly young.

Still tragic, though."
F Is for Family,"There are specific guided meditations on death that people can use to help think about this too. 
  
A while back I heard an episode of a meditation podcast (10% happier) talking about this and interviewing a meditation teacher who specialized in this area. It was pretty neat."
F Is for Family,"I hope it's not bothering you. If so, you have to get out there and distract yourself. No sense in worrying about things you can't possibly change."
F Is for Family,"I'm the same age and ever since my mother died of pancreatic cancer a year ago I frequently have anxiety over my own mortality; sometimes it literally wakes me up from sleep. On my mom's side cancer is a thing, taking my grandmother and some of her siblings as well. 

On my dad's side however, I have an aunt and uncle who are 85 and 80 respectively and don't look a day over 65. My paternal grandma was mid-80s when she passed and her sister, my great-aunt lived to 98. I have no idea where the pendulum will swing for me and I wish I could just not think about this so often. I really want to live to a ripe old age but I'm so worried about being at higher risk for cancer. It's also something that's so hard to talk about IRL with others because of the topic. I wish I knew how to deal."
F Is for Family,Which is even more disappointing cause Eddie Murphy only voiced his character for like half the show.
F Is for Family,I’m almost impressed by the conviction with which you present an entirely subjective opinion.  Almost.
F Is for Family,From this show
F Is for Family,RIP Dustin Diamond
F Is for Family,"They don't care. Most will never care until it hits them personally, and others never will at all. ""Individual liberties"" bullshit."
F Is for Family,They don't work anyway
F Is for Family,"They are an easy target and people love to scapegoat, but the reality is that all those 'essential' personnel, all those 'essential' businesses, all that distance theater people engage in have far *far* more impact than a few people not wearing their masks.

That's before even getting into those warehouse parties they are breaking up in NYC with thousands of people, or those hopping on planes for cheap vacations.

Not wearing your mask is dumb, but wearing it doesn't make everything else suddenly ok either."
F Is for Family,Winning what?
Making a Murderer,Sounds like hype for a new series to me
Making a Murderer,"Yup, he should have just ignored it."
Making a Murderer,I hope this means that Netflix will make more original sci-fi shows
Making a Murderer,Its because it has DnD in it. Chicks fucking love DnD.
Making a Murderer,I don't think I've ever started a show with such checked expectations and been absolutely blown away so quickly. Stranger Things is just so ridiculously entertaining.
Making a Murderer,"No one gives a fuck about Barb, not even her own mom!



"
Making a Murderer,"It deserves the acclaim. I remember seeing the promo banner and thinking it might be an ok scifi show so maybe I would watch an episode. I watched the entire thing through in one sitting. It's soooo good. 
  
edit: just wanted to add that my favorite scene (no spoilers) is when she flips the board over, really good way of conveying the idea to the audience."
Making a Murderer,How does Digital Spy get these numbers? I thought Netflix doesn't release their ratings.
Making a Murderer,Netflix having hit after hit is spelling doom for the cable companies
Making a Murderer,Has more front page posts on Reddit than Daredevil and Making a Murderer did!
Making a Murderer,"""You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to.""

Edit: a lot of people seem to be missing that this is a quote from Jonathan."
Making a Murderer,"My father is retired and had all the time in the world to watch whatever he wants , anything I describe he always shrugs it off and never watched it . He accidently let the auto play on when he was browsing and hot super into it , I ain't even mad .. He connected with it because he said it reminded him of older mystery shows."
Making a Murderer,I really like the sheriff's character in this show...develops well.
Making a Murderer,Honestly I think theses shows are becoming popular because they find no name actresses and actors who actually have talent. Im sick of seeing the same damn shitty people all the time! 
Making a Murderer,"It's got really wide appeal. Daredevil and Jessica Jones are both great, but at the end of the day, not everyone wants to dedicate 12 hours to a superhero show.  
  
Stranger Things wasn't a huge time investment and it had such a great aesthetic and characters that it really appeals to a lot of people.  
My parents rarely watch more than an hour or so of TV a night, but they saw the first episode and finished the entire thing the next day."
Making a Murderer,"The whole cast nails it but especially the girl who plays Eleven, she carried that show for me. So talented! The ending really got to me"
Making a Murderer,The fact that this show was rejected by so many networks proves how far TV exec's have their heads up their collective asses.
Making a Murderer,Stupid question - what age is this appropriate for?
Making a Murderer,Still mad Barb got the shit end of the stick. #teambarb 
Making a Murderer,"If I'm not very into Thrillers or Suspense, will I still like this show? It seems like that's the targeted genre/audience, right?"
Making a Murderer,"I just finished S01E04 and I'm really enjoying the show. I think I've figured out the shows personality... it's like a cross between the X-Files and that 80's movie ""The Goonies""  .... It's been very entertaining so far."

Making a Murderer,"Well-deserved. It's the best Netflix original as well as one of the most purely entertaining shows I've seen in quite some time. The way it uses its 80s narrative mechanics, themes and aesthetics and turns it into a suspenseful, emotionally powerful drama rather than a pastiche is really impressive.

Millie Bobby Brown for president! "
Making a Murderer,"I liked it but think it's being a tad overrated. My main problem is it borrowed well but didn't have enough original ideas. Everything felt pulled from somewhere else. Also the monster was uninteresting. Great characters and tone, I just wish it had something original to say as well. "
Making a Murderer,"It's because it's better story-telling than those two shows.  It's not as muddled up.  It's this one primary story and everything in the show is related to that story, the episodes move at an almost perfect pace, each advancing the story just enough."
Making a Murderer,Eleven and Mike were so fucking cute. Anybody got another good show to watch?
Making a Murderer,"I feel almost bad asking but am I the only one who wasn't blown away by this show? I mean it was good, obviously, but not amazing. However, I didn't binge it. Think I did it over a week here and there. I'm tempted to rewatch it because one of the things that put me off was the scare factor. I hate cheap jump scares and a couple times an episode it kept playing that shit.. Every time I was getting engrossed I'd have to do that thing where I kinda half look away so it didn't make me jump. Kept taking me out of the show. And I was disappointed with the monster. I wanted aliens, man. "
Making a Murderer,"I hate horror (I'm a giant baby) but i loved this show, the references were so organic and non detracting. I never played dnd in my life but not once did i feel like pausing the episode serching shit up because simply through their reactions I was able to understand.

Also loved how they subverted the ""boyfriend is a jerk, fellnin love with my stalker"" trope, felt refreshing as hell.

Also i felt heavy scp foundation vibes!
"
Making a Murderer,"expect tv executives to take away the wrong lessons from this and rush out their own poorly made 80's sci fi tv shows in an attempt to cash in on this rather than making well made, well planned, well executed labor of loves."
Making a Murderer,"I woke up today thought, damn /r/television could **really** use *yet* *another* thread about 'Stranger things'

And well what do you know? the universe provided"
Making a Murderer,"The problem with Making a Murderer is that I can read the entire thing on Wikipedia in 10 minutes. The episodes are far too long, and my wife and I gave up by the time the police railroaded that poor high school kid into confessing.

Stranger Things drew us in from the first episode. it's fantastic."
Making a Murderer,I'm just glad all TV isn't at Stranger Things level of quality...I'd turn into a literal couch potato.
Making a Murderer,Rewatching it. There is a great scene-by-scene analysis of all the parallels it has with all the great 80s movies out there. Sorry can't link. 
Making a Murderer,"It's a really great show, but it did feel a little rushed towards the end with characters just figuring things out pretty easily. I'm trying to decide if that's also an 80s thing, or just because of the constraints of the episode limit."
Making a Murderer,The character development makes it for me. The show is perfect. 
Making a Murderer,"It may not be a show *for* kids, but it's a show that kids *can* watch. That might have something to do with it. "
Making a Murderer,"It was really good. My favorite is probably Jessica Jones, but this is my 2nd"
Making a Murderer,Oh man why haven't I watched this? I need to see this before the semester starts for me.
Making a Murderer,"I watched the show with no expectations but it's just sooooooo good. The writing, the characters, the suspense, this show has got me hyped af for season two!"
Making a Murderer,"I'll start a ""stranger things"" watch marathon in one hour, heard so much about it, hope I will not waste my time!"
Making a Murderer,There is a media blitz occurring with this show. Just heard an NPR story about it this morning as well. Something tells me that there is a bit of an Advertorial going on here. I'm incredibly pessimistic so maybe I'm just being paranoid. 
Making a Murderer,This show was good but this sub is sucking on it like gold is going to come out of its cock. 
Making a Murderer,This is one of the few shows that absolutely lives up to its hype. 
Making a Murderer,"I mean its not The Wire, or Breaking Bad, but it is very good at what it is.  A nice unexpected sci-fi/horror 80s setting without too many frills.  Solid acting, especially from the kids (which often suck).  I can see where if you were told it was *amazing* you might be disappointed, but it is pretty strong.  Knowing nothing going in I thought it was amazing, but expectations play such a huge role in how much people enjoy stuff.

Its one of the main reason I tend to be meh about the comic book movies.  People sell them to me as so great, and they are basically 80s action flicks with spandex for 12 year olds.  I am not sure any of them would make my top 20 most years, maybe GotG and Deadpool, that is it."
Making a Murderer,"I don't know why, but there's something just incredibly likable about it. It's not your typical horror and it's not you're typical sci-fi, and alongside that it really has some strong emotional elements about family and friendship that work well. To top it off, the cast - literally everyone in the series - is fantastic. 

I can't say I've been super crazy about most of Netflix's original content, but I think this show was a risk that paid off."
Making a Murderer,The fact the creators had so much trouble getting this thing made goes to show you how out of touch the major networks are...
Making a Murderer,Season 2 of daredevil was a disappointment
Making a Murderer,[removed]
Making a Murderer,"Still on episode 2.   


What am I missing? Still feels pretty meh to me. "
Making a Murderer,Frustrated by Netflix's unwillingness to reveal the true ratings ... but this show seems to have captured everyone I know by the scruff of their necks.
Making a Murderer,Going forward I would like Stranger Things to be an anthology and just tell a brand new story every season. 
Making a Murderer,"Wtf are people seeing in this show...

It's good but not great.  The more I read about it, the more I feel like I'm in the fucking Twilight Zone.  Seriously,  what is the big deal?   Ugh...this shouldn't be upsetting me the way it is but WHY are we circle jerking for this slightly above average show?"
Making a Murderer,Watched first two episodes. Haven't had any interest in picking it back up again. 
Making a Murderer,"I really didn't like the show or understood what all the fuss was about. There i said it, now i'll get ready for all the downvotes"
Making a Murderer,It wouldn't be /r/television without a top post praising Netflix's latest streaming show on the front page every day for 2 months!
Making a Murderer,"Can someone tell me what was so great about this show? Seeing so much hype around it. I watched it, it was ok. I liked it for sure, but I don't really get what the big deal about it is.

It reminded me a lot of that movie Super 8. I thought Hopper was a great and interesting character but other than that nothing really jumped out at me. I thought Daredevil was much better."
Making a Murderer,"Just finished it last night.  I have to say as much as I liked it, I felt disappointed.  Some of that has to do with hype.  Everyone was saying how much they liked it so I was expecting a complete well explained story.  Also, part of my interest in the story was to have the stranger things explained, that never really happened and it leaves you with more questions than answers. "
Making a Murderer,It's because it was good and fairly universal and family friendly
Making a Murderer,"It was good and it had a X-Files feel to it.  But I felt they answered too many questions, too early.  And then left questions still open.  The pacing seemed off.

**Spoilers**

For example, they we find out about the lost kid by the end of the season and everything is OK.  The bad guys seemed to have all died.  And we still don't know where that ugly CGI alien came from."
Making a Murderer,[deleted]
Making a Murderer,The data they are using isn't from Netflix. it's from a company that tries to use the ratings to determine popularity. That's a terrible metric to judge popularity.
Making a Murderer,"So scared to read anything about it in case of spoilers. I think I'm around 5 or 6 episodes in. I watch it with my boys who are the same age as the main kids, who are the same age I was in 1983. "
Making a Murderer,"If 80's nostalgia is what wins audiences, then when *Ready Player One* movie comes out in 2018 people are going to freak."
Making a Murderer,No one is going to mention how awesome David Harbour was in this?
Making a Murderer,"Just finished the last episode last night. Can honestly say I have never felt so many emotions throughout each episode. From smiling, to tears, to laughing, to holding my breath in anticipation and looping back around again before the end credits start. Stranger Things, in my opinion, is the greatest show to come out in a long time. "
Making a Murderer,"No shit, it's epic."
Making a Murderer,I think i would've lost interest if there were commercial breaks and slow release episodes.  Being able to marathon it all it once kept me on the edge of my seat.
Making a Murderer,"Goonies, ET, Silver Bullet, The Explorers, Fire starter, Poltergeist."
Making a Murderer,"Netflix is becoming like Motown, just hit after hit."
Making a Murderer,If I didnt start watching this show I would feel like such a dumb idiot
Making a Murderer,"I love the acting! Winona, the kids.. Hats off to the casting directors. If there isn't some sort of awards ceremony where this show cleans up.... Insane. I also love how the show doesn't spell things out to the audience. Brilliant show. Really feels like you're watching a genuine movie made in the 80s. Love it! "
Making a Murderer,Kinda reminds me of Beyond: Two Souls
Making a Murderer,So far it's the only Netflix show I've watched along with my parents and sister. The show is just so accessible to a broad audience. Compelling and sophisticated enough for adults. Entertaining and relatable enough for teens. The show is an achievement in television.
Making a Murderer,It was perfect.
Making a Murderer,"The way they portray the 80's is spot on. This is one of the only shows that is shot in present day that takes place in the 80's that captures the time period perfectly, it's not just the feeling of nostalgia that people get when watching it, but the writing and the story are phenomenal on top of that, they nailed literally every single aspect perfectly."
Making a Murderer,The music is amazing. 
Making a Murderer,Cable TV is dead
Making a Murderer,"I heard everyone rave about it, and last night I started episode one and was blown away. I watched the first five and finally tore myself away at 3:30 a.m. to get some sleep before work. Cannot wait to finish. 

Everything is so well done, from the writing to the music to the cinematography, and it honestly makes me nostalgic for a decade I am frankly a little too young to actually remember. "
Making a Murderer,"I just don't get this. I watched the first episode and thought... ""Meh."" I watched the second to give it another chance... ""More meh."" It's a mash up of something like three Spielberg films. There's nothing original about it at all.

It's a throwback to the 1980s, which is intentional... but all the stuff that's supposed to be cool about it was new and cool in the 1980s. Now... it's all TV trope stuff.

Maybe that's the key. All that's old is new again.

I love Man in the High Castle, the Marvel shows on Netflix (Daredevil season 2 wasn't as good as season 1, but still good), Mr. Robot, The Americans... there's lots of great original television out there right now. I'm a scifi fan from way back, I love haunted house/ghost/creepy movies... I should love this show.

Except that I've seen all of it before, and that bores me."
Making a Murderer,Also made me cry like a baby
Making a Murderer,"Amazing show. Besides a wonderfully cast group of actors and nailed 80's nostalgia, I really think a major part of the success rests in clear but complex story telling and length. Watching through it, the pacing didn't have that arduous slow pace that cable tv does. Stranger things is to the point and quick about it and the pay off scenes come quickly and in number. 

You don't have to wait a very long time before you see the big story points and I think that is largely due to the 8 episode limit which allows the story to breathe like a movie instead of a beaten and bloodied tv show where, by the end of it, you are practically screaming on the couch because of how slow and stupid the character are for not getting what is going on. Great show and I hope more shows follow the same pattern."
Making a Murderer,"It didn't take long for the first half of this thread to (d)evolve into an abstract on DnD.

Also, just really can't say enough about this show. The advantages of formatting a story as a streaming series versus a feature film, that have been made readily apparent already, are on full display in Stranger Things and the execution is effortless.

I would love to see more film-makers, writers, etc using this format for projects with a scope that are really just too large to be done correctly in any other medium"
Making a Murderer,The first episode did nothing for me.    Does it get MUCH better?? 
Making a Murderer,"I swear to god, if I pull this up on Netflix and find out it's popular because it's fucking stupid I'm dedicating my life to email spam.

"
Making a Murderer,"Every time I see an Eggos at the store, I think of Eleven and then I'm sad "
Making a Murderer,IT's D&D.
Making a Murderer,"A big thanks to r/SCP for tipping me off to this amazing show!
"
Making a Murderer,"This may be one of the best shows I've seen in years. A true period piece, not a single dull character, painfully potent nostalgia, great music and atmosphere, etc. Just magic all around. "
Making a Murderer,What's the show about? Ive been hearing the name a lot lately 
Making a Murderer,"The first week of the release, Reddit was buzzing with talk with the show. This only lead to me watching the show and being completely obsessed and telling almost all of my current friends I hang out with. Now these past few weeks, I sit and try not to spoil the show as more and more friends catch on. Such is the life of a redditor."
Making a Murderer,"I really enjoyed this show, the atmosphere is so fucking good! Great actors to pull of some intense characters and scenes. Favorite scene was ""R-U-N"". "
Making a Murderer,"Honestly all the great nods to classic 80s movies aren't even what make this great.  The story is awesome, and the characters are all compelling.  I think being set in the 80s also makes it all feel more simple and real.  No cell phones or anything, it just tugs at the nostalgia strings of my childhood"
Making a Murderer,Is this an advertisement for Netflix or something?
Making a Murderer,The hype around this fucking show is nauseating.
Making a Murderer,"How the hell is Fuller House the most popular show on Netflix? That shit was garbage. Couldn't make it past the first five minutes of the first episode. And this is coming from someone that loved the original series. Sure, it's dated, but it was decent. "
Making a Murderer,"We fucking know it's a hit, it's got pointless articles here every damn day adding nothing new to the discussion"
Making a Murderer,Listening to the soundtrack as I read this lol it's so good
Making a Murderer,"Its amazing how ""meh"" the critical reception was, but this show just exploded anyway.

I remember reading only one review that got it right. The cliches that would've made it bad only helped the show's charm. It truly did travel you back in time when this kind of thing was popular."
Making a Murderer,"I feel like people are just circle-jerking now. It's a good show, but seriously it's not **that** good."
Lupin the Third Part I,So we've reached Lupin the III?
Lupin the Third Part I,Elaborate heists please and less family woes
Lupin the Third Part I,I really like this show. Omar Sy is great. He should have had a bigger role in the Jurassic movies.
Lupin the Third Part I,"Happy part 3 will be out soon, helps me brush up on my french a little bit. Very good show imo."
Lupin the Third Part I,Can't wait...
Lupin the Third Part I,These Netflix adaptions are really getting out of hand.
Lupin the Third Part I,Same
Lupin the Third Part I,"I obsessively loved Part IV. Then Part V was good, but didn't scratch the itch the same way. To me, the beauty of Part IV was how intensely it committed to its out-of-time retrofuturism, creating an Italy that was both futuristic, modern and still rooted in the 1960s Italian New Wave. I'd never seen a setting that densely lived-in and chic in an anime before. I thought it was the whole ethos of Lupin, but they've been trying other things too that haven't gripped me as much."
Lupin the Third Part I,WHERE IS UZUMAKI TOONAMI!
Lupin the Third Part I,What they should do is air the Mine Fujiko series. Thatd enamor a whole new generation with this world.
Lupin the Third Part I,"I've heard about Lupin and I wa t to have a watch, bitbis there anywhere to find it in the UK? 

Can't see it on any of the streaming services we've got, and I'm not a massive TV watcher, so I'm not really going out the way just for one show."
Lupin the Third Part I,Finally!
Lupin the Third Part I,Yo
Lupin the Third Part I,Part 5 was pretty hit and miss for me but still going to watch this at some point. Hopefully it comes to Hulu or Netflix in the near future.
Lupin the Third Part I,"Wait, Lupin III is still running? I saw those movies 20+ years ago on tv and still remember the hermaprodite Nazi they had as the villain in one of them."
Lupin the Third Part I,This title does not understand tense at ALL
Lupin the Third Part I,Lame
Lupin the Third Part I,Felt the same way for Grave of Daisuke Jigen and Bloodspray of Goemon Ishikawa OVAs. I feel like  Lupin III works really well when not being someplace specifically modern.
Lupin the Third Part I,"so weird, I loved part V way more than part IV

Im just glad we're getting constant new series though"
Lupin the Third Part I,Are they self contained? I'd love to jump into Lupin. I've only seen the Miyazaki movie agees ago
Lupin the Third Part I,It will be released in october 2022
Lupin the Third Part I,"Every time we ask for it, it gets delayed another quarter."
Lupin the Third Part I,"Oh certainly, Fuji-cakes brings ALL the boys to the yard!"
Lupin the Third Part I,I  don't know if anyone has the streaming rights to Lupin in the UK. Maybe Crunchyroll?
Lupin the Third Part I,Are the other parts on Hulu?
Lupin the Third Part I,You'll feel the same about VI
Lupin the Third Part I,"Naw, it's a common tense to write headlines in (as confusing as that might be)"
Lupin the Third Part I,Yeah. Each season is almost if not totally self-contained.
Lupin the Third Part I,No. The different parts are scattered over different streaming services or you seem to be able watch most of it on crunchyroll for free with ads if you don't want to to purchase a subscription.
Lupin the Third Part I,"It’s really not. Those articles are written at a different relative time to their content, or, they’re wrong too."
Lupin the Third Part I,How's the dub do you know? And what do you recommend watching
Lupin the Third Part I,Cheers thanks
Lupin the Third Part I,The dub for Part IV is absolutely stellar. I prefer it over the sub. Tony Oliver and Richard Epcar are perfect as Lupin and Jigen.
Lupin the Third Part I,I think the whole cast for the dub is great.
Lupin the Third Part I,"Cool! I'll look into watching the Fujimiko series, and part 4 and 5. 

Wasn't there a neat looking CGI movie? Was that any good?"
Lupin the Third Part I,Richard Epcar just killing it these days
Lupin the Third Part I,The CGI movie was fantastic. Great animation all over that nailed the personality of the series and an extremely good and contained Lupin story to go with it.
Lupin the Third Part I,The Fujimiko series might be some of the best anime Ive ever watched
Lupin the Third Part I,HBO to Naughty Dog: “ima need you to make a third game or we’ll write our own part three”
Lupin the Third Part I,But did you know that diarrhea is hereditary?
Lupin the Third Part I,Roughly 20% growth episode on episode is insane. These numbers are insane
Lupin the Third Part I,Execs everywhere now combing over every video game ever
Lupin the Third Part I,I’ve been loving this show so much. I’m so glad someone who actually cares for the source material is making this show.
Lupin the Third Part I,should hopefully keep steady til final.
Lupin the Third Part I,"How do the ratings compare between Friday and Sunday nights in the US? I know there are games on other channels on Sunday, but aren't a lot of people out on a Friday night?"
Lupin the Third Part I,"Crazy thing about well made shows: people watch them. 

Together we can stop shitty entertainment, but we need to work together on this people"
Lupin the Third Part I,"Said it the the second week, I'll say it again

Season finale will have HOTD finale numbers, 10+M."
Lupin the Third Part I,Well it helps that the show is really good. Not many shows live up to the hype this had. As a Halo fan I gave up on the show. I’m sure the relative loyalty of the source is retaining fans.
Lupin the Third Part I,Aw the IMDB review bombing is working real well
Lupin the Third Part I,[deleted]
Lupin the Third Part I,"The more I enjoy this great show, the sadder I feel about how they absolutely butchered the Witcher and the Wheel of Time..."
Lupin the Third Part I,This show is absolutely killing it!
Lupin the Third Part I,"i have not been a hype man for this show at all and i gotta say it's the best videogame adaptation that i know of. typical HBO quality in regards to everything. every episode has been solid and last week's was phenomenal and reminded me of what the walking dead could have been if it was on HBO.

if they push this to two or three seasons by adapting the second game i can totally see it becoming an all-timer for the network. the people making this show know what they're doing."
Lupin the Third Part I,"recipe to success is very simple

\- simple story

\- complex characters"
Lupin the Third Part I,Have they mentioned whether season 1 is the full game? Because already episode 5…meaning only 4 hours left of story which blows my mind.
Lupin the Third Part I,"**It's the behemoth that keeps on growing:**

>Episode 4 of *THE LAST OF US* delivered another series high Sunday night, with 7.5 million viewers across HBO Max and linear telecasts. Viewership was up 17% from Episode 3 last Sunday and 60% above the series debut night in January. Viewing is based on Nielsen and first party data. The series has grown its audience each Sunday night with the release of new episodes."
Lupin the Third Part I,cant stop the pedro train
Lupin the Third Part I,Season 2 is going to be off the hook.
Lupin the Third Part I,Not that surprising consider this is its first week without NFL playoffs.
Lupin the Third Part I,"I'm one of the people who helped it grow this weekend.  We hadn't checked it out yet, but I kept hearing so much good feedback about the 3rd episode that I finally decided to check the show out.  My wife and I watched the first episode Friday night and were instantly hooked.  What a well written, directed and acted show so far.

The 3rd episode was a masterpiece, imo.  I've never been so emotionally invested in a pair of one-off characters before.  My wife had tears in her eyes for half the episode.  Not going to elaborate to avoid spoilers.  

Only 4 episodes so far, but no clunkers and no filler.  If it keeps up this pace, it will be my favorite new show since The Expanse."
Lupin the Third Part I,"Oh, so you mean all the right wing backlash because episode three had some gay dudes in it amounted to nothing?

Shocker.

These people might be loud assholes, but they’re the minority and they’re slowly being relegated to the sad pages of history."
Lupin the Third Part I,A truly impressive video game to TV series adaptation so far. They deviate from the source material when it makes for a better story and I'm here for it
Lupin the Third Part I,"You know what?  Good for everyone involved.  When people make a good product to tell a good story everybody wins.  I'm looking forward to the season closing out so I can watch it all in one go and I'll do the same in the second season, too."
Lupin the Third Part I,"I love how terminally online bigots said it would drop like crazy after the third episode and then this happens. Like even I expected a slight drop, but it didn't come. This is absolutely insane."
Lupin the Third Part I,Surely this can’t be true. A bunch of people online told me that HBO pushing their woke agenda in Ep. 3 was going to kill the show??
Lupin the Third Part I,maybe an unpopular opinion but i felt Ep. 4 was the best one so far. only wish it was longer. great character development in this one and still some cool action scenes
Lupin the Third Part I,This is easily one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.
Lupin the Third Part I,"The creative talent behind this show is off the chain. Craig Mazin has done a tremendous job adapting the source material and building upon an already incredible story. The casting across the board has been A+. The decision to have Peter Hoar direct Ep.3 was a stroke of genius, with his previous work on It's a Sin making total sense. Just goes to show what can happen when talented people are passionate about a project and given the means to see their vision come about."
Lupin the Third Part I,"And this is in spite of half of Canadians being left unable to watch it for a couple of hours because our telecom company, bell, is garbage."
Lupin the Third Part I,Praise Druckmann. The man is just on a roll every week with the amazing episodes
Lupin the Third Part I,Dad jokes delivered!
Lupin the Third Part I,"It's amazing what can be achieved when they create a show that is faithful to the spirit of the source material, rather than trying to make wholesale changes in an almost condescending fashion. No one cares about a particular writer or directors idea for how to reimagine a beloved IP just for the sake of making it their own. The audience want the IP. They want what makes that series great.

I don't want an Assassin's Creed movie where the dude is jumping around in some virtual room for example instead of going into the animus as you do in every single game. What the fuck was that even? They completely missed what mattered"
Lupin the Third Part I,I have been doing my part to get as many people into it as possible haha
Lupin the Third Part I,"Pedro Pascal seems like a magnet to drawing viewers. GoT, Mandalorian, Last of Us he’s doing great"
Lupin the Third Part I,This almost guarantees a third last of us game and probably a 3rd season of the show also.
Lupin the Third Part I,Good show
Lupin the Third Part I,They can easily stretch part 2 into 2 seasons
Lupin the Third Part I,"Everyone and their mother is on this.

Which is great, it's a good story and they're doing a good job since they care.

Thing is that the game is cinematic on its own, and I'm glad new people are exposed to it (which was definitely one of the goals) but don't forget, It isn't totally new. So, I'm glad the adaptation is good but the story existed in the last 10 years at this point.

I guess this main stream we-discovered-something-amazing all of a sudden, kinda bugs me, I dunno."
Lupin the Third Part I,But but but woke broke or w/e!?
Lupin the Third Part I,I think ep4 was pretty mild compared to ep3. So I wonder if that surge will continue.
Lupin the Third Part I,"Last episode was okay, first three were huge."
Lupin the Third Part I,"It's so good. Not to harp on that dead horse velma, but when the wife and I decided to catch up on last of us..we had to get through three velma promotions to find it in the search bar. They're really advertising that sucker hard in front of last of us"
Lupin the Third Part I,"While this news is exciting, the last episode was the least entertaining so far."
Lupin the Third Part I,I must be the only person who felt that the show is severely overrated.
Lupin the Third Part I,I don’t remember the last time there was so much hype surrounding a show. I’m trying to wait until the seasons over to binge it but it’s getting harder each week!
Lupin the Third Part I,So tripping over the fact I watched the new episode with my mom of all people because apparently she is really into it. Pretty cool how its even pulling in people who have no frame of reference of the source material who are just loving it.
Lupin the Third Part I,"Crazy how if you make a good show, people will watch it."
Lupin the Third Part I,"Three seasons would be good, please dont drag it out forever like the walking dead"
Lupin the Third Part I,"I'm curious if the show is also driving sales/downloads of the game. I think it's one of the ps plus classics they're giving away. 

Though it's been out for so long and in the video game world people have been raving about it since release, so I don't even know how big any untapped market could be."
Lupin the Third Part I,"hopefully this sparks tv shows of other games. 

outlast, a good resident evil series, the evil within, amnesia, dying light, bio shock, horizon zero dawn, fallout, dead island, assassins creed. 

there is such a wealth of quality tv show content that could be made from existing video game universes"
Lupin the Third Part I,Oh boy I can't wait for the David episode
Lupin the Third Part I,It’s almost like good quality and slow releases build audience.
Lupin the Third Part I,I'm surprised that I like it since I can't stand anything zombie.
Lupin the Third Part I,"shows the benefit of streaming, can watch the service instead of having to have cable"
Lupin the Third Part I,Sony must be happy.
Lupin the Third Part I,E3 hit me right in the feels
Lupin the Third Part I,Some would say it is growing like a fungus.
Lupin the Third Part I,It was pretty good.
Lupin the Third Part I,I’d be one too if hbo max app wasn’t crap
Lupin the Third Part I,"Bruh i hope season two goes with the longer episodes every time, the shorter ones leave me wanting more but ep 1 n 3 really felt like complete episodes"

Detectorists,"For anyone missing how comforting and sweet this show is, or for anyone just discovering it now, there's going to be a new 75 minute special dropping this Boxing Day. I can't wait to find out what our boys have been up to."
Detectorists,"The show is like a warm blanket on a cold day.

The stakes aren't high but you still root for the characters. 

There is a thing called hang out movies, & I think this show is the closest to a hang out TV show.

The music is very sweet, I feel like I did watching TV as a kid on the weekend mornings."
Detectorists,"I love this show, it was so good.  It's wholesome and comforting and funny.  They really did an excellent job.  I'm waiting to watch the new show by Crook, Worzel Gummidge.  I haven't found it streaming anywhere yet.

You should check out Doc martin, it's pretty good and 10 seasons."
Detectorists,It must be because of simon and garfunkel.
Detectorists,"One of my favorite shows that I found this year. So many other shows just seem to require so much investment, emotionally or keeping up with big complex storylines, watching Detectorists is like having a hectic day in a city and finding a nice peaceful little park outside of the noise to have a bit of peaceful downtime."
Detectorists,It’s a wonderful show and I think you explained why.
Detectorists,"It's a quaint, sincere program. No shame in that, mate. It's why we all enjoy The Detectorists so much!"
Detectorists,It’s probably the best slice-of-life show I’ve ever seen. Everything from casting to the writing is perfect. Each character seems like they could be an actual person.
Detectorists,Great show for sure. It's funny how often I see the actors from that show in different things like the PoTC I never noticed beforehand.
Detectorists,"Because it's got one of the top 5 greatest theme songs of all time

https://youtu.be/Q58Gm18-IMY"
Detectorists,Panchayat is an Indian show available on Netflix (in the UK at least) which really captures a similar feel. It's amazing.
Detectorists,"Because it is some of the best tv there’s been tbh, something about facing the creeping reality of normalcy with a brave face is something we can all relate to."
Detectorists,"As someone who is a metal detectorist or as the show title says a detectorist, we all tuned in for the metal detecting aspect. However, the real appeal is the story of two friends who care greatly about each other. It really is about the story of friendship. As the executive producer and star of the show said once in an interview, it could have been almost any type of similar activity such as golf, but it all revolves around male friendship"
Detectorists,"My daughter (US) is attending university in England this semester. I took her over to help and tour. One of our outings was to the British Museum and as we exited, they were setting up a film crew. We stayed around to watch and found it was for the Detectorists. I had not heard about it before, but have thought about getting caught up on it. When we got back to our hotel room that night, a few episodes were airing and we watched them, but had little context to characters and plot lines."
Detectorists,Wow - Detectorists is one of my favorite shows and I had no idea there was going to be a new episode!
Detectorists,"Rosehaven comes to mind. Along with Mum, these are probably my top three shows that few people have heard about."
Detectorists,Toby Jones is in everything.
Detectorists,Lovely.
Detectorists,I like this expression immensely. “The creeping reality of normalcy.” Recalls to mind that line from Whitehead regarding the essence of tragedy. It resides not in sadness but in “the solemnity of the remorseless working of things.”
Detectorists,"But I also love how imperfect the friendship is. I wrote this post on starting a rewatch and the way they position against one another in competition for the meager social capital in play is cruel, interesting, and deeply relatable."
Detectorists,Streaming on Amazon with commercials. It’s a relatively quick watch. 19 30-minute episodes.
Detectorists,Thanks! I will check it out.

Detectorists,"I’m m really looking forward to this show, more than anything over the Xmas period."
Detectorists,"Such a tender, amusing show."
Detectorists,Love this show. Hope they decide to make more seasons.
Detectorists,"Oh I've been both excited and nervous for this for AGES. Excited because it's more Detectorists, nervous because it ended so so perfectly. I'm thrilled that it's apparently as great as I want it to be."
Detectorists,I wish this post was more popular. Please watch this every one
Detectorists,Does anyone know if this will ever be available in the US?
Detectorists,Where does it stream ?
Detectorists,I'm so happy for this. It's such a great show.
Detectorists,*cue happy gold dance*
Detectorists,God these 2 need to play Nobby Nobbs and Fred Colon from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld
Detectorists,"This was fantastic, i loved the ending"
Detectorists,"What is it about this show?  On the surface, there's no single element that I especially like, I'm not into the topic at all, there's no good reason I should like this show, nothing I can point to to say ""This, this is what I like about it"".  But I do like it, and I don't know why."
Detectorists,The very great Toby Jones. One of our very greatest living actors right now.
Detectorists,If there’s no Barbecue and Foot Massage then I’m rioting
Detectorists,"Favorite TV show. It arrived, told an enjoyable story, and ended deliberately before it could ever get bad."
Detectorists,Will you search through the loamy earth for me?
Detectorists,"did i just see it 
on [youtube](https://youtu.be/DZ5g3Q2RM3c)?"
Detectorists,I’m a metal detectorist. I didn’t watch this program but lots of metal detectorists did. They were on Facebook metal detecting groups posting the Lord’s Prayer with the words changed. The BBC really are scumbags. Mocking Christ at Christmas time. Can you imagine the uproar if they were mocking Allah at Ramadan? Muslims wouldn’t stand for it. They would do a terrorist attack. As a Christian nation why do we let the BBC get away with this?
Detectorists,"This like a comedy or a documentary?

One dude from pirates of the Caribbean the other from MCU movies."
Detectorists,Christmas special. You’re welcome
Detectorists,I adored the Detectorists!
Detectorists,WHY only the first 2 seasons are often available online? season 3 only seems available on disk
Detectorists,"Loved this show. Us here, how can I watch the Xmas special??"
Detectorists,Aren’t these guys dumb and dumber from pirates of the Caribbean?
Detectorists,Ooooo
Detectorists,Just finished. Loved it.
Detectorists,What did you think of it?
Detectorists,January 9th on something called Acorn is what I was able to find out
Detectorists,According to [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/us/tv-show/detectorists) the previous 3 seasons are fairly widely available in the US so I'd be surprised if it did not appear somewhere relatively soon after the UK broadcast.
Detectorists,I started watching it on freevee with ads through Amazon prime. It’s very entertaining and a great show so far.
Detectorists,"It’s not out until this evening (7 hours from now), then it’ll probably be out on BBC iPlayer, after it finishes."
Detectorists,Genius casting tbh
Detectorists,But they're short & skinny and tall & fat.
Detectorists,"It's a well written piece of observational drama about interesting, believable characters."
Detectorists,"Very human characters with very human flaws who are all just trying their best, but all their petty life stuff feels small against the vast scope of the history that they explore. There's something soothing about that."
Detectorists,Companionship and healthy bonds with friends shared over a joint passion.
Detectorists,It has a wonderful sense of humanity. Something sorely missing from most productions these days
Detectorists,dang. well good find for me anyway
Detectorists,That’s the old one
Detectorists,"No this is an old special from 2015. 

The new one is 2022 and 75 minutes long."
Detectorists,"It's a gentle comedy. It's got a lot of tender and touching moments. It's small.


It's one of the best television series I've ever watched in my entire life."
Detectorists,[trailer for the series](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aAud_H_0R3c&feature=emb_logo)
Detectorists,It’s a sitcom that ended 5 years ago.
Detectorists,St. Stephen’s Day special?
Detectorists,"It's Christmas?!?!?!

Wow thanks for mentioning it"
Detectorists,It should be called a Boxing day special. So inaccurate!
Detectorists,"Series 3 is generally very hard to find officially, bit annoying for sure"
Detectorists,VPN and use BBC iPlayer.
Detectorists,One of them is.
Detectorists,"Quite honestly... I hated it. 

Well, that's strong, but I really disliked it, wish I had never seen it, and am now wiping it from my memory. 

It felt purposeless, they had to retcon the whole S3 to make it work, it just retreaded old ground from previous storylines, they made everyone miserable for no reason, the time skip just felt weird and meant that a lot of stuff ended up feeling unresolved, and the Holy Grail was *much* better as a throwaway joke in S1 than it was as an actual theoretically real thing they could have found. The only thing about it that I can remember that I really liked was the ""prayer"" said before the rally which was hilarious. Everything else just felt... why are we here? 

Honestly, though, it was the retconning that made me the angriest. If they had to purposely dismantle everything from S3- Lance's relationships with both Kate and (to whatever degree) Toni, Andy and family's new house and approach to life, the money- in order to make whatever this was, then what was the point in doing it at all? And what was the point in making that all happen in S3 anyway?

I was wary of the special for reasons I said above, but my hope was that people who made those first 3 seasons would only make a fourth if they had something really interesting to say. I was sad that that was apparently not the case."
Detectorists,Thanks!
Detectorists,Is that like corncob tv?
Detectorists,Ty info
Detectorists,That’s now!
Detectorists,They are as close to perfect as were gonna get i think
Detectorists,Christmas is 12 days long.
Detectorists,"Totally hear you, uuuuuuugh. I mean, I loved it in a way because it was *more Detectorists* but I’m going to pretend it’s not canon. I’m mad the cottage burned, mad about the tree coins, mad about Lance being completely weird and unhinged the whole time, etc. 

Oh I agree the prayer was great. And I liked… okay I don’t know if this is an accepted theory, but I choose to believe the lemonade guy from the party is Sheila’s long-lost child and she knows or suspects? And that’s why he likes her terrible lemonade.

I guess tl;dr I am mad about some stuff and would like to have some words with Mackenzie Crook."
Detectorists,I didn't rig shit! They told me that at a dinner!
Detectorists,Spaceballs 🪖
Detectorists,Brilliant news. This show is the best comfort show ever.
Detectorists,What you got?
Detectorists,"Ngl, I needed this news today.

*""IIII WILL BE YOUR TREASURRRRRRRRE!!""*"
Detectorists,"Blooming excellent news this. Such a funny, wholesome show, perfect for an Xmas special."
Detectorists,Hopefully they find some more BOATs (Bits off a tractor).
Detectorists,Lemonade anyone ?
Detectorists,"Keep an eye on those magpies this time around, gents."
Detectorists,5.45 pm on a Tuesday and this is the best news I have had all day. What a fabulous show.
Detectorists,Fuck I love this show. As an American I believe British cinema is highly underrated over here. I just recently discovered the gem ‘New Tricks’.
Detectorists,I like the direction Gareth’s life took after he left Wernham Hogg.
Detectorists,"This is the best show ever. Does anyone know the cheapest way to watch in the states? Streaming platforms, rental, etc?"
Detectorists,##WOOHOOOHOOOOOO!
Detectorists,Well I'm just going to have to make sure I'm fully caught up (for the fourth time) before it airs.
Detectorists,Any recommendations on how to watch in the states?
Detectorists,This has made my day!!
Detectorists,I need a half hour of new Detectorists each week.
Detectorists,Nooo the last episode was so good. Think it’s my favourite last episode of any show.

Sensitive Skin,Are any of the actors as hot as Kaya Scodelario?
Sensitive Skin,"I just finished it, definitely warmed to it with each episode. I was quite pleasantly surprised that there was a ""sexual awakening"" storyline, but with no drama or inner turmoil... it was just fine."
Sensitive Skin,Kaya was like 14/15 when she started skins ...
Sensitive Skin,lol you'd be watching for the wrong reasons. ^but ^if ^i'm ^being ^honest... ^no.
Sensitive Skin,"Given the audience it's aimed at, a lot of people were probably that age when they were watching. reddit is young. Some people reading this right now are probably still that age. Not everyone watched the show as it aired.

She was on the show though after she was no longer underage."
Sensitive Skin,"They way shots are set up, at least in the ads, it looks like 30 rock or Kimmy Schmidt. Tina Fey definitely has a visual style."
Sensitive Skin,People need to give this show a few more episodes. 30 Rock didn’t really click until Tracy does Conan.
Sensitive Skin,Tina Fey is hilarious.   I didn’t know that this was her show.   I’ll have to check it out.
Sensitive Skin,"For most of the article it seemed like they weren't giving the show a shot. Taking weird digs at 30 Rock and Kimmy Schmidt for offensive jokes. I remember the (years too late) blackface controversy for 30 Rock but I didn't think either show was really offensive. 

I've never equated Tina Fey with being offensive.

At least they seemed more optimistic with the second episode. It didn't sound like they thought the show was bad, just that it offended them mostly in the first episode. Comparing new comedies (they did this to AP Bio, which I love) to all time greats really early does the new show a disservice."
Sensitive Skin,"Trash opinion piece pathetically trying to gatekeep comedy. Unclench your buttholes already, HuffPost"
Sensitive Skin,"I found it funny.  I guess pointing out things that do happen and conservations that are happening isn’t okay to them.  I guess to whoever wrote this, jokes about old, rich, white men are the only things that will be allowed anymore.  How much was “30 rock” punching up with all their black jokes with Tracy?  Or Kimmy Schmidt might be making fun of trauma victims.   The line of what can be comedy shouldn’t be made by Huffington post writers trying to stir up controversy."
Sensitive Skin,"I’m pretty liberal and found the jokes funny. You need to re-evaluate if you’re unable to poke fun at yourself (and that’s a quality you’d find yourself sharing with a certain orange fascist). Of course there’s real cultural appropriation issues out there, but if you can’t make jokes about something until every wrong about it is righted, then everything is off limits. Also, if we’re ok using the nuttiest stuff on the right as a source of humor, then the nuttiest stuff on the left is fair game too."
Sensitive Skin,This show screams “needs a season to figure it out”. Unless it does it by the end of the season. But if it does it could be great.
Sensitive Skin,I really enjoyed the first 2 episodes and it feels like a show that is either cancelled in S1 or goes onto 3 or 4 seasons.
Sensitive Skin,What a really bad show.  Vella Lovell had a much better written character on Crazy Ex Girlfriend and she was way sexier on that show.
Sensitive Skin,"Of course HuffPo’s problem with the show is one of the only things that works. No, it’s not “punching down” to mock cancel culture. People are demanding the utter annihilation other people’s livelihoods over ridiculous and unreasonable things. I guess it’s hard to find the humor in that when you’ve led plenty of sanctimonious witchhunts yourself."
Sensitive Skin,This blogger is sensitive as fuck.
Sensitive Skin,"I thought the ensemble for this felt weak. Yeah it's got Danson and Hunter, but neither felt too interesting for a comedy series. Moynihan's jokes felt forced.

In think Tina Fey's work is just hit or miss for me. If I hear that this series gets better, I'll look back into it. Looking at the series right now though, I'm not seeing anything or anyone that really grabs me and stands out."
Sensitive Skin,"> makes fun of actual cultural appropriation

So the entitled white kids who made a stink about Taco Tuesday at some University as cultural appropriation (while hispanic and non-hispanic studentss were enjoying it)   were actually Tina Fey comedy writers?

Dear author of this article, there are actually protests against cultural appropriation in real life that were wrong-headed and should be made fun of."
Sensitive Skin,Article is pretty accurate actually but I enjoy fey shows overall.  Her sitcoms are unlike anything else out there.  Only David Caspe shows have some of that type of humor though not as much
Sensitive Skin,This show is funny now and will certainly get better with time
Sensitive Skin,"For me those were the high points of the show, the progressive preaching is what turned me off."
Sensitive Skin,Watched the premiere.  They did the usual network TV thing of portraying the left as a bunch of overwrought screeching idiots.  Won't be watching again.  Crap like this is why I stopped watching network TV.
Sensitive Skin,"I'm extremely physically disabled, and I was INCREDIBLY offended! 

That this article was offended by the straw joke! 

But seriously, I don't know, maybe I just have a thick skin in regards to my disability; I don't speak for everyone... but I do wonder if anyone who is physically disabled was actually offended by this. I thought ""Oh, cool. They mentioned one of the few staw ban problems,"" not ""How dare the bumbling main character get tricked into using very silly, made-up names for quadriplegics!"" 

I laughed less than in previous Feylock shows, but that wasn't because they made fun of me."
Sensitive Skin,I haven't seen anyone mention that this was originally supposed to be a spinoff of 30rock with Jack Donaghy as mayor of NYC.
Sensitive Skin,"It is identical in the set up, they even have flashbacks ('callbacks') in the first 2 episodes, the only missing thing is the whoosh sound when going into a callback like in 30 rock. I also noticed they have the same attention to detail that 30 rock where all characters on screen are still 'on character' while the scene rolls. I noticed in ep. 2 Bobby Moynihan's character is almost out of frame in a scene but with his reaction he is also being part of the absurd joke Danson is saying"
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,"I watched the first episode and honestly I was blown away by how cheap everything looked. It looked really, really bad."
Sensitive Skin,I find that with most sitcoms. Parks and Recreation has an incredibly average first season and its one of my all time favourite sitcoms
Sensitive Skin,Comedy gets judged more harshly then other tv genres. People expect to be dying of laughter in the episode whereas quite often the shows need time to breathe and viewers get to know and understand the characters.
Sensitive Skin,First episode was pretty bad in my book..second one started to find its groove.
Sensitive Skin,"I maintain that if they had just called the show *Untitled Tina Fey/Ted Danson Project*, that title would attract more viewers than *Mr. Mayor.*

It's just a boring, uninspired title."
Sensitive Skin,"Tina Fey is never really offensive in terms of content or conceptual things. There's nothing really baked into her worldview or style that isn't pretty textbook moderate liberal ethos with a helping of pop feminism on top.

However... she has this occasional tendency to try and poke the bear with racial humor, by putting in something deliberately offensive but so outrageous that you know she's not being serious. It's almost like she wants to see how much she can get away with; the recurring use of blackface humor on ""30 Rock"" obviously isn't coming from a place of active racism or minstrelsy, but it's from the standpoint of ""ooh, blackface is naughty... how much will people let me use it before somebody stops me?"" So it starts with the ""black Swanns"" gag, and gradually escalates to the infamous ""Amos and Andy"" sketch. And when people criticized similar use of racial tomfoolery in the first season of ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmitt,"" she added a whole episode about it in season 2.

I worry she's going to have her Elvis Costello moment where she, attempting to be edgy and shocking, says or produces something she can't walk back, and has to do the whole apology circuit for it. (If you're unfamiliar with the story, Elvis Costello tried to end a conversation he was tiring of by sarcastically dismissing Ray Charles as an ""ignorant n****r."" Despite the fact that he was being deliberately inflammatory and insincere, he still spent a long time trying to atone for his comments, including the somewhat strange apology of making an entire faux-Motown album.)"
Sensitive Skin,I only find her offensive in the Garnier ads. Those treat women as if they're complete morons.
Sensitive Skin,"It's ironic. The show mocks the type of character the author is. So, naturally, the author goes to write this piece and inadvertently prove this type of character deserves to be mocked."
Sensitive Skin,The gatekeepers of comedy have been very good to Tina Fey.
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,"One of the great charms of 30 Rock was that they played Jack Donaghey's character straight -- he was a powerful successful businessman, the protoypical NY republican. he had a shit ton of foibles and they used him to parody many inequities in life, but he wasn't a push over and he could incisively cut down any 'progressive' character or artistic type in his midst."
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,"Liberals literally never see themselves get made fun of in pop culture, so the slightest scratch feels like an agony.

Indeed, they are currently trying to ensure that they never have to see a single belief that contradicts their own. Ever. And most of them seem to think that's awesome.

It's nice that you have thick skin. But the rest of your type is turning themselves into fascists because they refuse to grow any.

Edit: Surely, your insane hysteria at having the truth told about you will prove me wrong. You're not in any way acting like a child with their first paper cut."
Sensitive Skin,"Cultural appropriation is American entitlement. Not attacking you, just throwing the disclaimer out there to (try to) get rid of this absurd cultural gatekeeing"
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,"I think you're the one that needs to relax a bit, jesus."
Sensitive Skin,"It is the perfect show to binge, it would be a top 10 at Netflix, like  'Great News' (also related to Fey/Carlock) this format seems perfect to enjoy in rounds of 2 or 3 episodes."
Sensitive Skin,Lol so basically just not a 2 season show
Sensitive Skin,"HuffPo are the same people that were so proud of the 'diversity' or their editors or something, yet were all white women.

Virtue signaling is their entire identity,"
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,Thicker skin might help?
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,"Fey’s shows are almost like a live action cartoon, but with more focus on sharp writing and characters than all out gags.  30 Rock is a prime example of this, the show doesn’t take itself to seriously but it doesn’t run its jokes (or characters) into the ground"
Sensitive Skin,"Agreed. It has similar composition as her other shows, but the actual cinematography just looks so, I dunno, inauthentic? Like a web series or something from a film school."
Sensitive Skin,Oh definitely the first season of Parks and Rec wasn’t great but retooling Leslie and adding Ben and Chris in the second season helped the show immensely.
Sensitive Skin,"Yeah it's pretty common for sitcoms to get pitched with fairly unspecific characters so that actors can bring a lot to the table, and writers getting a lot better at figuring out what they can do with them after they've seen the actors play them for a few episodes."
Sensitive Skin,Brooklyn 99 probably had one of the strongest first seasons. It felt like all those people have been working with each other for years.
Sensitive Skin,"> I find that with most sitcoms.

true, but the legendary ones started off great

Cheers pilot episode is fantastic from start to finish

Seinfeld pilot also great

New Girl hit the ground running"
Sensitive Skin,True but Superstore is also a pretty boring title.   Or even Community.
Sensitive Skin,"I thought the blackface in 30 Rock did a good job satirizing it. The Amos n Andy sketch in particular with how Tracy Morgan’s character getting increasingly angry. The other ones are mostly shock value bur work for Jenna’s character. 

I thought Jacqueline’s Native American background was funny but I can see that rubbing people the wrong way. I think that’s why Fey included the redskins plot. The Titus Geisha episode was definitely a misfire though. Felt way too over the top. 

Also Fey always gets the brunt of the criticism but what about Robert Carlock? He’s the coshowrunner and writes just as much as she does."
Sensitive Skin,Nailed it
Sensitive Skin,"Yeah there's unfortunately a lot of people who have ""white privilege"" so ingrained into their brains that somehow it's find to make fun of uneducated, rural white folks, but not okay to make fun of black people even if they have a 3 billion dollar net worth."
Sensitive Skin,Jack is also the 2nd most sympathetic character imo.
Sensitive Skin,"I want to add that appropriation implies that something (in this case culture) is taken away and kept for yourself, which is bad. But this isn't the case with culture. Like you said culture is shared. It's like someone purposefully chose word ""appropriation"" when coining ""cultural appropriation"" so it would imply it is a bad thing."
Sensitive Skin,"True, what it mostly comes down to is that as a culture gets more mainstreamed and more people know things about it, tasteless jokes are seen as offensive, while smart and thoughtful jokes are more accepted."
Sensitive Skin,You ever watch Portlandia?
Sensitive Skin,"This is a wonderful example of making fun of what a conservative might say about this situation.

Edit: that edit is golden. Thanks for sticking with the joke."
Sensitive Skin,"Veep doesn't pull punches on the left or right. How many shows are made by conservatives that rip on conservatism? I guess there's that Tim Allen show, but I've never watched it so idk if he makes fun of the right on it."
Sensitive Skin,"That's blatently untrue and you're just trolling. Back to my point about the nuttiest, they're also the most vocal and will be doing the most pearl clutching on twitter. That's who you're describing as having the slightest scratch feel like agony. It's not because they haven't seen themselves get made fun of, it's because they've internalized any slight as being a mountain instead of a molehill."
Sensitive Skin,"the biggest irony of your drivel of a comment is you're an active member of r/conservative, the biggest snowflake sub around. if there's a post that might hurt your widdle feelings, it immediately goes ""flared user only"", so only people who garggle the qanon propaganda can post. so yeah, please talk more about contradictory beliefs and feelings 🤡"
Sensitive Skin,"> Liberals literally never see themselves get made fun of in pop culture

Is this a real opinion? How old are you? Hillary Clinton has been the butt of jokes in mainstream pop culture for 30 years. I was watching an episode of Scrubs earlier today that was mocking HillDawg."

Sensitive Skin,It’s a random reference but I will always upvote bringing back happy endings
Sensitive Skin,Nah.  I just don't find it funny.  I don't find most sitcoms funny.  I find watching people do incredibly stupid things or having long drawn out plot lines over things that would be easily resolved in three sentences in real life just not entertaining any more.  Give me more Joe Bob Briggs.
Sensitive Skin,I'm not even going to get into a political debate with you in this particular subreddit.
Sensitive Skin,[deleted]
Sensitive Skin,"I've been rewatching it and they do rely too much on some jokes templates like jenna saying  ""this is like that time mikey rourke did something terrible to me"", jack business jargon, or kenneth farm jokes. it suffered from a little bit of flanderization but to be fair the show predates modern streaming and has basically as much meta humour as community if not more because of TGS."
Sensitive Skin,"Exactly. I did find some jokes funny but some didn’t land, and the fact that it looks so cheap to me turned me off. Might let it play out for a while before I see if it’s worth continuing or not."
Sensitive Skin,Plus they made Andy a lot more likeable
Sensitive Skin,"Even then there were a few teething issues - they had no idea how to use Terry Crews for the first season or two and had to drop the weird cringey storyline about Boyle being obsessed with Rosa. Even after they sorted those out, it turned out the show couldn't really use Gina and pushed her to the edge of episodes over time. I just think sitcoms always take a while to figure out what they are working with"
Sensitive Skin,"For me, I enjoyed the first season but it was not a strong start. So much so that I didn't bother with the show for a couple of seasons. It took being stuck inside for a week and needing something to pass the time for me to get through the first season and then I started really enjoying the show."
Sensitive Skin,"I'm just fascinated that one person would list New Girl alongside Cheers and Seinfeld as ""the classics.""

Not hating, but that is a very eclectic 3 sitcom combination.

Also, I think it can work either way. I think a lot of sitcoms get funnier with time as they start to utilize in-jokes, callbacks, etc. I think in a lot of cases, great comedies are simply character driven, not so much narrative driven, so knowing the characters better can make them much funnier."
Sensitive Skin,"The Office is legendary and I wouldn’t call its first season great (not bad but nowhere near its peak). 

Parks and Rec’s first season is famously terrible. 

The Simpsons first season is not good. 

It’s Always Sumy in Philadelphia only found its stride when they added Danny DeVito

Also I’m not sure what pilot of Seinfeld you’ve seen but it’s also famous terrible lol. Elaine isn’t even in it, Kramer is named Kessler and the whole episode is just about one of Jerry’s relationships. It also didn’t enthuse audiences nor the network, the show was on the chopping block for like 3 seasons before it became a big hit. 

It doesn’t apply for every show but I would say as a rule it’s more likely that a good or great sitcom starts poorly than great."
Sensitive Skin,"I watch Seinfeld all the time but I do not like the pilot or first season. The pilot even had a wise cracking waitress that would never be seen again, Kessler (Kramer) has a dog and never leaves the building and it was negatively received.  Certainly not a great pilot."
Sensitive Skin,"I love New Girl but it doesn’t belong there with Cheer or Seinfield. 

Replace New Girl with Friends and you’ve got your example."
Sensitive Skin,"When I say most sitcoms, I'm more referring to modern sitcoms to be honest"
Sensitive Skin,"> I thought Jacqueline’s Native American background was funny but I can see that rubbing people the wrong way. I think that’s why Fey included the redskins plot. The Titus Geisha episode was definitely a misfire though. Felt way too over the top. 

Huh, I actually feel the exact opposite. Jacqueline's Native-Americanness felt like a one-trick pony that never got out the stable (I mean -- WTF was up with that? The plot never even went anywhere, it was only ever good for a couple cutaways barely more substantial than Family Guy sketches). The Titus geisha thing was funny and brief enough not to overstay its welcome.

Honestly I felt like that show would have been better if Jacqueline and her daughter were removed entirely. They were like a piece of a different show parasitically attached to Kimmy."
Sensitive Skin,"I personally loved the Amos n Andy sketch; it reminded me of a more satirically pointed version of the ""spear-chucker"" sketch with Richard Pryor on classic SNL. But I get why some people are rubbed the wrong way by Fey's use of even satirical blackface. 

When I did the development of the ""Night of the Living Dead"" musical, we made Harry the survivalist a bit more of a crude figure than he is in the original movie, combining him with elements of the redneck truck driver that was replaced by the black schoolteacher in the finished film. There were lots of debates about how racist we could let him be: the joke was always on him and his ignorance, but we wondered at what point it crossed the line.

My initial draft of the final fight between Harry and Ben was that the straw that breaks the camel's back would be Harry finally dropping the n-bomb after days of provocation in the farmhouse. We ended up dialing the racial content far back and leaving Harry's racism more implied than explicit for fear of the Dave Chappelle effect, where audiences laugh differently if they're laughing AT a character's racism or WITH the character's racism."
Sensitive Skin,Donald Glover was also a writer on 30 Rock.
Sensitive Skin,"Also it implies that everyone's just copying each other. It's entirely possible that two distinct cultures came up with the idea of braids at the same time.

""Cultural appropriation"" seems to just be a way for modern people to segregate everyone in a way they can pretend is woke and not racist."

Missing You,So? When I worked at a newspaper we all had to update obits and listicles like this annually for famous people our audience cared about. It’s totally normal.
Missing You,No one talked to the camera during the finale. Felt weird. 
Missing You,I'm genuinely emotional. I'd grown to love and root for the characters on this show that they felt like dear friends. And seeing it end the way it did made me happy to know they were each happy as well. 
Missing You,"Terrific send-off! I love these characters. I'm glad it mostly focused on the principle cast instead of trying to pack in all the secondary characters, though one last bit of Jamm would've done me right.

Kind of expected a small Brendanawicz cameo but I realize now it wouldn't have fit."
Missing You,"I will really miss this show a lot. It does something a lot of shows don't do and that is make every main character likable, funny, and relatable. This show inspired a lot of my humor and had a big impact on me. This show was great and was something awesome to look forward to on TV.Thank You Parks N Rec, for being one of the best shows ever."
Missing You,I've never felt this satisfied watching a tv show before. 
Missing You,"That was a beautiful finale, really going to miss this show."
Missing You,"Sitting here at 4am, crying and singing that Lil Sebastian song(quite poorly, I don't know the lyrics but I know how to hum it well enough).

A great send off to a great show. "
Missing You,"so who ended up being President Ben Or Leslie?
"
Missing You,"What a great tribute letter to a fantastic show.  Really nice.
"
Missing You,"The finale was nice, but on the whole the final season felt off, like it should have been a movie and not a full season. A lot was built up that only sort of felt resolved by the end. Things were introduced (Andy and April buying a house) only to be thrown away later (never mind, they're moving to Washington). 

And while I enjoyed the finale, and some of the resolutions and the return of Ann and Chris, I had three main issues:
1) The ""documentary"" style TV show just doesn't work if its there for no reason. Even if they don't go ""The Office"" route and acknowledge this was an actual show, the finale's jumps ahead in time pretty much cemented it as just an odd TV storytelling device. A bit too much liberty taken with all the jumps, if you ask me, leading me to:

2) It's bad enough that this entire season jumped ahead 3 years, with jokes and ideas that didn't always work. But then the finale spent half its time jumping ahead another five years from that (and in one instance, almost 30). Might as well have done each episode of the season as another jump ahead in time. Seeing the future of the future seemed unnecessary to me. Like that one Babylon 5 that kept jumping ahead millennia.

3) No Mark Brendanawicz?? Come on! I know that he's from before everyone started watching and a lot of viewers wouldn't know who he was or care, but I kept hoping for one last appearance so he could congratulate Leslie on her park or something. He should have been at the big event last season, and it does kind of tick me off that he never got a final moment on this show, but Brandi Maxx did. I totally understand and approve bringing back Chris and April, but Brendanawicz was an original cast member and they Tasha Yar'd him. No, Tasha got to come back for the finale. They Jadzia Dax'd him."
Missing You,"I've lived in Indiana my whole life.  And, surprisingly avoided teen pregnancy, meth, and losing my teeth.  This state sucks its inhabitants are ignorant and off putting.  I moved here when I was in first grade.  My teacher asked what family I was from so I told her my last name and was treated like a used condom from then on.  Holy fuck abandon this fucking shit hole of a state.  You won't get a friendly welcome here.  Unless you are in Carmel or north Indy.  If you can move there go ahead great education and worthwhile public funding.  Just treat the rest of the state lime a radioactive fall out zone.  Love parks and rec...  "

Missing You,It seemed like Ben stared at the camera more than he usually does though
Missing You,"At least we got the awesome episode with Jamm and Tammy 2, I thought it was nice send off for the character.  "
Missing You,Michael Schur said there would be an extended finale (on the final season DVD) where we'll see what happened to Jamm! 
Missing You,"Yes, I'm saddened at no Brendanawicz cameo. They got in one last library joke, but no Brendanawicz at all."
Missing You,"I think Ben because he acknowledges the secret service agent,  but I enjoyed how they left it ambiguous. "
Missing You,"To be honest, Brandi Maxx is a better representation of the town of Pawnee and the show's values than Mark Brendanawicz. Brandi is a hard working, self-motivated business woman who just wants to use some of her fame to become an active part in the community that she loves. Not to mention, she was one of the few people in the town outside of the parks department that truly supported Leslie. You might even say she was inspired by Leslie and wants to be like her. 

Brandi Maxx earned her send off and honestly, I was so happy for her when it was revealed she was part of the town council. She never gave up on her community and worked hard to be a part of what made it special. She deserved a happy ending. "
Missing You,The actor of Mark has been quite vocal about not wanting to return to the show.

Missing You,The best part about Parks and Rec is Chris Pratt.  He's a huge star now and could easily leave the show but he didn't.  He also didn't leverage his star status into a bigger part for the last season.  Its just fantastic that he came back and is the same Andy.
Missing You,"Just changing channels and having something that will like catch my attention, also helped having a lot of procedurals where I didn't really need to know the plot.

Also back in the day if there was something on TV on the weekend most people will have likely watched that same thing by the beginning of the week and easy to talk about it. Now... people probably don't want to talk about a show until they get time to binge watch it. Then again things like reddit were not quite as prominent so easier to find another community for it."
Missing You,"Holliday episodes where whacky fun shit happens because “just because”

I like them because it allows characters to explore relationship dynamics"
Missing You,Saturday morning cartoons
Missing You,"I've pretty much gone full circle in that I appreciate weekly episodes instead of full season drops. Some shows seems to need that gap between episodes so that you can talk about it, analyze and build up anticipation for next week. 

&#x200B;

I do however like that TV are more ""movie like"" with a full story arc over a season and higher production value."
Missing You,"The classic writing structure of traditional tv. Each 45 minute episode had a set-up, a climax and something at the end that made you wanna tune in again next week (could be a cliffhanger, could also just be an emotionally satisfying end of the specific episode arc that gave you happy feels). 

That style of writing made it happen that viewers still - many years later - distinctly remember specific episodes of LOST or Buffy or early Supernatural.

New shows written for the binge model tend to blur together. You remember individual scenes more than full episodes. Lots of episodes just kinda end and continue in the next one, with not much thought about when to make the cut. The biggest downside for me of treating every story like an 8 hour movie and not like a tv show."
Missing You,">it gave fans a predictable timetable of when they could expect their shows to come back, whereas now, not only do most shows take over one year to come back, but it varies between seasons.

I do miss that. While the downsides of that system outweigh the benefits (I'm happier without it), I do acknowledge that there was a benefit to predictability. The 2-year gap between the end of S5 of Better Call Saul and the premiere of S6 was brutal."
Missing You,I miss the 20 episode seasons
Missing You,Cultural zeitgeist
Missing You,"This is gonna be weird, but the idea that you don't have much of a choice on what's on.

It's like that BDSM thing where people get off on being told what to do. Streaming lets us have all these choices, but we sometimes get paralyzed and end up watching nothing. 

TV forces you to just accept what's on and you won't be inclined to switch channels or put shows on hold because there's no way to watch what you missed."
Missing You,"Im sure others can think of more examples but I inly know of one that comes to mind but it was viral advertising for shows. During I think season 2 of Lost, after episodes aired, a fake Oceanic Airlines ad would run, it had a number to call and the number would play a strange message. It basically led to an ARG game through a website that provided more mysteries and lore into the island and such."
Missing You,"Shouting ""it's ONNNNN"" as the show comes back from commercial and hearing madly running feet as everyone hurries to make it back in time.

It was also very different when there was no guarantee that there would necessarily ever be re-runs of anything, so there was at least some sense that this might be the only time you could experience something.  Now you get people saying 'well I'm looking forward to seeing how this works for me on a rewatch' almost as soon as a new series drops, which is for sure a nice option to have, but a very different experience with the stories."
Missing You,I miss premiere week in September and watching all my shows until May where they would all end roughly around the same time. I also miss watching the new episodes live rather than just watching the new episode whenever it is released in the day.
Missing You,"The expectation that you could watch a random episode of a show you'd never seen before and get a complete story with a beginning, middle and end. And if there was anything from past episodes that was relevant to that story, the show would fill you in with some exposition or *maybe* a ""Previously on..."" sequence at the beginning.

The expectation's flipped now: people expect everything to be serialised instead. I got into watching Star Trek on TV when I was a kid by watching random episodes I rented on video, and I knew that would work fine. Now you see people all the time being like ""*But where do I staaaaaaaaaaarrrt?!?!?*"""
Missing You,"I miss the watercooler aspect of discussing TV shows.

With a lot of streaming stuff being released all at once, it does not have the staying power that shows in the past did, because you don't give it time to build.

Hell, I remember Stranger Things S4 a lot better than I do the other seasons, just because they broke it up in half."
Missing You,"Yearly releases and 20-24 episode seasons. 

These nearly 2yr or longer breaks between seasons, which was happening even before Covid, is generally a death sentence for show. Rarely do shows have these long breaks and survive after the second season mostly due to the lack of advertising that the next season is even coming out. On top of that by the time the next season comes out you have mostly forgotten what happened in the previous season and have to go watch or read recaps just so you're not completely lost. Hunters is a great example of this, the first season was at the very beginning of 2020 and the second season just dropped in January so 3yrs between the seasons it's been so long we forgot most of what happened besides which main characters had been killed so we tried to rewatch some of the first season just to refresh, but unfortunately it turned out Amazon had re-edited the entire first season cutting out nearly 2hrs of content and actually cut some very important character development scenes.

I'm not saying every show needs 20-24 episode seasons, but half hour sitcoms need more than 8-10 episodes. You are just barely getting to know the characters and as soon as you are getting into the show it's already over especially with how they drop all the episodes at once rather than weekly so you have a burst of people talking about it for about a week and then it's completely forgotten about until you hear it's been canceled."
Missing You,Episodes that were basically just there to develop character. Every single thing is just plot nowadays. I Miss the balance
Missing You,"Honestly, all the ""discourse"" that surrounds every TV show is exhausting now. TV and movies were better without any of that intensity.

There is so much pre-release and post-release discussion and hype around every show and movie now. It feels like it takes away from the experience of just watching something and enjoying it, instead of having a million people try to bombard you with their hot takes online."
Missing You,"Randomly starting a show, from episode 14 season 3 because thats when you zipped and it was on, and now you watch it."
Missing You,"1. Episodic television. Obviously, story arcs are superior, but since Netflix has taken over, most streaming shows have this ""everything is one long movie"" approach to storytelling when most shows don't have a main story arc to justify it. 
A lot of shows would be better with a few single-story episodes with a story arc around it so your television show doesn't feel like one big slog with no variety in between the episodes. 

2. I miss 13 episode seasons. Definitely felt like that was the sweet spot between too much, 22-episode seasons and currently not enough 8-episode seasons."
Missing You,"The timing and hype.

LOST always comes to mind.  At its peak, I remember everyone HAD to be home watching.  During the week between episodes, there was so much speculation and discussion about what was going to happen.  It was like a weekly, mass event.

Now I feel like I'm always an episode behind, and always amazed at how everyone else seemed to find the time to binge 12 hrs of a new season all in a weekend while I'm on episode 3 of 12."
Missing You,Its easy to make convo when everybody is watching the same media.
Missing You,"1. Longer seasons.  Shorter seasons have their place, but they go by so quickly.  I am rewatching DS9 and I love that they have the space (ha!) for long story arcs, but also here's an episode about Quark's mom.
2. Being excited in the fall when TV shows came back and sweeps weeks because you knew they'd throw their best at you.  Now shows come with such unpredictability that it just feels random.
3. Finally, the way TV shows would mark the passing of time during the week.  You knew what was on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and so on.  It sort of set the tone for your whole week.  Objectively, on demand is better.  But I do kind of miss how excitement would build during the week and then you made sure you were home when the shows you really liked came on, or if you were desperate, set up a VCR.  Now I often don't even realize when new episodes have come out because it's all on demand.  I just check the streaming services and see what's new, but I don't normally think ""Thursday night, here's what is coming on."""
Missing You,Watching on the same night so we can talk about it the next day instead of working.  :)
Missing You,I miss catching up with people after the show aired the night before and chatting about it.  You can't do that anymore as everyone is on their own schedule.
Missing You,Everybody watching at the same time so you have something to talk about with co workers and friends
Missing You,"Appointment viewing! That sense of community you used to get when a show was so massively popular that pretty much everyone you knew was making time to watch it, at the same time, every single week. 

I remember during the first season of Survivor, no one ever made plans on Thursday, because that was Survivor night. Then you'd go into school or work on Friday, and know exactly what everyone was discussing."
Missing You,Knowing the time
Missing You,Bright lighting and audible dialogue
Missing You,"Just turning on the TV and flipping through channels, analog style. None of this waiting for the channel to load. Could be through 10 channels in five seconds. 

Don’t get me wrong, on the whole streaming is better. But the whole having to actively decide what to watch is annoying sometimes. Sometimes I just want to flip until I find something good enough. 

I realize of course I could still get cable and flip channels, but the commercials on non-streaming have gotten way out of control."
Missing You,"I miss finding a show because you stumble upon it while channel surfing and you would have ignored it otherwise. Many shows owe their success to being found this way and word of mouth spreading.

Now we are just fed content that is similar to everything you’ve watched before because of algorithms.

It’s an issue and what has happened to Music. Smaller artists complain they get less listens than they would before streaming because they are ignored - people listen to what is fed to them and can’t be discovered"
Missing You,"I miss being able to talk about tv shows with people in real life as opposed to just online.  When I was young, there were 3 or 4 channels and at any given time only one or maybe two of those channels would be showing anything that appealed to children, or women, or men or whatever demographic you were in.  So, the next day you could talk to whoever was at school or in the office about what you watched the night before because at least half the people around you would have watched the same thing.  Now, not only am I not watching the same shows, I have never heard of most of the shows that my friends are watching and they have never heard of the shows I am watching.  And we are the same demographic (middle aged, suburban soccer moms)!  If I want to talk about something I am watching I have to go online and talk to strangers."
Missing You,"I miss the bumpers. Not commercials but the ways that networks would create a feeling of watching their channel almost as if it were watching a stage get ready in-between scenes. 

Bumpers really gave you a different feeling about TV it feels like an experience and not just media straight to the eyeballs."
Missing You,"Something that really ended with GoT and hasn't come back even with shows like White Lotus and Last of Us: A singular television show that we can all gather around. 

There's just sooooo much content out there that even the most popular shows are only watched and spoken about by a fraction of people for a fraction of the time. So much joy of television is in the conversations with others and some of the magic is lost when so few people are watching something or everyone is watching so much their attention is split. 

The other thing... its impact on movies. I legitimately miss the theater experience. I go once in a blue moon when there's truly a movie I want to see or believe it should be seen on the big screen. But ultimately, every time is so expensive that it's hard to justify. 

I genuinely believe a critical factor to the loss of the theater movie that isn't superhero or some big action film is because everything else just goes to streaming."
Missing You,"Having non-immediate gratification.

This generation will never know about having to wait for anything,   and the exciting anticipation it would build."
Missing You,There’s something quite special about a 22 episode season taking up 6 months of your life. The stakes on a show like The OC or ER must have felt so real.
Missing You,Sweeps week.  They used to have a week where they took a snapshot of the tv ratings and used it for advertising. So during that week there would be crazy guest stars and soecial eoisodes for all your favorite shows to try to get more people to watch.
Missing You,"We watched the news.  Real news, not the endless pundit shows we have now.

We watched the national news at 5:00 because that's what was on, and then the local news after that.

The networks didn't have to compete, so they did real reporting, and in a half hour, you got 20 real news items.

Now, you can get content tailored to reinforce your own position, or you can ignore it entirely."

Missing You,"Saturday morning cartoons, Disney Afternoon, Wonderful World of Disney, TGIF"
Missing You,"The Fall TV season when the Big 3, then the Big 4 (and other broadcast networks) would introduce all their brand new shows with all the hoopla required in September through October. And the classic TV Guide Fall Preview issues that came each year."
Missing You,"Not something I miss particularly, but I understand their purpose: Filler episodes.

Filler episodes have their purpose, mainly to give some time for actors, writers and crews, they allow to be filmed in such a way they take less days to shoot, and some of the scenarii are written in advance, they also allow to change stuff up when needed, an accident, a death of an actor or a public personality (exterior to the show) or an important event.

Also they help form new writers, something that is lacking in the streaming/binging format. You get all those shows nowaday, but no real experienced writers in it
The 22-26 episodes format allowed to have some episode with rookie writer taking the helm (with some supervision from the head writer) and do their stuff and learn more.

Now, we get stuff like The Witcher, The Wheel of Time, LotR, etc... where writers want to make their mark but disregarding 30, 40, 80 years of lore... and getting a subpar product and the rage of fans.

If you compare that to other show like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, NYPD Blue, Lost, Bones, Veronica Mars, to name a few of different genre, they all have some stuff in common, they all have a clear head writer/show runner, they all have filler episodes, but they all have a lot of writers, some more experienced and other less so. But some of those lesser known writers gained fame and are now trusted to have their own project. This happens rarely with the new streaming/binging format, unless they landed one of those now trusted writers."

Missing You,"I have nostalgia for commercials from a network would have characters from different shows interact. Like cartoon network where cartoons would hang around town, or USA where you might have Michael from Burn Notice sending a care package with sunglasses and C4 to the guy from Royal Pains."
Missing You,I miss good MOTW/Supernatural shows.
Missing You,"Yup - I miss the TV season and episode releasing weekly. It was nice having the summer with just summer programming, or repeats.


I also liked having water cooler shows - now instead of a bunch of theorycrafting week by week and between the breaks, it's people watch at whatever speed and there's no real discussions. It was also nice when shows went on hiatus, there was time for people to catch up!


Now we're just inundated with shit and shows have to sink or swim - no giving them time to try to thrive, if they don't get finished in 3 weeks the series gets cancelled.


Also, filler.


8 episode seasons suck. There, I said it. Sometimes, plots need time to breathe - it doesn't have to go bam bam bam all plot all the time. Just plot doesn't let us learn as much about the characters as we would if there was at least a bit of filler. Filler episodes help us learn a lot about the characters and who they are."
Missing You,"I miss sweeps week. When shows would do the craziest stuff to get viewers.  Also one off episodes of shows with large casts so they can focus on one character who normally doesn't get enough time, or just an episode where they can goof off like in a timeloop or something.  Stuff like that is why the characters from older shows are so iconic and well remembered."
Missing You,"Hearing about a new show, and actually wanting to watch it? Most new show descriptions sound like assignments to be gotten through, rather than entertainment to be enjoyed."
Missing You,"I miss that fact that if you wanted all the shows you paid one price for all the channels(albeit a high price) and then had access to all the shows.  Now I pay for multiple streaming sites, most of which have different tiers now not to mention I have to remember login information and it’s usually just for one or two shows.  90% of the time if I think of some old movie or show I wanna watch it’s either unavailable or I have to pay separately to watch it."
Missing You,"Back in the day, when you turned the TV on, it was on. You didn't have to update software, identify which member of the household you are, or choose from 10 different streaming services before finally locating your show."
Missing You,Can’t lie I miss them catchy song commercials ngl
Missing You,"Turning on the TV and having it come on immediately, in the middle of whatever show was airing on the channel it was last on. Then you could change the channel and it was immediate.

Nowadays I turn on the TV and it takes some time to boot up. Then I have scroll to select a streaming service then I have to scroll to a show (or perform a search). 

I know I’m going tell my grandkids about the good old days when the TV just turned on. I’m sure they’ll giggle and say, “Oh grampa, you’re just making stuff up!”"
Missing You,"This might seem odd, but literally nothing. I find this streaming era superior in every way from binging, to no commercials, it could not come soon enough"
Missing You,I miss having to run to the bathroom between every commercial of a show or movie without wanting to miss anything
Missing You,"Nothing!  I never liked broadcast television and streaming is slowly turning into, On-Demand Broadcast Television, with the ads and the weekly episode release nonsense."
The Twelve Kingdoms,Trailer does not include anyone yelling “SHIELD [long pause] WALL!!”. Deeply concerned.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Uthred son of Uthred is a great character. 

I am really looking forward to this. In my opinion, this was the best show dealing with Viking theme."
The Twelve Kingdoms,So hyped for more Uhtred son of Uhtred
The Twelve Kingdoms,I am Uhtred son of Uhtred
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Fuck yes.  I finally got around to watching the final season of The Last Kingdom over the past couple of weeks, so it must be... *destiny* that this is coming soon."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"One of my favorite shows of all time, really looking forward to this. Destiny is all!"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Anybody misread the title as Stephen King must die?
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Trailer needed more Finan, but excited nonetheless."
The Twelve Kingdoms,The modern day James Bond. Every season begins or ends with his previous missus dying and him immediately shacking up with a new lady. Be hard pressed to fit that cycle into a 2 hour movie.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"well, that's a lot of kings to assassinate"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Uthred the Ageless - outlived young Edward.

Pretty hyped tho, ngl"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Best Viking show/movie I’ve ever seen
The Twelve Kingdoms,I was disappointed with the final season but I’m excited to see this
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Also astonishing how many can't read 

Maybe not so surprising in a tv sub tho"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Used to be one of my favorite shows till season 3. But season 4 made me lose all interest and killed my love for it. Did it get any better afterwards?
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Anyone else read the title at first glance as, ""Steven King Must Die""?"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Anybody else misread the title as ""Buttvirgins #24""?"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Another one of  the ""everyone in medieval time wore brown or black, even the noble´s, it,s dark and  muddy and whitewash for walls surely is a 21th century invention"" style movies.

This one with a unique new angle of "" i may be wearing a bearskin cloak and a warriors haircut and still can´t afford any nicely made clothes but i just REALLY like expressive eye make up."""
The Twelve Kingdoms,Yes! One of my all time favorites Shows! Destiny is all!
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I read this as Steve King’s Must Die — The Last Kingdom sequel — and was simultaneously confused and excited. I’m a bit let down, but still excited to see Uhtred son of Uhtred."
The Twelve Kingdoms,It is my destiny to watch this.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I know it's good but I just don't have the time to watch The Last Kingdom. So my question is, do you guys think I can watch this without watching the series? Can the story stand alone?"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Ahh. 

Was hoping it wouldn't be him vs uthred after rewatch recently..but of course"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"At first very brief glance I thought it said 'Steven King Must Die' and was like hm, what's all this? 
(Yes I know it's Stephen, that's just what my brain initially did)"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"It''s not cinema movie, right?"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Thought this said Stephen King Must Die
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Uthred son of Uthred son of Uthred son of Uthred!

Destiny is all"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Wyrd bið ful aræd.
The Twelve Kingdoms,How was thr final season? I got rather bored 4 episodes in to the last season. Did it get better
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I can't help but think of the railway station in London. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven\_Kings"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"
No but I’d watch that too"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Not really, it sort of just found its level and stayed around that for the most part."
The Twelve Kingdoms,I did!
The Twelve Kingdoms,The show doesn't make any claims to be historically accurate
The Twelve Kingdoms,Probably but you’ll regret it.
The Twelve Kingdoms,Fate is inexorable
The Twelve Kingdoms,Uthred of Bababba
The Twelve Kingdoms,Yes the nostalgia!
The Twelve Kingdoms,You forgot Uhtred brother of Uhtred.
The Twelve Kingdoms,[deleted]
The Twelve Kingdoms,"same, last thing i remember is there being a huge plague plotline right in the beginning of covid lol"
The Twelve Kingdoms,I see. That's a shame. Was one of the best shows around in its first three seasons.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Im not really criticising that. Even if it looks like , i will give you that.

It´s just lazy filmmaking. Apparently film people think this drab boring costume and prop stuff has been conditioned onto the audience and they can get away with it. Probably way cheaper than paying some guys to design and make some nice looking stuff.

Any basic bbc history documentation has better looking costumes and set."
The Twelve Kingdoms,Did 5 get better? I watched 4 episodes and was bored. The original magic seemed gone
The Twelve Kingdoms,"The action felt better than GoT at times. Writing and acting was obviously a long way distant, but as a show I preferred it to GoT S4+"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Who knows why Hollywood decides to do what it does. My theory is the producers think it looks cooler haha
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Respect for them choosing to stick to their plans and actually use the real names of known nobility, rulers, and clergy of the era. 

Mostly I respect that because every third person is named Æthel_____. Any sane production would have subbed 90% of those names out. But they had a roadmap and stuck to it, and it actually worked."
The Twelve Kingdoms,I liked this show very much.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"> underrated

Five seasons and a movie on the way."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Was pleasantly surprised at how good that series proved to be. Could never get into *Vikings*, which I could never understand because I absolutely **devoured** *Black Sails*, and the two are similar in many ways. Somehow, series like *The Last Kingdom* and *Black Sails* dealt with themes and characters I found more appealing. 

That said, *The Last Kingdom* is **good** from the outset, but personally I believe it doesn't become **great** until the introduction of characters like Finan, and the loyal retinue that slowly begins to form around Uhtred. 

For some reason, I remember thinking that a character like Uhtred and his development would have been a great template for Star Wars in the writing of a character like Anakin Skywalker. The emphasis on identity, on Uhtred's lifelong resentment of having his home and family taken from him, on his development from a solo warrior only interested in his own interests into a leader whose bravery and personality inspires loyalty, and especially how the series handles the tragic love that forms between >!Uhtred and Aethelflaed!<; all while remaining a genuinely funny, likeable person. It's a difficult tonal balance to strike, and I think the series deserves more credit for the fantastic job it does. 

The only real issue (if you can call it that) is how it suffers from *X-Men First Class*\-disorder, with regards to the passage of time and inconsistency of how certain characters age over five seasons. Characters grow old and die, children grow into adulthood, while others never seem to age a day; Uhtred himself lives what feels like several lifetimes, and only appears to have changed stylists (probably because the first one grew old and died)."
The Twelve Kingdoms,They better throw Uthred some grey hair dye for the movie at least.
The Twelve Kingdoms,I love this show. Can't wait for the movie.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"It's full of good characters and one my favorite recent series. I stumbled on it and it had already 4 seasons, then I had the privilege to witness the fifth. Not a single boring episode comes to mind.

Leofric was a obviously a funny character. My favorite however was maybe Alfred for how well he was played. It's been a while so I have forgotten characters no doubt so it's difficult to say who would be a favorite. Beocca has charisma for sure.

Most of the viking characters were interesting as well. Except some female characters I didn't care too much for.

One thing to complain about is the age thing. Gotta just accept it."
The Twelve Kingdoms,[deleted]
The Twelve Kingdoms,"""There's a ransom for your head!""

""I have a very small head""

My favorite line of his."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"It had 5 seasons and a movie coming, I wouldn’t say it’s underrated but it has its *niche*. It’s all great show with some great characters"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Pretty good, but never understood why Uhtred kept serving the Christian king guy who kept dicking him over at every turn"
The Twelve Kingdoms,second this💯💯
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I loved it until season 5, had to drop it about three episodes in as brida ruined it for me."
The Twelve Kingdoms,Nothing's more satisfying than a main character who does exactly what you want him to do.
The Twelve Kingdoms,Anything that gets people to look into Saint Alfred the Great more is well worth it.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"The first season can be difficult for people to get into, due to how quick the pacing can be, and how many years pass in this season.

The show is absolutely worth it for the drama, and definitely the action. Some of the most fun action scenes in a show. Tense moments and thriller.

Very highly recommend this show. 110% recommend this show."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Books are great. TV show is worse, with poor main actor casting choice. It's watchable, but not great.

If you want great, watch Andor."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"The show diverges from the books quite a bit by the end, but it is very entertaining and well done. Looking forward to the movie."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"""Only two seasons in""

Lucky you. Season 3 is one of my favorite seasons of anything ever."
The Twelve Kingdoms,I enjoyed it. I still think they (and Cornwell) wasted Æthelflæd.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Don't have wifi, it was on Syfy channel. The first four seasons which I loved. I hope the Syfy channel will show season 5 also, even at 6:00 in the morning. Please put it on regular TV. Movie too!"
The Twelve Kingdoms,The only Aethel names character I hate so much is Aethelred I hope he dies.
The Twelve Kingdoms,Which characters were your favorites? Hild is such a badass warrior nun!
The Twelve Kingdoms,Father Beocca is one of my favorite character do you have any personal favorites?
The Twelve Kingdoms,Who are your favorite characters?
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Seriously, the actor who played Alfred was awesome. I'd love to see him in more stuff."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"That makes a lot more sense in a world where he's virtually never ""one of you,"" so he's always sort of an outsider even if he's super useful and fairly kind. All in English and from a modern perspective it's a bit more silly, since why would you not want to keep this guy as an ally? He's a main character!"
The Twelve Kingdoms,Is that scene after season 2? I don’t think I remember that scene.
The Twelve Kingdoms,[deleted]
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I lost it when I learned that they title their children who are designated heirs, Ætheling."
The Twelve Kingdoms,Aethelred does some decent things over the course of the show : that's one of the things I like about The Last Kingdom - very few characters are either wholly good or wholly bad.
The Twelve Kingdoms,Baby monk. Actually all of Uthreds boys
The Twelve Kingdoms,Not sure I had a single favorite. Many of the villains were super memorable though!
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Leofric of course.

""Get out here arseling before I crush your irishman!"""
The Twelve Kingdoms,I can't spell most of their names but Uhtred and Father Beoca are definitely up there.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I haven't watched it in a while, but yeah, I think it's season 4?"
The Twelve Kingdoms,">I think it was his relationship with Alfred that made it as compelling as it was.

Absolutely. 

It's a bit like after >!Athelstan!< died in Vikings. I still enjoyed the show because of Ragnar but their relationship took it to another level for me."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Yeah, he's a major cunt but at times in battle he's fairly valiant and leads well.

It's not hard to see why he was selected as a potential match for Aethelflaed, he's just a cruel wanker with a seriously fragile ego."
The Twelve Kingdoms,He’s now Aemond Targaryen in House of the Dragon.
The Twelve Kingdoms,Loved him and Uhtreds friendship hated how he dies too early. I did see that he’s credited for a later episode no idea what thats about.
The Twelve Kingdoms,Love Hild and Uhtreds sister and brother relationship!
The Twelve Kingdoms,Holy shit I hadn't made that connection yet! Thats cool
The Twelve Kingdoms,"His death was so, so lame.  I was almost impressed with how lame it was."
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Not sure what it is about this show. Like I wanted to like it, and 5 episodes in I just don't care at all. The premise is interesting, and it's well acted, but I just can't get into it. I get the impression my wife feels similarly. 

The other night I dropped the ""I think I'm good on this show. Feel free to forge ahead without me if you'd like.""

Her response was something to the effect of, ""Eh. Maybe."""
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I don't really get why there's such a gap between appearing in the US and then ending up on Disney Plus in the UK. When you can get the same stuff immediately on Netflix, Amazon, Apple, etc it's just annoying."
The Twelve Kingdoms,The show started great but now I can't wait for it to be over.
The Twelve Kingdoms,One of the biggest recent “bad show that could’ve been an okay movie” offenders.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Seriously at this point I dont care anymore, I just pirate hulu shows because I'm paying for disney anyways and when those shows finally come to my country all the buzz has died..."
The Twelve Kingdoms,Liking this show.
The Twelve Kingdoms,I didn’t really care for the show.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Oh boy, UK, get ready to be whelmed!"
The Twelve Kingdoms,This show sucks.
The Twelve Kingdoms,"Idk why everyone on this thread hates the show, I haven't heard anything bad about it before. My boyfriend and I have been really liking it and excited to see the finale. It's unique, introspective and fascinating"
The Twelve Kingdoms,"I am really enjoying this show.  Just wish the episodes were longer!  I like that it isn't just about the therapist trying to talk down a serial killer, but they delve into his own thorny family issues."
Real Rob,"*This summer Rob Schneider is Rob Schneider!*

It was bound to come full circle eventually."
Real Rob,That trailer had a lot of vibrantly blue eyes.
Real Rob,This could either be absolutely obnoxious or super self-aware and incredible. I'm hoping for the latter. 
Real Rob,"I can't stand Rob Schneider and this looks like a Curb Your Enthusiasm knock off.

However it's on Netflix and with their track record it at least deserves a chance."
Real Rob,"There's something about the way this is shot or lit or something, it makes everyone look so bright and blue-eyed and tanned.

Anyway I think I'll give it a chance, why not? "
Real Rob,Can't wait. Netflix got so many new original content. Just finished Master of None and currently binging Jessica Jones.
Real Rob,Rated PG-13.
Real Rob,"""The gayest of all phobias""?  What does that even mean?!"
Real Rob,Hard pass. 
Real Rob,Looks like a lot of cameos
Real Rob,"I will go into this show with an open mind, it could be great."
Real Rob,"Based on other things he's done like !ROB! I wanted to hate it, but the trailer made me laugh, so I'll he checking it out. "
Real Rob,Did he have a sitcom where he lived with a Mexican family or something or was that Adam Sandler.
Real Rob,"I find the show funny.  Everybody likes to hate on rob,  but I like him. "
Real Rob,"Why? God, why?"
Real Rob,"I like rob, his mannerisms are so quirky, i love it. "
Real Rob,This looks like the most masturbatory vanity project in the history of Western cinema.
Real Rob,"Well, it's different at least."
Real Rob,This feels like a normal sitcom. It is not dark or off beat like the rest of Netflix shows.
Real Rob,"I don't know why I'm mentioning this here, since it has nothing to do with the actual show, but did you know that Rob Schneider's daughter is musician Elle King?"
Real Rob,"I'm watching it currently and honestly, I was expecting something worse. It's not THAT bad, I can't stand his wife's acting though."
Real Rob,Such a blessing to be blessed with this from the great Rob Schneider.﻿
Real Rob,"Yikes. There's a reason why these people don't work anymore, Netflix.

Why Rob Schneider? Was Carrot Top busy? Was Pauly Shore out of town? The deal fall through on Gallagher's high-stakes cop drama?

What the fuck."
Real Rob,Looks like a failed pilot shot and released on youtube by pretty good film school students. 
Real Rob,"[Rob Schneider Derp da Derp, Derp da derpity derp da derp. Until one day...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFLuIn6lj5g)"
Real Rob,Nicely played
Real Rob,Norm Macdonald especially. 
Real Rob,Does anyone actually want to take selfies with Rob Schneider?  Does anyone even know who Rob Schneider is any more?  I think its going to be very obnoxious and self centered.
Real Rob,Im watching it now. Its very self aware but also silghtly obnoxious. I give it a 7or 8 out of 10 so far. Its worth watching but its not amazing. 
Real Rob,No one forced you bruh
Real Rob,The lighting kinda makes it look like a disney channel show. Weird
Real Rob,"Is Jessica Jones better than, worse than, or as good as The Flash? "
Real Rob,"The same thing seeing Norm Macdonald, David Spade, and George Lopez means - Rob Schneider wishes it was still 2002"
Real Rob,*H∀rd pass
Real Rob,I take it you've never seen Glitter. 
Real Rob,"Netflix is not a one trick pony, they are allowed to make different things y'know"
Real Rob,I would take a selfie with Rob Schneider... Who wouldn't want to take a selfie with Big Stan?
Real Rob,"You hit the nail on the head. It's self-absorbed nonsense. It's a shame to see something fail so badly. If that show is Rob Schneider's take on the world, it would really say a lot about him. *A lot*."
Real Rob,"It's tough to say because they're so different. Imo, Flash is the ultimate comic book show. It's unapologetic in how schlocky it gets with its content. It's clearly made by fans who just want to please other fans and create new ones. It's also more bright, cheerful, but has deep and layered characters.

Jessica Jones is a heavy show. It manages to incorporate some humor (more than Daredevil, at least), but when it gets dark, it gets *dark.* It's more realistic, all the characters in it feel more like real people than they do in the Flash (where everyone acts like they're in a comic book). And it has the most fucked up and, imo again, best villain out of any comic book show. 

So I guess it's all a matter of what you prefer. I'm loving the shit out of JJ and binged the first five episodes back to back, but at the same time the Flash is the first show I watch when I catch up on my DVR every week."
Real Rob,I don't watch The Flash so i have no way to compare them. 
Real Rob,[deleted]
Real Rob,"Dude when did I say they are? It is just an observation, how did you read that as a criticism?"
Real Rob,We'll talk about in a couple weeks once you've watched The Flash and I've watched Jessica Jones. 
Real Rob,It's actually surprisingly really good. I was sceptical but once I got into it I was hooked.
Real Rob,"I remember the reaction to the first season being pretty poor, but it's really the first time I ever found Rob funny. Smoothie drinking career obsessed narcissist with a condescending wife worked great for him.

Hopefully season 2 is as good or better."
Real Rob,I completely forgot about this show. Thought it was cancelled
Real Rob,[The Coffee Shop bit was great too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhXQrIAzkpk)
Real Rob,I thought it was surprisingly good.
Real Rob,"""Tipping is all about income ratio disparity.""

...

""Where am I, in Norway right now?""

Definitely going to check this out!"
Real Rob,It's pretty weak and he's still unlikeable. Belongs on TBS
Real Rob,"His wife is smoking.

It was a poor, very poor man's Curb.

I found out his daughter sings that Xs and Os song though."
Real Rob,It was weird. The first episode they play it like he's just the unlucky guy that has bad shit happen to him. By the second episode he makes you regret any sympathy you gave him by being a complete asshole. His wife is the best part of the show. Norms cameo was fucking hilarious. I recommend everyone at least watch that scene.
Real Rob,"I watched a few episodes.  I was curious what Schneider would do with a show he had control over.  I didn't like it.

*Real Rob* tried to do a lot of things that successful sitcoms have done.  It was a parody of his real life, like *Curb Your Enthusiasm* and *Louie*.  It centered around cringe comedy, again like *Curb* and *Louie*.  Bits of Schneider's stand-up were interjected into each episode, like *Seinfeld*.  *And* it had random interview segments, like *The Office* and *Modern Family*.

It handled all of these things poorly.  

For example, one of the many things that made *Curb Your Enthusiasm* great is the trouble Larry would get into.  These situations were all silly, sometimes crazy, but they were all grounded in just the right amount of reality.  They were relatable.  I think it was the very first episode of *Curb* in which Larry got into an awkward situation because the crotch of his pants made it look like he had a constant erection.  That shit has happened to me, which is why I thought it was funny.  Not only that, but here you have a show about the personal life of one of the millionaire co-creators of one of the most popular sitcoms ever, and the very first scene is of that millionaire staring at his crotch and complaining to his wife.  That made me - and I imagine many others - like the character and the show immediately.

In one of the very first scenes of *Real Rob*, Schneider flew into LAX.  As he exited baggage claim, he was accosted by a fan who wanted him to sign some bootleg DVDs of *Deuce Bigalow* or something.  This was not a random celebrity encounter; the dude clearly knew when Schneider was arriving at LAX. How does this fan know what Schneider's travel schedule is?  Not only was this scene not relatable, it also wasn't believable.

As if that wasn't enough, the main plot of that episode centered around Schneider turning his stalker into his personal assistant.  So this episode starts with him getting annoyed by one random fan, and then stalked by a different fan.  It made the episode seem really self-aggrandizing, something that the other ""based on a comedian's real life"" TV shows somehow managed to avoid.

If anything, the show was fun to nitpick.
"
Real Rob,Watched about 10 minutes of it. I like him but it didn't hook me at all.
Real Rob,"I saw the first episode. The plot wasn't bad (he fires his manager, and replaces him with his stalker, who does a much better job). Most of the jokes fell flat though. I think it could've been more self depreciating "
Real Rob,I watched one episode.  Not good 
Real Rob,"I don't know if  it was serious or not. I took it as a joke and just enjoyed a silly show about Rob. I feel it was maybe not a joke, which in turn makes it better now that I'm thinking about it haha"
Real Rob,"I hated the entire show. Both him and his wife are equally annoying. I didn't want to watch it but my bf put it on. I can say he shouldn't of made that show. I guess they are made for each other though since they were both were cringy and disrespectful to each other. Plus he treated his assistant like crap. If it's satire, still wasn't a good look."
Real Rob,">SORKIN: We shot the service at the National Cathedral, and during rehearsals there were a number of clergy standing around watching. I walked up to a priest who was standing nearby and said, ""Excuse me, Father? I think you should know that in the scene we're about to do Martin Sheen is going to curse at God."" He smiled and said, ""I know, it's gonna be great."""
Real Rob,The dialogue in this show was prime Sorkin. Helped that he had an absolute all-star cast to work with. Another sign of how masterfully it was made is that it felt less preachy as a show based on politics than  many non-political shows that interject political/social commentary in much lower quantities.
Real Rob,One of the greatest shows of all time. Atleast the first 4 seasons.
Real Rob,"Man, this has given me the desire to start yet another full rewatch."
Real Rob,"Still one of my very favourite shows. There's been nothing as good since IMO. Madam Secretary is close, but still a bit short. The cast and the writing are both amazing. Thanks for the link."
Real Rob,I'd kill for a revival with maybe Sam or Josh as President (with Sorkin involved as well)
Real Rob,I feel better that I’m not alone in thinking Toby got screwed in the end.
Real Rob,And.... Starting the rewatch.
Real Rob,This article is over 5 years old.
Real Rob,I just don’t believe that was in Toby character.
Real Rob,"firstly, if you haven't already, give this a listen if you're into podcasts  
[http://thewestwingweekly.com/](http://thewestwingweekly.com/)

&#x200B;

They're doing season 7 now, but a specific item that they establish early is ""Trump Aye-aye-aye"", where they compare the political norms of the episode of the show to the current state of politics. It's not an every episode thing, but it is a stark contrast."
Real Rob,I just named my pug puppy Josh Lyman. You can guess why.
Real Rob,"Good show from an entertainment and production standpoint, with an absolutely poisonous effect on reality.

https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-51-how-the-west-wing-poisoned-the-liberalmind"
Real Rob,"Worst show *EVER.* The people who get into politics are only attracted by the power. I happened to be surfing channels when the ""feckless thug"" speech happened. I laughed out loud. Libertarians  were playing hardball while feckless dems were eating this shit. Still are.

Edit. Downvote me to hell. DT is  your President. Thanks Sorkinsists. Walk and talk works, right?"
Real Rob,I knew it but no one believed me oh they said I was crazy hahaha but I kept telling people but oh no you're wrong oh I shall have the last laugh
Real Rob,[removed]
Real Rob,That scene for me was the best ever in television. The music was so haunting too.
Real Rob,"This makes me so happy for some reason, and I don't know why."
Real Rob,[this one](https://youtu.be/dVgK5HKj3P4)
Real Rob,"God damnit, now I have to watch that and then I’ll end up watching all four seasons of the show."
Real Rob,"It did a good job of preaching without feeling preachy unlike the Newsroom, which was Sorkin's vision of an ideal Republican in the same way that WW was ideal Democrats."
Real Rob,Madam Secretary is not even in the same league lol
Real Rob,"I  also like the Danish political drama Borgen -- it isn't  overly preachy and the people are realistic instead of optimistic, which makes it feel different from TWW but retains the detail and policy making depth."
Real Rob,"Depends on what you want

Nothing as good if you restrict yourself to optimistic politicial shows

The Wire is as good but pessimistic

Also The Good wife which is more cynical and filled with characters of grey morality"
Real Rob,"No. The best would be ""The Supremes"". A ""younger\controversial"" person surprisingly  elected to  supreme  court justice, battling   stalwart  dogma.

Sorking would need someone to cooperate, and to complement him as he can get a bit too playwrighty otherwise .


But also, Sorking needs someone to reel him back a little bit, and a grand setting enough to justify his dialogue.

It would be epic (if he got enough  time to write each episode)"
Real Rob,"I personally think a Josh as president revival would be great. Sam is a little more expected, plus I don’t know if you could get Rob Lowe to do it. And I think a president Lyman would be different enough from president Bartlet that it’s be interesting. Plus I have a huge crush on Bradley Whitford which may be influencing my opinion."
Real Rob,"Josh for President.  C.J. is his VP.  Charlie chief of staff. Sam Attorney General.  And while I know Donna felt like her and Josh needed to work a part so she could be separate from him... she’d make one hell of a Deputy Chief of Staff.  I’d also want Ainsley back. 

Not sure where Toby would fit in, but I’d want him on. I’m still pissed about what happened with him in the last season. 

I have a longer list, but my cell is about to die.  Lol"
Real Rob,"Honestly..I don't think Sorkin can do it.   


I'm gonna cite The Newsroom. The first episode was fantastic, then the second it dropped almost immediately into mediocrity in an attempt to show ""both sides"" of issues where one side was usually pure bigotry and ignorance. And while it was a more modern reflection than West Wing was, it got old quickly.  


If he could return to the sort of more ideal stance to give people an actual escape from our current, sordid reality, then I'd want to see a new show in the West Wing universe. And I admit, I don't know how much of that decay was Sorkin's writing vs possible executive meddling, but I worry that it would become a slog as they tried to make it ""relevant"" and we end up seeing even more stupidity normalized than we already have.  


I may be jaded though."
Real Rob,"Would be so awesome

Politics feels so different now though...I wonder if a show written with the same tone could work these days"
Real Rob,"West Wing Weekly is up to those very episodes and last week or so interviewed Richard Schiff on the topic. He wasn't pleased with it either. I'm in the camp that it was out of character, and Schiff intones that the writing may have been retaliatory in nature as the actor and the character were pretty in sync and there had been some friction with the writers shortly before that plotline gestated."
Real Rob,"I didn't know that had happened until today.  I stopped when they made Leo quit the staff.  (After Bartlet for America, I just couldn't imagine it)."
Real Rob,Unless something better has come up since....it's all we got.
Real Rob,"“I’m going to criticize the show without having understood the context.”

What’s your idea of libertarian hardball? Johnson giving an interview where he’s talking with his tongue sticking out?"
Real Rob,"""I happened to be surfing through channels"" is the same excuse Don the Con uses when he wants to yell at CNN but doesn't want to let his supporters know he watches CNN all day."
Real Rob,"True libertarians barely exist anywhere in government, so whatever ""hardball"" they are playing doesn't seem to be working."
Real Rob,... eh?

Real Rob,"I can't take him yelling in Latin seriously. It's too much, even for sorkin."
Real Rob,It's humanizing and leveling. It's the same reason I get a kick out of the image of Anthony Hopkins watching Breaking Bad or The Queen watching Twin Peaks back in the 90s.
Real Rob,They likely knew it was going to be a cathartic moment for a character. And I’m betting any dedicated priest themselves have had those crisis of faith moments where you just want to yell at God for being a “real son of a bitch” and a “feckless thug.”
The Haunted Hathaways,"You can say it's extremely outdated and cheesy because well, it is,

but something about those disembodied heads floating around in the background as Carly Beth tries to unlock the door fast enough always gets me to this day."
The Haunted Hathaways,"Love goosebumps the best memories reading them and watching the show, I still throw them on in the background now for noise while tinkering.
 
I didn't realize this as a kid but there's a ton of times that the actors' Canadian accents drop because the show was filmed in Canada. Also Ryan gosling was in the say cheese and die episode"
The Haunted Hathaways,"They used to play this every year around Halloween at school, and it scared the shit out of me. The idea of a mask stuck on your face and increasingly bonding itself to your skin is scary even now"

Carly Beth's duck walk."
The Haunted Hathaways,Disney is making a new series. I have low hopes of it being as good as the original. Especially with the details given.
The Haunted Hathaways,This is the exact one that has always stuck with me. Just absolutely terrifying as a kid.
The Haunted Hathaways,ERMAGHERD GERSBERMS!
The Haunted Hathaways,"I host a weekly podcast about growing up in the 90s, and we had a TON of fun talking about goosebumps, and this episode in particular:

https://generations.buzzsprout.com/2024899/11432565-goosebumps"
The Haunted Hathaways,"During the intro as a kid I would close my eyes and plug my ears when the dogs eyes would turn yellow and woof to the tune of the song.  

The show was no problem for me but that part of the intro fucked me all the way up"
The Haunted Hathaways,"I’m so glad you said that lol, I feel the same way. They scared the shit out of me as a kid, and they scare the shit out of me as a grown man."
The Haunted Hathaways,Werewolf of fever swamp was terrifying
The Haunted Hathaways,"Loved Goosebumps as a kid the books and the show, none of them really scared me but that episode had me scared for months lol"
The Haunted Hathaways,As a kid I noticed that they freeze framed the dog during that shot. You can see someone in the background walking who just freezes in place.
The Haunted Hathaways,"When I was a kid I would rent the vhs taped from blockbuster, they'd have 2 episodes on one VHS but the credits would still after the first but before the 2nd episode started.

It would scare me hearing the music come on and seeing the green ooze slide down the screen because my older siblings told me if you wait till the ooze reaches the bottom of the screen, slappy jump scares you so I always closed my eyes at the end credits.


Also I thought the model on the billboard that morphs was Michael Jackson for some reason"
The Haunted Hathaways,"I have a picture of the dog’s head photoshopped on a rapper’s body of him recording his verse in the studio.

It is my favorite pic and I would love to share it, but I have no link!!!"
The Haunted Hathaways,I love weird childhood memories.
The Haunted Hathaways,"Love both of these so much. Their chemistry was off the charts in Bly Manor, funny to think about how it was gonna be a straight couple originally with Oliver Jackson Cohen playing the gardener. The show doesn’t get enough love. 

Genuine romance stories in genre settings in general need to be done more."
The Haunted Hathaways,Who really finds being gay or lesbian strange anymore?
The Haunted Hathaways,The Last of Us really managed to pack an emotional gut punch into that episode.
The Haunted Hathaways,I just wish it had a graphic docking scene

The Haunted Hathaways,"Lots and lots of people, sadly."

The Haunted Hathaways,"I tried to watch ep 3 with my neighbor and he refused to watch ""zombie brokeback mountain"" and made me skip most of the episode because it bothered him that much. I had already seen it so I just sat there and just made fun of him for it.

 Lol"
The Haunted Hathaways,"Do you see the news in the U.S?

Many people unfortunately. Same in the rest of the world.."
The Haunted Hathaways,Unfortunately a massive % of the population of the US.
The Haunted Hathaways,About 35% of Americans and billions elsewhere.
The Haunted Hathaways,"Sadly, about 98% of the Neanderthals I work with in the warehouse.

Absolutely disgusting, the shit I gotta hear said sometimes. I got one coworker who still believes there are litter boxes for Furries in High Schools and believes being gay is just some disgusting choice sexual deviants choose to engage in.  Oh yes, every gradeschool teacher that's not a straight white person is ""Doing CRT to groom the kids to become gays!""--I wish this were a made up quote......

2 of them were stunlocked by the revelation that I am 1/2 Jewish.  Like, they're fused to believe it.

The Midwest is still a dumpsterfire outside of major population centers.....and even some of those are not great."

The Haunted Hathaways,"Yes, on HBO. Three episodes in so far"
The Haunted Hathaways,Have you been trapped under a rock or in a coma?
The Haunted Hathaways,Unfortunately I think you're giving the western world a little too much credit too.
The Haunted Hathaways,"My mom is the same, but she watched the episode and cried and said it was her favorite so far. I didn’t really push her on anything and I hope maybe in her mind she’s slowly becoming more accepting."
The Haunted Hathaways,"Your mum is gross :(





I meant her views make her gross, in case that isn't clear lol"
The Haunted Hathaways,IMDb has been review bombed so much user ratings are meaningless

The Haunted Hathaways,It’s why these stories are important.

The Haunted Hathaways,"When Margaret Atwood wrote the book, she did not imagine the dystopian by herself, it’s a mash up of horrors that already happened (the Ceaușescu’s Romanian regime, the People of Hope cult, the lead in gasoline and much more). It seems like as human we are so fucking dumb that we make the same errors again and again, swearing we will not let this happen again and here we are with theocratic fascist gaining their way to the power again. It hits close to home because it already happened and apparently we will let it happen again."

The Haunted Hathaways,"Idiots need to stop comparing every political issue to “A handmaids tale” and “Harry Potter.” You’re 37 years old, read a goddamn newspaper, it’s the real world not some hogwarts bullshit."

Invitro procedures I guess are also on the table.   A few reasons.   My son was born ( premie mind you) via this process.   I miss-carried his twin.   We call her Danielle.    What if I, at 40 had 6 viable embryos?   No way anyone, mother or fetus’s could survive.   Is this law going to monitor this procedure?    
Good news is my 22 year old born premie, now T1D, at 22 wants to write legislation for peoples rights. 
Are these knuckleheads and this ruling coming after IVF?    It seems so.    
Absolutely frightening!!!
To clarify,  prior to my sons viable birth I miscarried twice before."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I figured he wasn't dead since Kilgrave in the comics does have a healing factor but I didn't expect to return so soon or for them to be this open with it.


Maybe it'll just be flashbacks."
Marvels Jessica Jones,The hand could bring him back with the thing that resurrected Elektra.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"motherfucker you died.

i hope its flashbacks.

edit: to those who have not watched jessica jones 1st season, i'm sorry if this is a spoiler. but why are you reading this thread about season two? its obviously gonna have some spoilers. now go watch the first season.




now. before the defenders comes next week."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"OK a lot of of people clearly missed something in the show, so let me try to make a couple things clear. 

Zebediah Kilgrave (the character in the comics) has a healing factor. 

The version of Kilgrave in the show is a bit different. Kevin Thompson (Kilgrave) was born with a neurodegenerative disease. His parents experimented on him by injecting stem cells into his spinal cord. This healed his disease and regenerated his spinal cord as intended, but also gave him his powers. Unbeknownst, it also bestowed a healing factor to his spinal cord. 

When Jessica goes to the doctor who treated Kilgrave following the bus crash, it's explained that he was called for a spinal injury/possible paralysis, but when the patient (Kilgrave) showed up on the ambulance, he just had two destroyed kidneys. (Kilgrave's spinal cord had already healed itself, bu they chalked it up to a miscommunication among first responders). 

In the later part of the series, they collect stem cells from Kilgrave's fetus, and inject them into Kilgrave again, making his powers exponentially stronger, turning his skin purple. It can be assumed that this also increased his spinal regenerative abilities. 

In the end of the show, JJ snaps his neck, an injury he's now fully capable of healing from. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,[EW Exclusive Image of Kilgrave & Jessica](http://imgur.com/vQ4mHSK)
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I agree with others that it would be bad for Jessica's character arc if he's still alive, but that said, if he is alive, a thing I think would be interesting is if he's alive but paralyzed. The juxtaposition of him having complete control over other people but no control over his own body would be interesting. Maybe even have him somehow end up like Bullseye did in the comics, alive, but paralyzed, deaf, and blind, trapped in his own body."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Could be flashbacks; they've already been seen filming some. Could be hallucinations; she was already sort of seeing him before his first real appearance in the first season and killing him doesn't end the trauma, especially not after seeing that bloodbath he left in his wake.

I wouldn't be surprised if he did come back though. I can't completely believe someone is dead in a super hero show/comic/movie unless they are definitely, no outs, totally dead (and even then....). Breaking someones neck then walking away doesn't cut it. Doesn't help the Netflix shows have resurrection/immortality on the table either."
Marvels Jessica Jones,Jesssssssssicaaaa
Marvels Jessica Jones,The Hand might have revived him. Fuck the Hand.
Marvels Jessica Jones,I love how this is tagged spoiler when the spoiler is in the fucking title
Marvels Jessica Jones,"There's a rumor Killgrave's mind will now be uploaded into the body of an animporhic duck who will still retain the same powers he had in season 1, but with the occasional quack. Sweet Christmas!"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I don't care, bring him the fuck back.

Jessica jones is a 7/10 show that became a 9/10 show only because of david tennent imo.

Fisk,killgrave and cottenmouth all heavily carried their shows from above-average to fantastic, which is why when the focus becomes less on cottonmouth towards the end, luke cage goes to shit."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"YEEEEES!

HE WAS SO GOOD IN THAT SHOW!

I WAS KINDA SAD WHEN HE DIED BECAUSE IT MESNT NO MORE.

This news gets a ten out if Tennant."
Marvels Jessica Jones,Maybe he went to Tahiti.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Fuuuck yes, literally five minutes ago finished rewatching JJ in preparation for Defenders. I've said to my friends I hope he's still alive, even if he's disabled and incapable of speech (Similar to King's Mr Mercedes trilogy) and Jessica visits him sometimes like Hannibal Lecter or similar."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Very, very much doubt that he's coming back to life since that would be detrimental to Jessica's character arc, while also being a huge ass pull.

Yes, he was able to do it in the comics, but even then it was an ass pull. Also, no, he probably won't be revived by The Hand since they will very likely be defeated for good (Thank God) in ***The Defenders*** and we'll hopefully not have to deal with their boring ass organization again.

Likely scenario is that he will appear in more ""real"" panic attacks or nightmares that Jessica has throughout this season.

Can't imagine snapping his neck would cure her of her PTSD. They'd probably just make them worse. 

I mean. She already thought he died once."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Kilgrave: Hiii... There...


Death: Oh hi, uh, Kilgrave right? I should know, we have a whole wing down here named after you.


Killgrave: Yeah, where am I exactly?


Death: Don't you get it, you're dead


Kilgrave: No, I don't think so.


Death: What?!


Kilgrave: I'm not dead, I'm alive. Make me alive again.


Death: ""snaps fingers"" Yes!"
Marvels Jessica Jones,Tell that to Zod's snapped neck!
Marvels Jessica Jones,I was hoping that Kilgrave just mind-controlled Jessica to *think* she killed him just to get her off his tail.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"To everyone reporting this post and complaining that this is a spoiler: Casting news does not violate our spoiler rules. This is publicly announced casting carried on a major TV news site, and you don't know in what capacity he will appear in the new season, so let's all calm down?

I marked the thread as a spoiler just in case someone who hasn't seen Jessica Jones season 1 stumbles upon this, but otherwise this is fair game."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I'm not surprised at all. It's David Tennant, they were definitely gonna try and get him back. Maybe a further form of more PTSD but I hope that doesn't feel too redundant. Considering the quality of Jessica Jones I'm sure it'll be great however they manage to do it."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Hope he's only in flashbacks. I really liked that the season had closure. I don't really want to see ""he's baaaaack!"""
Marvels Jessica Jones,"While David Tennant was by far the best thing about Jessica Jones (and possibly all of the Netflix Marvel series), I hope he stays dead. There can be too much of a good thing."
Marvels Jessica Jones,This entire title is a spoiler.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I'm a simple whovian. I see Tennant, I like. Upvote. Share. I do whatever I can to show the world the glory of this Time Lord.
(No I'm not excessive stop it)"
Marvels Jessica Jones,Why bother tagging this as a spoiler when it is all in the title??? This literally appeared in my feed... ffs
Marvels Jessica Jones,"She was really messed up by that man.  It wouldn't surprise me he still only exists in her head, taunting her, tormenting her.   She has a lot of PTSD she has to work through.

Just because Tennant is back doesn't mean his character is technically alive."
Marvels Jessica Jones,They gonna Arkham Knight him?
Marvels Jessica Jones,Flashbacks.  It's always flashbacks. 
Marvels Jessica Jones,Their interactions were the best part of the show.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Purple Man healing factor please!!! 

(The comic character had a limited healing factor, the end of the season had him boosting his powers it could be possible...)"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"It could definitely be a thing where like, Kilgrave sort of haunts Jessica as she tries to move on from S1 and The Defenders. Marvel is pretty good about showing that being a hero is mentally tough and that they can have PTSD (shit, most of Jessica Jones S1 was about dealing with the trauma of being Killgraved) so I could definitely see Tennant still being involved without the character literally being brought back from the dead"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"am i the only one who was insanely affected by this show? I mean, its amazing, but it really put into perspective how having the superpower of ""do what ever i say"" is down right disgusting/dangerous? 

I mean it could be ritter/tennant were just amazing actors but this show really gave me the creeps. it was disturbing to watch. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Lol after 3 years, all the fans are like ""Get back here Jessica!!"""
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I honestly don't care how, but I'm glad Tennant is back. Even if it's flashbacks, the guy *smashed it* as Kilgrave.   "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Jessica Jones was, by far, the best of the superhero stuff released in the past few years. Most of which ranged from action-packed but meaningless to utter crap. No small part of that success was due to David Tennant."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"That's what every show needs, more Tennant.

Doctor, doctor, doctor!"
Marvels Jessica Jones,Good. He is one of the best Marvel villains. I can't even watch the damn show because what he does to people makes me uncomfortable.
Marvels Jessica Jones,I think instead of flashbacks they will have him as a presence in her head. She will hear his voice now and then and see him here and there. He will show up more and more as she breaks down a bit more.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I have to be honest. Out of Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron Fist, Jessica Jones was the better show. I guess that it's all writing. I'm looking forward to the next season. Also, I love David Tennant.
"
Marvels Jessica Jones,I think that his return in S2 will be a mix of flashback and hallucinations for most of the season and the final punchline to the season will be him returning ready to be the main baddie in season three.
Marvels Jessica Jones,It would be great if he comes back and haunts Jones much like Joker in Arkham Knight. The interaction between Jones and Kilgrave was the best thing in that season.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"As Dr Who right?

Right?"
Marvels Jessica Jones,Good.  His performance was the main reason why the show was watchable.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"SPOILER

No fucking shit"
Marvels Jessica Jones,A return of Jessica Jones' only villain? Quelle surprise!
Marvels Jessica Jones,Blow everyone's mind and bring in Matt Smith instead.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I can only assume he'll be there for flashbacks. If he somehow comes back to life or some horseshit, I'll be pretty disappointed."
Marvels Jessica Jones,Jessica Jones has been by far my favorite of the Marvel shows on Netflix.  Big Tennant fan in general but not sure how this will work into the story.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"If they do resurrect him, I want him to be purple. I don't care how they justify it. Go DBZ with it and say it's a powerup. I just want him to be purple if he comes back. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Hmmm...if they want to hit all the cliches, Season 2 could feature Kilgrave in a lot of PTSD flashbacks, but then have  a ""surprise"" twist at the end showing that he's really alive in, like, a hospital room somewhere, just waiting to come back for real in Season 3."
Marvels Jessica Jones,I really liked him on the first season.  He was such a selfish brat.  Really show Tennant's abilities as an actor to pull off a man who always gets his way and never faces consequences.  He really sold that guy.  
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I'm conflicted.  On one hand, he was my favorite part of season 1.  On the other way, I'm having a hard time imagining a way he comes back in a compelling way that doesn't feel cheap."
Marvels Jessica Jones,It was the long con. She just thought she killed him because he made her think that.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I'm personally hoping for fake-captain-america being a baddie with the syndicate for season 2, with JJ finding out more about the mysterious corporation, leading up to a late game David Tennant and Kingpin meeting leading into a Sinister Six style Defenders 2."
Marvels Jessica Jones,Go face that wall until I tell you you can stop.
Marvels Jessica Jones,Yahhhsss!!! He was 90% of why I loved Jessica Jones! I actually started watching Doctor Who because I loved him as Killgrave.  Then Broadchurch... You get the point.... :)
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Hope he comes back in real time, fucking loved him


Great actor"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Glad he's coming back, one of the best villains in the mcu. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"He is rumored to have only one line of dialogue:
""JESSSICCAAA"""
Marvels Jessica Jones,I really wish they wouldn't make some of these announcements. It would have made a good suprise.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Mahtha. Here's a list of instructions for when I'm human.
One. Don't let me become [The Purple Man]. I hate [The Purple Man]. I don't wanna wake up from being human and being [The Purple Man]."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"YES! He was far and away the best part of season 1, it'd have taken some persuasion to get me to watch season 2 and this looks like it"
Marvels Jessica Jones,The hand revived him probably
Marvels Jessica Jones,"He better, he was the only good part of the show.  Jessica herself really isn't that engaging.  She's kind of an edge Lord (or lady).  ""I'm alcoholic and don't give a fuck, so I'm dark and cool.""  It just felt boring and kind of done before.  Tennant's character made the show, imo.  Hopefully, they can get another good, charismatic villain for season 2.  "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I'm usually pretty sensitive about spoilers, but this headline doesn't bother me. Does he appear in a flashback? A dream sequence? Hallucinogenic vision? Could be anything. This just gets me a little more hyped for this week's release. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I wonder if the practical reason is that the producers read the script, saw the main antagonist, and realized they could never do better than the most creepy villain in superhero history.  

In other words, I am afraid the shark has jumped, just like it did with Daredevil. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Jessica Jones season 2 fascinates me because they're kind of out of her story. They told an analogue of most of her comic history in season 1. Going forward it would require her and Like to get married if they want to keep telling her stories and even then, post season 1 is when she started mattering again outside of being ""wife of Luke Cage and mother to his baby"" and even then that's the crux of the stories told about her."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Maybe the Hand put Purple Man in the Pit, and he's back like a  Meachum."
Marvels Jessica Jones,"They've been filming JJ season 2 for a while now, so most likely he's return coincides with the finale."
Marvels Jessica Jones,He's gonna do voiceover for Jessica's Nightmares.JESSSSSSICKKKKAAA
Marvels Jessica Jones,Best MCU villian ever
Marvels Jessica Jones,I could never complain about more Tennant.
Marvels Jessica Jones,So you're saying he regenerated?
Marvels Jessica Jones,"JESSICA!!!!!


On a serious note, both excited and or frightened to see him back possibly. Too good a actor"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Oh God...as much as I love David Tennant (my all time favorite Doctor), Kilgrave is a terrifying villain. He was absolutely fantastic, probably my favorite villain portrayal I've seen in a while...but downright terrifying. His character gave me the heebie jeebies like no other. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I'm so happy , I was going to stop watching after his death. He's the main reason this show was so good
 "
Marvels Jessica Jones,Kilgrave was such a good part of the show. He was the best villian by far. So much better than 'the Hand'
Marvels Jessica Jones,Maybe he regenerated
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Why are spoilers like this allowed on the subreddit, especially in the goddamn title, I don't want to know about anything about a new season of a show especially after a character dies and they pull the old ""oh he didn't actually die"" thing"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Flashback only hopefully. Kilgraves' overuse during season one led (seemingly because it was David Tennant and somebody decided he needed to be everywhere) to most of the plot hang ups, stupid near misses and characterisation issues. Tennant was superb in the role, but he needed to be a less time, more impact villain. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,So you're using a spoiler as a title?
Marvels Jessica Jones,Resurrection time.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Hmm I wonder how they're going to justify his coming back. A lot of people are saying flashbacks, but we shall see."
Marvels Jessica Jones,This is a welcome surprise. 
Marvels Jessica Jones,My guess is as a wisecracking head on a stick.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I was really hoping in that final scene she was just going to rip his lower jaw off so he couldn't talk any more.  That way the character could come back if he had to, and in a much different way."
Marvels Jessica Jones,Could maybe be a skrull to tie into the next movies? 
Marvels Jessica Jones,What if he's paralyzed from the neck down? Like he's pretty much just a head now...I think he would be even scarier.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"YESSS,someone remind me how he ended in s1?"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"In all fairness he was the best thing in season one, cant blame them wanting to bring him back. I will probably watch season 2 now because of this news"
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Maybe a resurrection by the Hand? Or more likely, flashbacks. 

Hopefully he won't pull a Merlyn à la Arrow. "
Marvels Jessica Jones,Am I the only one kinda hoping its casued by thanos mucking around with the gauntlet and changing reality a bit 
Marvels Jessica Jones,"ITT: ""Could be flashbacks"""
Marvels Jessica Jones,I get that is has a spoiler tag. But what's the point of the spoiler is in the title? I would have rather avoided this spoiler.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"Which I get, but something like a Stark line like ""I'm not running around in a red jumpsuit beating up thugs"" "
Marvels Jessica Jones,David was absolutely amazing in that role. I do hope it's not just flashbacks and Jessicas PTSD though.
Marvels Jessica Jones,Yasssss 
Marvels Jessica Jones,On every tv show there has to be a season full of flash back that is dull as hell.................but not with kil graves.
Marvels Jessica Jones,"I hope they do it well. David tennet was amazing in season 1. Just have a good reason for him to be shown, be it flashbacks or some other reason"
12 Monkeys,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
12 Monkeys,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
12 Monkeys,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
12 Monkeys,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
12 Monkeys,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
12 Monkeys,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
12 Monkeys,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
12 Monkeys,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
12 Monkeys,[deleted]
12 Monkeys,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
12 Monkeys,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
12 Monkeys,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
12 Monkeys,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
12 Monkeys,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
12 Monkeys,Travelers is a good time travel show
12 Monkeys,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
12 Monkeys,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
12 Monkeys,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
12 Monkeys,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
12 Monkeys,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
12 Monkeys,Love this show so much.
12 Monkeys,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
12 Monkeys,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
12 Monkeys,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
12 Monkeys,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
12 Monkeys,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
12 Monkeys,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
12 Monkeys,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
12 Monkeys,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
12 Monkeys,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
12 Monkeys,"great show
always recommend it"
12 Monkeys,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
12 Monkeys,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
12 Monkeys,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
12 Monkeys,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
12 Monkeys,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
12 Monkeys,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
12 Monkeys,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
12 Monkeys,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
12 Monkeys,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
12 Monkeys,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
12 Monkeys,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
12 Monkeys,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
12 Monkeys,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
12 Monkeys,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
12 Monkeys,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
12 Monkeys,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
12 Monkeys,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
12 Monkeys,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
12 Monkeys,Someone must have never seen futurama
12 Monkeys,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
12 Monkeys,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
12 Monkeys,I think Dark has something to say about this
12 Monkeys,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
12 Monkeys,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
12 Monkeys,Good summer binge show
12 Monkeys,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
12 Monkeys,[deleted]
12 Monkeys,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
12 Monkeys,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
12 Monkeys,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
12 Monkeys,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
12 Monkeys,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
12 Monkeys,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
12 Monkeys,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
12 Monkeys,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
12 Monkeys,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
12 Monkeys,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
12 Monkeys,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
12 Monkeys,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
12 Monkeys,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
12 Monkeys,Very nice
12 Monkeys,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
12 Monkeys,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
12 Monkeys,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
12 Monkeys,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
12 Monkeys,Dude spoiler!
12 Monkeys,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
12 Monkeys,Upgrade!
12 Monkeys,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
12 Monkeys,Shame about *The Rig*.
12 Monkeys,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
12 Monkeys,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
12 Monkeys,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
12 Monkeys,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
12 Monkeys,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
12 Monkeys,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I’m 4 episodes in now and I’m loving it.
12 Monkeys,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
12 Monkeys,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
12 Monkeys,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
12 Monkeys,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
12 Monkeys,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.
12 Monkeys,[deleted]
12 Monkeys,"ok, this convinced me to watch it. The movie was ok, not bad but not great as well. Probably the reason why I didn't want to watch the show. I will give it a shot."
12 Monkeys,Is there a place to watch it streaming right now?
12 Monkeys,I think I’ll watch it based on this comment thank you. Same level as dark and mr robot? Sign me up!
12 Monkeys,"Do I need to have seen the movie to enjoy the tv show?

Edit: having discovered the magicians a year or so ago I have changed my tune on syfy shows and am willing to give them a couple episodes of viewing and judge them on their merits. I was definitely one of those “2s” not too long ago"
12 Monkeys,So I read this comment a few days ago and decided to give it a shot because I love breaking bad and better call saul. The plot seems very cool and I love some good time travels stories but the writing is lazy. How many times are they going to have a bad guy at gun point only to hesitate shooting so an explosion can go off and they can escape. It's happened so much that I had to find this comment and say thank you for the recommendation because I am enjoying the show but I can't even begin to put it on the same level as BCS or breaking bad.
12 Monkeys,Legion comes to mind.
12 Monkeys,Interesting to me that you felt they added filler in those seasons. Season 3 and 4 were mapped out from start to finish after season 2 so everything was planned out. I guess I can understand some instances but at that point the show was just having so much fun I didn't care in the slightest.
Scorpion,Isnt this the show that hackers laughed their ass off as not even being remotely realistic?
Scorpion,"I remember watching it when it was on.

I was very surprised it made it to a second series as it was completely ridiculous. And I have a high tolerance for low quality TV."
Scorpion,"I loved it. It was absolutely ludacris and made no logical sense, but the characters were great and it was fun to watch.

I HATED how they ended it, though."
Scorpion,"My wife really liked the show.  Personally I liked mostly all the characters aside from the annoying child and Walter.


However It’s extremely unbelievable with basically every single episode.  


OP says they know nothing about computers but the vast majority of the show is simply illogical if you think about the circumstances for more than a second.  It’s just so far fetched and absolutely stupid that even shutting your brain off to watch it is impossible after awhile.


There were plots that were worse than those F&F or MI movies and that’s saying something!


Not to mention they perpetuate the stereotype that ‘smart’ people can basically not function in a social setting-basically like the Big Bang Theory show but almost even parodying the already absurd caricatures portrayed in that-yet played absolutely straight.


It’s foolishness 🙄"
Scorpion,I watched it with my kids. It was funny and quirky. One of the few shows I didn't mind watching each week.
Scorpion,We watched it when it was on tv. It's on our re-watch list but haven't started it yet. Your right it is very good.
Scorpion,"I watched some of it too.  Some good characters but most weren’t that entertaining.  Walter wasn’t a fun lead and that was my main problem with show.  If show isnt going care about realism and isn’t that serious, it should be fun and it wasn’t that fun.  Finch was pretty entertaining admittedly"
Scorpion,I quit after they decided to go with trope of the social girl & the nerd guy.
Scorpion,"Scorpion was a terrible show for many reasons, none of which includes the fact that the ""hacking"" wasn't realistic."
Scorpion,"If it were only the hacking. Everything depicted is so absolutely ludicrous it's borderline insulting. The first episode has a bug in software at LAX which somehow spread to all airliners and makes it impossible for them to land. Therefor they connect to one plane (not infected) using a lan cable while it flies low over the airport runway, matching it's speed from Walt's cool Ferarri. Nothing makes sense in this show once you thing about it for one second. It's basically what if /r/iamverysmart was a tv show. How it ever got greenlit after the pilot episode and found a following is beyond me. /rant"
Scorpion,"It also *declined in quality* (believe or not!!) pretty quickly after season #1. IIRC, by season #3 it was straight-up garbage! (I'm guessing that factored in CBS's decision to cancel it.) 

So even if you like season #1 in a ""turn your brain off"" sort of way, it gets harder and harder to do that in later two seasons."
Scorpion,Oh no it has a bad ending?!? Oh dear not excited about that
Scorpion,"Interesting, I’m quite the opposite I’ve found all the characters to be entertaining, although I understand the Walter thing but watching him grow throughout the seasons is so rewarding and worth it. I don’t know who Finch is though."
Scorpion,"Interesting, it’s what a I love about it! Paige and Walter are my main ship and I can’t wait to see where their relationship goes!"
Scorpion,"Interesting points you make. For me, I love it for the characters, the drama, and the heart. It also helps that I’m bad at all things science, math, and tech so I buy all their technobabble and my my belief is more easily suspended. This far all their situations and solutions have made sense to me."
Scorpion,"They ended a season on a cliffhanger and then canceled it. So it was never resolved, and it was a depressing one."
Scorpion,"Yeah, I can see that if one is very invested in the characters then it might work, I just couldn't look over the story."
Scorpion,Oh no! I hate when they do that! Now I’m not sure I want to finish the show. I can’t stand depressing endings especially when I’ve become emotionally connected with the characters. Thanks for the heads up though!
Scorpion,"Understandable. What was wrong with the story for you? I found it interesting, engaging, and entertaining."
Scorpion,Sorry for dampening your excitement!
Scorpion,By story I meant the extreme plotholes and the bad writing regarding the problems/cases. As far as I remember the few episodes I saw the character interactions (with the child for example) were fine.
Scorpion,It’s okay now I can mentally prepare myself for it!
Scorpion,"Interesting. I haven’t noticed any plot holes this far, and I don’t really mind them if they don’t pop out at me, and the writing around the problems/cases seems fine to me because I don’t get science and math so I just go with it."
Scorpion,"[I won’t spoil the ending here]

I agree with the other poster who said it was a sadder cliffhanger. HOWEVER, I will also say that if season 5 would have happened, the cliffhanger ending had a neat twist that would have changed the show in a good way. 

Also, it was clear that the “sad” part of the ending was also going to be resolved too, as the cliffhanger also set up the inevitable resolution of the cliffhanger. 

So I say finish it. Yes, it’s ridiculous science but it’s also kinda fun. And the ending is a cliffhanger, but not in a “they’re all being slowly lowered into a vat of lava then the show ends” sorta way. Like I said, you’ll easily be able to “head cannon” how it works out."
Scorpion,Thank you for telling me that helps a lot.
Scorpion,I just watched the ending and what the freak?!? I hate it so much!!! I fail to see how splitting team Scorpion up is good it’s exactly what Colin’s wanted! I can’t figure how they’d resolve this cliffhanger. It feels like Walter really messed things up this time and it won’t be an easy fix. I’m glad at least Cane stayed with him but I don’t like that Florence is working for him now. Maybe once I cool down a bit I’ll be able to head canon how it all works out but right now I’m to riled up. I’m so mad! I feared this exact thing happening the entire show!
Scorpion,"Yeah, it ended on a cliffhanger and that sucks, but a resolution seems obvious and the changes the S4 finale made would have taken the show into a cool new direction. 

Season 5 would have had 2 parallel Scorpion-like teams. Team Paige vs Team Walter. They’d go head to head, Sometimes team Walter would win, sometimes Team Paige. There’s competition, but they still interact across jobs and respect one another despite the tension. Each side has to bring in new team members. This allows us to meet fun, interesting, perhaps evil new character. Some are great new team members, some are disasters that last an episode or two and drive the plot a bit. 

Eventually (perhaps in the S5 finale) the teams have to come together because neither team has the proper talent to complete a major, city-saving challenge. By working together, they save the day and then SCORPION 2.0 begins in season 6. Walter and Paige also reconcile during the city-saving event on some climactic, heroic way. The core team is back along with the best/most liked new members of the team. 

Then, at the end of the s5 finale, drop some fun cliffhanger on the new, reunited Scorpion 2.0 team which drives season 6…"
Scorpion,"That does sound interesting but I’m a bit torn on that. On one hand I hate seeing them divided and I’d hate it for a whole season while on the other hand I can see how that would make for an interesting season. It does remind me a bit of my least favorite season of Gilmore Girls though where the main characters where fighting for a whole season. I especially dislike that they built Walter and Paige up for 3 seasons only to have them together for one then break up again it’s exhausting I just want them to be happy. Another show I love , Leverage, did the same thing where they split up at the end of the season and it didn’t work well for them either. Also, apparently if their was a season 5 it was gonna be revealed that Flo was a plant by Colin’s."
Scorpion,Darren from bewitched
Scorpion,Mat from Wheel of time is recast for season 2.
Scorpion,"Spartacus. After season one, Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with cancer and so they made the prequel series Gods of the Arena, while he was undergoing treatment. But unfortunately, the cancer returned and Andy Whitfield passed away and was replaced with Liam McIntyre. 

Unlike The Witcher, which is carried entirely by Henry Cavill, Spartacus had a great cast of supporting characters, especially Manu Bennett, who was kind of the heart and soul of the show. Liam McIntyre did a good job filling the role of Spartacus and the great supporting cast was able to help carry the show to a fantastic conclusion."
Scorpion,Altered Carbon had the main character recast but it was intentional and made sense in the story (characters could upload their conscience to a drive or something and then switch bodies). It unfortunately did not work.
Scorpion,Doctor Who...
Scorpion,Superboy. Went from John Haymes Newton in season 1 to Gerard Christopher for the three remaining seasons.
Scorpion,"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, where one of the main male characters / love interests who was originally played by Santino Fontana was recast to Skyler Astin. Santino played the character Greg in season 1 and left the show in season 2 I think once his contract ended (probably to do Tootsie on Broadway). As a big fan of his character I was extremely bummed about the departure but I respected his decision although some of the other fans did get a bit annoying to the point that I think the show runners kind of were like “enough with the Santino questions, we are done with the Greg story arc”. Anyway I was a fan of the show notwithstanding the lack of Santino so I continued watching seasons 2, 3 and 4…… only for the character Greg to reappear, now played by Skylar. The show did get quite meta about it with jokes about how he literally looked different. I also like Skylar and I think he’s an incredible performer but I did feel a bit insulted as an original Santino-Greg fan. 

Also Santino went on to win a Tony for his role in Tootsie so I’m happy for him, but I’m still slightly sore about the recast"
Scorpion,"Aunt viv from fresh price of bel air famously got recast after a couple seasons

Edited to add. In the animation world Meg Griffen In family guy was recasted after one season then mila kunis took over"
Scorpion,"Naya Rivera in season 3 of Step Up: High Water...although, that is an extenuating circumstance. But I thought they should have had Christina Millian play a completely different character, rather than take over as Naya's."
Scorpion,"Lecy Goranson to Sarah Chalke as Becky in Roseanne.



Andy Samberg to Taylor Lautner as Dale Ashbrick in Cuckoo."
Scorpion,"Batwoman. Ruby Rose left (or fired) after season one and not only her character got recasted, it also got demoted from being the main character as they introduced new main character."

Scorpion,"Also, the “lethal weapon” tv series, changed out “Riggs” character like one season in"
Scorpion,"In the MCU, there's Edward Norton being replaced by Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner/Hulk. And to a lesser extent (i.e., not main character), Terrance Howard being replaced by Don Cheadle to play James Rhodes/War Machine."
Scorpion,"Spartacus TV show, although that wasn't by choice."
Scorpion,Andy Whitfield in Spartacus. 😭
Scorpion,https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin
Scorpion,"In Star Trek: Deep Space 9, main cast character Jadzia Dax, played by Terry Farrell, was kind of recast in the last season of the show. More comparable to a Doctor Who regeneration than anything, though."
Scorpion,"Full House filmed the pilot episode with a different Danny Tanner - actor John posey. Bob saget was committed to a CBS show…the CBS show ended up getting cancelled & FH fired John and recast Danny with bob. There are clips of John posey as Danny Tanner on YouTube - weird to see someone else as that character! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M-7WwU0DE7M

Ross’ wife in FRIENDS was recast after the pilot (aired). The actress thought she was going to have a bigger role and bolted."
Scorpion,"Sliders. (Pretty sure anyway, it has been a while)

That last season was awful......"
Scorpion,"Scott Glenn was originally going to be Clay Morrow in Sons of Anarchy. (I don't know if this counts.) He was replaced by Ron Perlman. (Story goes that they filmed the whole pilot with Glenn, but after deciding on going in a different direction. They decide with Perlman.)"
Scorpion,"Richard Harris played Dumbledore in the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies.  Then he died, so the role was taken over by Michael Gambon."
Scorpion,"Not sure if this counts, when they made the Stargate show they replaced the main cast from the movie. Most notably Kurt Russell with Richard Dean Andersen and James Spader with Michael Shanks"
Scorpion,Jack Ryan was played by Alec Baldwin and then Harrison Ford.
Scorpion,"Game of Thrones had a lot of recasts.

The Mountain was recast like three times.

Other recasts from memory: Beric Dondarrion, Daario, Tommen/Mycrella, Dickon Tarly, the Three eyed Raven, the Night King, the child of the forrest that Bran talks to, Rickard Karstark, Lothar Frey, Selyse Baratheon …"
Scorpion,Halloweentown. The main character Marnie was recast in the 4th movie for an actress who brings a very different personality to the character.
Scorpion,"When it’s such a major character, as with this situation, I find it surprising that they choose to continue the series. Honestly, as it is continuing, it would make more sense to me if they introduced Liam Hemsworth near the end of the third season as a completely new character,  rather than have him replace him as the same one.

I know batwoman went the route of introducing a new character, while also having a different actress portray the original character in limited capacity later down the line.

Superman and Lois had to recast one of the sons after the actor chose to leave the show. Although, with how they have multiple Earths on that series, I personally would have had it so that  some event occurred that caused him and an alternate version of him to trade places rather than be a direct recast. 

I find that the worlds feel less believable to me when shows recast a character and act as though it’s nothing out of the ordinary. It feels almost like those soap operas that kill off a character or have them leave, just to come back later on as a completely different actor over and over again lol"
Scorpion,"Dalgliesh  
The final couple of seasons Martin Shaw replaced Roy Marsden in the title role"
Scorpion,Dick Sargent replaced Dick York as Darrin Stephens on Bewitched.
Scorpion,"Miss Marple, has had several actors play her, all of whom were pretty great but my personal favourite was Geraldine McEwan. But this worked fine since the episodes are basically stand alone and have an ensemble cast.

Midsomer Murders, John Nettles was replaced by Neil Dudgeon, who kept the name of DCI ""Barnaby"" with the explanation of being his cousin (if I remember correctly). He had a role in an earlier episode as one of the suspects which I always find kind of funny. Again, show tends to have a strong ensemble cast.

McCallum, John Hannah got replaced by Nathaniel Parker as the lead (""same same but different"" in terms of character) but the series didn't continue, which was probably for the best.

Oh, and Bat Woman, Lmao!"
Scorpion,Well besides James Bond:  Batman. I'll try to think of another example.
Scorpion,Waaat Henry left? good for him tbh the show went to shit.
Scorpion,Lethal Weapon 5. You know what I’m talking about.
Scorpion,"I guess if we’re including movies, Mel Gibson to Tom Hardy in *Mad Max: Fury Road*.

There was also a *Robocop* sequel without Peter Weller.

If you want a video game example, *Splinter Cell: Blacklist* replaced long-time lead VO Michael Ironside with Eric Johnson. It was highly criticized because Ironside was iconic in the role, and Johnson sounded way too young (well, he was also really bland and stiff in the role) for an older Sam Fisher."
Scorpion,Excluding obvious things like a movie that became a TV series like Buffy. Cagney & Lacey replaced one of the leads after the first season. Other than that I can only come up with supporting characters like Becky on Roseanne
Scorpion,Not exactly a recast but Will Smith's mother in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air in the opening credits is not the same person who plays his actual mother in the show. Also Aunt Viv was recast.
Scorpion,I know it's not all TV but Moira Kelly took over as Donna in Fire Walk With Me while Lara Flynn Boyle played her in the first 2 seasons of Twin Peaks.
Scorpion,MCU Hulk
Scorpion,"Two shows come to mind. Spartacus and Batwoman. In the case of Spartacus the main actor died of cancer. In the case of Batwoman, Ruby Rose left the show.

Edit"
Scorpion,"Capheus on Sense8 was recast.  Originally played by Aml Ameen, the new actor in Season 2 was Toby Onwumere."
Scorpion,"Many different actors have played Tarzan and Sherlock Holmes in TV and film, but these tend to be different series."
Scorpion,"Terence Howard replaced by Don Cheadle as Col ""War Machine"" Rhodes. 

Because Ike Perlmutter was a racist asshole."

Scorpion,Hannibal.
Scorpion,Doctor Who but the character and show are designed for it to make sense.
Scorpion,Buffy. It was originally a movie with Kristy Swanson as Buffy. Then the show came out with Sarah Michelle Gellar.

Scorpion,Dr Who
Scorpion,"This recast is actually curious... Eliot Page.

He changed sex during the show so the character had to go through sex change too.

It was beautifully done in the series, BTW."
Scorpion,Not the main character but a main character.. aunt viv in fresh prince
Scorpion,The original Star Trek. William Shatner only appeared in the second episode as captain Kirk and it wasn't clear what happened to Pike after a while.

Scorpion,Batman. Spider-Man. Hulk. Probably other costumed superhero movies that I’m not aware of.
Scorpion,George mcfly
Scorpion,Not a major character but in the last season of Better Call Saul they recast Jeffy the taxi driver and completely changed the character's personality.

W/ Bob and David,"I'm counting the days. Watched through the Mr Show episodes multiple times preparing. I'm a huge fan of David Cross anyways but Mr.Show was perfect. That and Chappelle were the only sketch comedy I need. Key and Peele if I can add a third, Ben Stiller Show if a fourth, and Kids in the Hall if a fifth. I'm excited. "
W/ Bob and David,Less than two more weeks! I'm so excited!
W/ Bob and David,Looking forward to this show 
W/ Bob and David,"For me personally, there was an subtle craft that went into the original Mr Show. The Pythonesque linking of clips throughout the entire episode, the intentional ""low budget"" set design (compared to SNL) and the unique subversiveness set it apart from other shows. I worry that in this landscape they don't have any edge to separate them from the competition, or more likely to improve on the copycats they influenced which is the best kind of compliment but the worst kind of situation to be in. I'm other words, they set a high bar for themselves that others have only raised even higher.

That being said, I laughed a lot more at the concept and writing premise of this skit than I did at any ""jokes."" Which is good on my eyes because with sketch comedy (improv or scripted), you need to understand the purpose of a bit before you can make it funny and this shows they a good framework to work from in my opinion. The acting can make or break it, but it can never make up for poor writing."
W/ Bob and David,"...oh man.  Huge Mr. Show fan and I didn't even crack a smile.  I'm a little worried, but still cautiously optimistic."
W/ Bob and David,TRIGGER WARNING for anyone who went to college in the last 5 years

W/ Bob and David,Stiller show before Kids in the Hall? Blasphemy! 
W/ Bob and David,[deleted]
W/ Bob and David,I assume in the full episodes there will still be the linking of the clips throughout.  You just don't see it in these short videos Netflix is throwing up on youtube.
W/ Bob and David,Yeah dude I'm really glad TV execs are looking out for us :)
W/ Bob and David,"To be honest I usually have to be really baked to fully enjoy Flying Circus as a whole. Though I do love Monty Python, and SCTV, and SNL, In Living Colour etc. "
W/ Bob and David,"It was Eddie Munster, and Manson that edged it slightly ahead. Plus Bob Odenkirk and my still standing crush on Janeane Garofalo lol. "
W/ Bob and David,Nope but I'm Canadian so I dont remember it airing here. I'm gonna see if I can check it out. 
W/ Bob and David,"Still... Kids in the Hall is a much steadier show, with way more episodes and not a single one of them has any Andy Dick in them. "
W/ Bob and David,American Vandal and F is for Family

W/ Bob and David,Travelers is a pretty solid show - though I have to admit the first couple episodes did throw me off a little.

W/ Bob and David,Haunting of Hill House is really great.

W/ Bob and David,F is for Family is hilarious
W/ Bob and David,"From your list, Maniac and Glow"
W/ Bob and David,Sick Note. Starts out pretty slow but takes a wild turn very soon. Worth a watch
W/ Bob and David,"American Vandal is an underrated comedy. If you've seen any crime documentary, then you'll enjoy it. Or if you like to laugh, you'll enjoy it. It's not about murder or anything you'd feel bad about. The first season has a mystery that's surrounded by dicks. Second season is about poop. Don't take that as it's a bunch of poop and dick jokes. Just watch it."
W/ Bob and David,Manhunt Unabomber and Haunting of hill house
W/ Bob and David,"I can’t believe no one has said it yet but Love is one of my favorite shows of all time. I think it captures what it’s like to be a twenty/thirty something right now so perfectly, and even though none of the characters are particularly great people I related to and loved all of them. Plus it’s hilarious! "
W/ Bob and David,"I don't think anyone has said it yet, but Godless. 7 episode Western miniseries from a couple years ago that won some Emmys. "
W/ Bob and David,Nailed It
W/ Bob and David,"Daredevil , Longmire,F is for Family"

For talk shows I really like The Patriot Act and the new comedy panel show The Fix."
W/ Bob and David,"Marco Polo

Great second season, but unfortunately its last."
W/ Bob and David,You should watch Somebody Feed Phil! It’s a documentary series about food from different countries and it’s actually hilarious because of Phil. 
W/ Bob and David,Neo Yokio is everything you could ever want from anime inspired programming featuring the voice talent of Jaden Smith and Jude Law.
W/ Bob and David,"**dear white people** - i loved S2 even more than the first.  smart, interesting, well-acted, great characters, and a very unique aesthetic, plus one of the best ""bottle"" episodes i've seen in a while - it's definitely in my top ten shows of the year."
W/ Bob and David,"Lilyhammer. It's a dark comedy about a New York mobster who goes into Witness Protection, and decides to go to Lilyhammer, Norway. It stars Steven Van Zandt, the bassist from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band. "
W/ Bob and David,Hemlock Grove
W/ Bob and David,"I assume you might know it but they released a new series for Narcos. Narcos Mexico, it's a spin-off but totally separated than the normal show. Still if you liked one, you'll surely like the other. 

You also missed La Casa de Papel (or Money Heist in US I think). It's a Spanish show about a heist that is really good.

If you're not opposed to animation, they have Bojack Horseman which is critically acclaimed, Disenchanted (by the creator of Simpsons and Futurama but fantasy themed), Trollhunters (and soon 3Below in the same universe) from Del Toro, Voltron (by the creators of Legend of Korra) and The Dragon Prince (from one of the writers of ATLA)."
W/ Bob and David,On My Block
W/ Bob and David,"I really enjoyed 3%. It is a Brazilian show dubbed in English, which normally isn't my style- but I ended up really enjoying it which was a surprise!"

W/ Bob and David,F is for family shits on your whole list tbh
W/ Bob and David,"If you liked making a murderer and wild wild country, watch Evil Genius and The staircase. 

Staircase is actually an older show, and the only ""Netflix original"" content in it is 3 episodes of a follow-up. But it's a great true crime doc."
W/ Bob and David,"Dark Tourist

Travels with my Father

OP, you're gonna love them. I guarantee it. Especially liking Ugly Delicious."
W/ Bob and David,"My favorite shows that you are missing are **Love**, **The End Of The Fucking World**, and **Maniac**.

**Love** is the Judd Apatow style romantic comedy about two dysfunctional (narcissistic, neurotic, alcoholic) people who meet and help improve each other.

**The End Of The Fucking World** is a British-style, dark comedy about two dysfunctional teens (depressed, insecure, borderline sociopathic) who meet and help improve each other.

**Maniac** is the Cary Fukanaga directed (from True Detective season 1) absurdist alternate reality comedy where two dysfunctional people (grief-stricken, lonely, schizophrenic) meet inside each other's minds and help improve each other.

Wow it looks like I have a type of show I like huh."
W/ Bob and David,I just finished the first season of Bad Blood. It was good. 
W/ Bob and David,I agree with a lot of the suggestions but have to add The OA. This show was a mind trip and doesn't get mentioned enough.
W/ Bob and David,The Crown. It's probably their best show.
W/ Bob and David,"Jessica Jones is worth the watch (or at least season one is), as is Lovesick (so much heart in one tiny show)."
W/ Bob and David,"Travelers, the OA, American Vandal"
W/ Bob and David,"Maniac needs to be seen.  It's basically a Black Mirror mini series.  
  
The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.  I didn't expect much from this show, but I came out really loving it.  They lean super hard on the witches and santantism.  Much harder than you'd expect.  For example, they celebrate thanksgiving by picking a random witch and eating her alive on the floor of their church. 
  
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.  Six tales of the west told by the Coen Brothers.  Its weird, funny and deeply entertaining.  
  
Happy! Not a Netflix Original, but its a seriously fucked up show that's goddamn awesome.  It's about an ex-cop hitman who teams up with a little girls imaginary friend in order find and stop her kidnapper. "
W/ Bob and David,Voltron and hilda are both amazing
W/ Bob and David,"Maniac.

Lost In Space. (whatever you think it is, it's not.)

W/ Bob and David,Atypical & Bodyguard. 
W/ Bob and David,"Elite, Sabrina, Glow, American Vandal"
W/ Bob and David,"Maniac, The Dragon Prince, and Disenchantment"
W/ Bob and David,Daredevil
W/ Bob and David,"I'd recommend F is for Family as your next viewing. It starts a little slow for some people, but it is so good when it's rolling. 

Disenchantment is also pretty good. It's not a worldbeater or anything, but it's a fun 4-5 hours. 

I've also heard good things about Voltron and The Dragon Prince (from the creators of Legend of Korra and The Last Airbender, respectively) as well, but I haven't had the chance to see them yet. 

Oh, and The Kominsky Method. It's from Chuck Lorre, but the show's nothing like TBBT or 2&1/2 Men. It's full of dark-humor and it's downright good. 

And there're also a lot of British shows that are ""Netflix Originals"" even though they aren't like Cuckoo, Sick Note, and more. 

My Next Guest with David Letterman is a pretty good interview show, if you care for that. "

Enjoy\~"
W/ Bob and David,"GLOW - Don’t be put off by the wrestling side of things if you’re not a fan. The show explores so much more than that.

F Is For Family - Created by Bill Burr, about a family living in the 70’s. I can’t put into words how funny it is.

The Adventures Of Puss In Boots - This is really only if you’re into the Shreck/Puss In Boots movies, but I found it really good. The first season is pretty slow but after that it does pick up into a decent story."

W/ Bob and David,"I've been watching Bad Blood, which stars Anthony LaPaglia and the guy who played Tig on SOA.  It's not bad, only six episodes.  Based on a true story about a mobster from Montreal."
W/ Bob and David,Lilyhammer
W/ Bob and David,"American Vandal season 2 was probably my quickest binge this year, I was unsure of it to start, but damn great finish. "
W/ Bob and David,"F is for Family is so fucking good

And anyine whi disagrees ""ILL PUT YOU THROUGH THAT FUCKIN WALL!"""
The Team,Apparently the budget of the whole season is around $11 millions US. Which is around the cost of ***one (1)*** episode of the upcoming Netflix show.
The Team,30 episodes? jesus
The Team,"It is also worth noting this is available on Rakuten Viki in a lot of markets as well as YouTube. 

I’ve not had the chance to check it out yet but I absolutely will. Glad to hear it is a very solid adaptation and that they have plans to do the sequel books as well."
The Team,We are all turkeys. So are you.
The Team,"I knew nothing of this going in, and haven't watched anything Chinese before. Episode 2 was mind-blowing in the best of ways."
The Team,"Thanks for this, I was unaware I could watch it yet.  I saw your link as well.  I am pumped to watch this.

I have read through the boxset enough times that I actually just reordered it.  My friends think I am nuts for multiple reads for some reason."
The Team,"so much better than the CGI version, ""The Three Body Problem"" so confusing with three different TV shows and apparently a movie out there somewhere. I watched one episode of that and didn't continue, only started the first episode of this live action one, but wow that other one is bad."
The Team,"Honestly surprised at how much of the VR stuff they're doing and the production value of the CGI.  It's not amazing by any means, but it looks surprisingly good at times.  I believe in the Netflix version they'll be doing all those scenes with actors on a green screen.

I'm enjoying it quite a bit. It's so slow with the 30 episode run, and the cinematography and areas they film are so beautiful at times. It's nice to just turn on and chill and watch.  

Loved the books after reading them just over the past few months and I have serious concerns with the Netflix version as this does not seem like a book series you can really turn into a short, bingeable streaming show.  But they are going hard into the books on this version, for better or worse, and I don't imagine anyone else would do such a faithful translation to the screen."
The Team,"\>they recently announced they will also do the other books in the series. 

Hurray! I just finished the show, was hugely impressed. Hadn't seen any Chinese TV shows before.

30 episodes meant they got to take their time and include (almost?) everything from the book. Has been a few years since I read it."
The Team,"How did you watch it, it doesn’t appear to be out yet"
The Team,"Going to have to check this out!  I just finished the last book in the trilogy a few days ago, and found them to be quite enjoyable.  Had no idea they were being adapted into a series, though (until now).  Thanks!"
The Team,"Definitely looking forward to binging it

I never read the books so it will be interesting to see the story for the first time"
The Team,I'll have to give it a try
The Team,"It's great isn't it I'm! 18 eps in, loving how fleshed out and not rushed it seems. The story telling has been fantastic throughout but especially ep 14(I think) onwards."
The Team,"Not a fan of the book, it's extremely pessimistic. The ""solution"" to the problem in the first book is kind of comical. It's made out to be some incredibly difficult problem that an interstellar civilization couldn't figure out, but then, it's just answered pretty plainly.

Also the author is a horrible person."
The Team,"I got as far as ep 4 then gave up, it was progressing so slowly - an entire episode given over to our guy wondering  about the numbers appearing in his photos - I was dying of boredom. Maybe I'll give it another go and carry on at some point, IDK. 
Loved the books."
The Team,"It's shot like a parody. You have to be paid to hype that trash so much, especially to suggest it will influence a generation."
The Team,"Wow that's a pretty incredible difference, can't wait to see what take Netflix and co. will have on this"
The Team,"the real difference is that everything is expensive in Hollywood because of unions, production crews, filming location, taxes and etc...

so with 11 million dollars they are able to do something Hollywood would need like 50 million"
The Team,Yeah I'll admit that's a big draw to me; I love when writers have lots of runtime to work with. It (in the right hands) does the subject matter better justice and they seem to really have splurged on this.
The Team,"There are some extremely long series (30-50 episodes) in both China and Korea for one season, sometimes with 70-90 minute episode run time in Korean TV where they can't show commercials so the episodes incorporate a lot of product placement versus 44 minutes in American broadcast TV with about 15 minutes for commercial breaks.
The upside is one knows in advance that the series will usually end with one season."
The Team,The movie was terrible/not representative of the book  as could be expected for such a short runtime. The effects were ok but I’m not really there for that
The Team,"While Netflix might not be the best bet for the most faithful adaptation they're probably more likely to actually finish the story. Although they've said it's renewed waiting for 2nd seasons of Chinese shows is a nightmare, it could be 1 year, 5 years or even never. It's supposedly really popular over there so hopefully it falls more on the quicker end of the scale but they don't have a good track record."
The Team,"Agreed on all points. The CGI (>!mostly the virtual world scenes!<) is probably the worst part of the show for me. It is kindof surprisingly bad? Not bad, just not up to par with the rest of the show and certainly not excellent"
The Team,"A yes! Forgot the essential bit.

Here is the link to the playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMX26aiIvX5rFSYPXtcqda3tWd6pGVD5Q](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMX26aiIvX5rFSYPXtcqda3tWd6pGVD5Q)

&#x200B;

Added tip: I found setting the subtitles to 150% works best"
The Team,Why is he a horrible person?
The Team,"I’m curious, have you watched full episodes to form this opinion?"
The Team,"i probably should've expanded but i'm surprised. it's hopefully a good thing because from what i've heard about the three body problem is that it would be hard to adapt to film but i don't know if that's a runtime issue or a ""this show gets weird and would be hard to translate"" but either way it's good the writers were given enough room to move. so long as it isn't bloat"
The Team,"It's weird because some stuff, like when there is a lot of smoke, it looks like a PS2 game.  But other times, when the CGI characters are talking, you can ""see"" the actors face in their CGI character. It's so weird.  I don't imagine they did mocap on the faces like Avatar lol

EDIT: It's also so weird to see >!the Trisolarians dehydrate. I always thought they'd just dry out into like a strawman. And later on didn't even picture them as human beings.  But in the show they lay down and just start flipping out with water squirting everywhere!<"
The Team,A point here is that the show is set in 2007. So it is representing things from 16 years ago. It's kinda funny that parts of it are practically a VW commercial. All the main characters drive those older VWs. Or maybe I just notice more because the main character drives the same Gen1 Tiguan I drove up until about three weeks ago.
The Team,"How do you change the subtitle settings?

And thanks for this"
The Team,">He expressed support for policies such as the one-child policy and the Xinjiang internment camps

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin"
The Team,I dare anyone here to start watching that and try to get through full episodes.
The Team,"That's the average length for Chinese tv shows. It's because one season runs are common instead of telling a story over multiple seasons.

There's are benefits and drawbacks to this. One drawback being there's often more filler."
The Team,"> i don't know if that's a runtime issue or a ""this show gets weird and would be hard to translate""

It's the latter. There's an entire sequence at the end involving a proton that is one of the coolest sci-fi things I've ever read but seems impossible to film. It'll be a lot of exposition over some hopefully cool cgi but like, I wouldnt want to be the graphic artists in charge of that."
The Team,"Yeah so far so good, no bloat but for sure they are not rushed. The conversion of this book into a shorter film form is the big reason many including myself are quite worried about the upcoming Netflix version, though I do hope it can also be fun to watch, I can't imagine it reaching the depths of the Tencent version."
The Team,"Honestly, the first book is a straight up mystery story that doesn't get really crazy and takes place in current times. That one seems like the easiest to film as it's almost just a buddy cop story with a scientist and hot headed detective

The 2nd and 3rd book though are just full of huge scifi set pieces and theoretical concepts that I had a hard time fully visualizing.  They're just chock full of stuff that would need to be CGI to show."
The Team,Actually that's a better way to describe it! The CGI quality is really uneven. >!Like all space scenes are good to me. The people are decent but yes the dehydration scenes are probably the worst. And the physics of when the bodies 'pour' out of the pyramids...what?!!<

The Team,"I have watched the entire series, I don't know what you are talking about. I don't speak a word of chinese, (and english isn't my first language so I'm used to watch english shows with subtitles) and I had never read the books but I was captivated right from the start.

It has an, what's the english word? intimist aspect? I really love how the characters Da Shi and Wang Miao interact and how they slowly progress to become friends. How it is Da Shi, the ordinary policeman, who in the end helps so much humanity.

Ye Wenjie is portrayed amazingly by both actresses. I only regret not seeing fully what happened to her during some parts of her life (not going to spoil it but I suppose those who have seen the drama or read the book understand what I mean) but all in all, it was a great drama.

It's not all about the money. The Netflix series will be more polished, probably, because of the money invested and I will watch this adaptation. But money is not all."
The Team,"There are a ton of things in the book that I honestly can’t imagine them translating - the crazy 2d things, the proton stuff at the end, all kinds of stuff. I’m not one for subtitles, and am very curious about the Netflix version, but this may have sold me on giving this a go."
The Team,"I can't wait for that. That's when the book went from ""wtf?' to ""holy crap that is insane"".   There are so many moments like that where something will happen and I think ""well you can't explain that scientifically"" and then it does haha"
The Team,"Lol this just came across.my YouTube feed and actually shows how they filmed it. They did use face tracking cameras!  And motion capture suits.  This scene specifically shows them filming >!the dehydrating scene and explaining how to do it to the actors!<

https://youtu.be/LvxZ10Ra0Hk"
The Team,My hero
The Team,Money can't buy care and professionalism.
The Team,I'm the same way but I think I'm gonna give this version a try
The Team,Thanks for the details!
The Team,Coolio was fuckin Kwanzabot?! I'm such an idiot
The Team,"Coolio did a lot of content for previous Futurama episodes, both as Kwanzabot and It was implied that he was President of Earth at some point, as his profile appeared on the [2996 quarter coin](https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/futurama/7/74/CoolioQuarter.jpg)."
The Team,How did he die?
The Team,"For reference, here's the song he did for [Bender's Big Score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b21kNh-Guyo), with John DiMaggio as Robot Santa and Mark Hamill as Hannukah Zombie."
The Team,This is a sad way to learn Futurama is coming back.
The Team,"*sniffles* ""Goodbye, from the world of tomorrow."""
The Team,"He was just on Jimmy Kimmel like, two weeks ago. Crazy."
The Team,"Wait… future season…. What ?!
Rip Coolio…"
The Team,"Wait, they’re making more Futurama?"
The Team,Thank god this is coming back. This show beats the shit out of family guy and the Simpsons
The Team,Kwanzaabot!
The Team,TIL Kwanzaabot was voiced by Coolio.
The Team,"Oh wow, was watching episode with Kwanza-bot last night."
The Team,Now that is some serious r/unexpectedfuturama!
The Team,I thought Futurama was cancelled ages ago
The Team,I’ve been handing these out for 647 years
The Team,Futurama has new season coming?
The Team,Wait... futurama's getting a new season?
The Team,Futurama is still making episodes?!?
The Team,"> as a send-off.

Wait, he died!?"
The Team,"*record scratch*

New Futurama season you say???"
The Team,I defiantly had to check IMDb to realize they are making another season.
The Team,"Futurama is still a thing!!! Wow i loved this show back in the day, need to get back on that train"
The Team,Kwanza bot isthat dude
The Team,What the hell is Kwanzaa?!?
The Team,"I watched the S7 Xmas episode with him last night right before I read the news and I was saying to my friend that I didn’t really like the episode. Guys, I think this is all my fault"
The Team,The best way to dedicate a living legend. Rip
The Team,I thought that was Danny Glover for a second.
The Team,RIP Kwanza Bot
The Team,Futurama upcoming season? I thought the show got canceled years ago?
The Team,How do people not know he was Kwanzaa-bot?
The Team,Kujichagulia!
The Team,Rip Legend!
The Team,Reagan and Coolio forever 💘
The Team,UPCOMING SEASON?!?!
The Team,"I am fully expecting a tribute in the next episode of Hot Ones as Coolio is their first guest to have passed away, and I think Sean has class and would want to do it. RIP Coolio."
The Team,Kwazang
The Team,"wait what, there's a upcoming season?"
The Team,I had no idea he was almost 60.  If asked i would have said 45ish
The Team,I'm not crying you're crying.
The Team,TIL there is a new season of Futurama coming out!!!!!!
The Team,I... didn't know he was Kwanza bot.
The Team,How is it news to so many here about Futurama returning again after the whole issue with John Dimaggio not wanting to return unless he got paid more?
The Team,TDIL futurama is still airing new episodes...
The Team,The most surprising part of this was that Futurama is still going?
The Team,"Wait, what? Futurama?"
The Team,They're already this far into production? I thought this continuation was still years off.
The Team,"RIP COOLI0!! I CREATED A TRIBUTE PAGE TO HONOR THIS SONG AND MY MEMORIES OF THE IMPACT IT HAD ON MY LIFE. IF YOU LOVED THIS SONG OR COOLIO....PLEASE LEAVE MESSAGE IN THE COMMENT SECTION THE VIDEO! THANKS!! XOXO  
https://youtu.be/IWKik5-iFyM"
The Team,Now there won’t be a Kwanzaa. Like every year before 1967.
The Team,He died taking a dump a lot of people go that way.
The Team,Yayyyyyy
The Team,"He was a real piece of shit with how he treated his 6 kids, his girlfriend 

Glad he s dead"
The Team,Coolio was still alive?! Futurama is still on the air?!
Care Bears and Cousins,Jean Smart HAS to win that comedy actress award. Her performance in Hacks is far and away the best TV I've watched in a while.
Care Bears and Cousins,"TV Winners:

* DRAMA ENSEMBLE - **The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTRESS - **Jennifer Coolidge, The White Lotus**
* DRAMA ACTOR - **Jason Bateman, Ozark**
* COMEDY ENSEMBLE - **Abbott Elementary**
* COMEDY ACTRESS - **Jean Smart, Hacks**
* COMEDY ACTOR - **Jeremy Allen White, The Bear**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — FEMALE ACTOR - **Jessica Chastain, George & Tammy**
* TV-MOVIE OR MINISERIES — MALE ACTOR - **Sam Elliott, 1883**
* STUNT ENSEMBLE - **Stranger Things**"
Care Bears and Cousins,The Bear is a Comedy???
Care Bears and Cousins,I hope Jeremy Allen White wins the Emmy. He is such a good actor and The Bear is so good
Care Bears and Cousins,"How did the cast of Game of Thrones never win Drama Ensemble at the SAG Awards? Forget the writing of S8 (well S7 too), the show had a phenomenal cast."
Care Bears and Cousins,"I’ve seen White Lotus. I’ve seen Better Call Saul. 

Rhea Seehorn not even being nominated in favor of Jennifer Coolidge, and Coolidge winning, kind of boggles my mind."
Care Bears and Cousins,Redditors seething at yet another BCS snub in favor of Ozark.
Care Bears and Cousins,Really enjoyed this season of Abbott Elementary. Glad to see others did as well.
Care Bears and Cousins,"I cannot believe Sam Elliot won over Paul Walter Hauser, Evan Peters, Taron Egerton and Steve Carrell in the ""Male Actor in Miniseries or TV Movie"". He was, IMO, the worst choice in the whole category. I'm not saying he's a bad actor, but the other nominees were far, far better."
Care Bears and Cousins,The bear is the most stressful comedy I’ve ever watched.   Wait no i take that back. Space jam
Care Bears and Cousins,I can tell by these comments that the Abbott elementary backlash is about to start.
Care Bears and Cousins,I still haven't gotten around to *The Bear* but Jeremy Allen White must have been incredible to beat out Bill Hader for *Barry*.
Care Bears and Cousins,"In terms of best acting in a Comedy, hands down Abbott Elementary delivered great comedy acting. In terms of the best acting in that category though, it’s Barry without question. It just wasn’t really “comedy” this season 🤷🏼‍♂️

Same could be said for The Bear."
Care Bears and Cousins,I didn't know anything about Abbott Elementary until I heard about all their golden globe sweeps and I gave it a go and now it's one of my current fav shows and my main comfort happy place watch.
Care Bears and Cousins,"Abbott Elementary is perfectly *enjoyable*, but I'm still very surprised when they *win the big categories especially over the other shows listed."
Care Bears and Cousins,I dont get the love for white lotus.  I tried to watch it and it's just a show about shitty hotel guests?  Why not just watch reality tv?
Care Bears and Cousins,The White Lotus and Bear were phenomenal
Care Bears and Cousins,The awards need to get their shit together when it comes to comedy categories
Care Bears and Cousins,"Great to see Abbot winning ! It’s an amazing show and one of the few that I can sit and watch with my parents and we all enjoy together . 
More such shows please… please 🙏"
Care Bears and Cousins,"Ugh, Severance deserves better."
Care Bears and Cousins,The Bear was phenomenal
Care Bears and Cousins,[deleted]
Care Bears and Cousins,"The show bear makes you realize what a shitty career a chef is, extremely hard stressful job with little pay"
Care Bears and Cousins,As they should.
Care Bears and Cousins,"What am I missing with Abbott Elementary?  I watched the first few episodes and they were just, not good at all.  What is the charm I'm missing on this?"
Care Bears and Cousins,"Unpopular opinion here:  I watched The Bear and don’t really get what all the hype was about.  I mean I thought it was OK but nothing really above and beyond anything else I’ve seen the past year.  And before anyone says anything, yes I’ve worked in a restaurant before"
Care Bears and Cousins,"Why do people give a shit about Hollywood giving Hollywood bullshit awards as one massive circle-jerk?

I don't watch any of them, but the only that would mean anything to me at all would be Viewers' Choice Awards."
Care Bears and Cousins,"Sam Elliot's performance in 1883 winning over Paul Walter Hauser's performance in Black Bird is absolutely criminal. Sam Elliot just acted like Sam Elliot, Paul Walter Hauser became a cold-blooded killer."
Care Bears and Cousins,Crazy I've never even heard about all three shows
Care Bears and Cousins,Now there’s an award for sag?
Care Bears and Cousins,"Abbott Elementary is so overrated. It’s ok. If it came out in the 80s or 90s, it wouldn’t even be a blip on the radar."
Care Bears and Cousins,"My aging badge of honor is that I have never heard of these shows.  Ahhh, I remember fondly when I cared about TV, and wish I had the time."
Care Bears and Cousins,Looks like they rounded up 4 of the ugliest women in the audience and said do your worst smile
Care Bears and Cousins,"Really happy for Jessica Chastain, she was phenomenal as Tammy Wynette."
Care Bears and Cousins,I haven’t seen White Lotus yet but I have seen the other two shows and they are what I would quantify as “good watchable television” which is a standard that’s getting higher and higher with how much is being shown. I’m going to watch White Lotus.
Care Bears and Cousins,I really like Abbott Elementary.
Care Bears and Cousins,"She is fantastic, but the show isn’t going to hold up as she is all they have."
Care Bears and Cousins,"Wait, The Bear was a comedy? I must have been watching it wrong."
Care Bears and Cousins,"Not surprised *Stranger Things* won the Stunt award - it got the Stunt Coordination Emmy last year. Of particular note would be ""Dear Billy"", which included a one continuous shot gun battle and an impressive drop from height."
Care Bears and Cousins,That BCS lost to WL is a joke
Care Bears and Cousins,All great shows with a lot of variety. I would have gave Zendaya the win over Jennifer or BCS over WL ensemble
Care Bears and Cousins,"Jennifer Coolidge won as a dramatic actress? 

I'm so confused"
Care Bears and Cousins,Obvious for a drama ensemble. White lotus season 2 was a riot.
Care Bears and Cousins,I’m getting orange is the new black flashbacks after reading your comment
Care Bears and Cousins,It’s especially odd considering White Lotus was placed as a drama.
Care Bears and Cousins,"Yeah, every time I see The Bear listed as a comedy, I kind of do a double take. I guess there's some funny stuff, but even if it's a dark comedy, it's much more of a ***DARK*** (comedy), it seems to me."
Care Bears and Cousins,"And the award for best heavy metal album goes to...


...Jethro Tull

SAG awards are kinda like that."
Care Bears and Cousins,And the White Lotus in the drama category...
Care Bears and Cousins,Dark comedy to me
Care Bears and Cousins,C’mon cousin
Care Bears and Cousins,I downloaded it having heard nothing except that it was labelled as a “comedy” show with great reviews. Was confused and exhausted as fuck by the end of the first episode. Was expecting a relaxing laugh.
Care Bears and Cousins,"Historically, like from the Greeks, comedy just means it’s going to have a happy ending and is the opposite of tragedy"
Care Bears and Cousins,"In one episode they accidentally drugged a birthday party full of kids. That’s IASIP-type humor.

Yes, its a comedy."
Care Bears and Cousins,"Oh damn. He was good in shameless, and the bear is at 100% on rotten tomatoes. I need to check that out. No Hulu though"
Care Bears and Cousins,"HEARD, CHEF"
Care Bears and Cousins,Hulu better not fuck up and bring it back for season 2. They already canceled Reboot 😒
Care Bears and Cousins,SAG didn't seem to like GOT at any point.
Care Bears and Cousins,[deleted]
Care Bears and Cousins,"Because many of the top billed actors in GoT were mediocre at best.

Kit Harrington,
Emilia Clarke,
Sophie Turner,
Maisie Williams,
Nikolaj Coster-Waldau

They were doing fine in some scene or another maybe; but nothing memorable about their performances overall. Actually with Jon and Sansa it was as wooden acting as it gets all through. The show was a lot of fun but in terms of acting it was meh."
Care Bears and Cousins,It’s not an ensemble. composed of multiple PRINCIPLE actors and performers who are typically assigned roughly EQUAL AMOUNTS OF SCREEN TIME.
Care Bears and Cousins,"It really does feel weird to me that it’s being pushed so hard as a drama. Both seasons to me feel like 90% comedy with the last episode trying to go full dramatic tilt. 

It would be like trying to push the Righteous Gemstones as a drama or thriller instead of comedy purely because there are a few dramatic elements to it."
Care Bears and Cousins,Its beyond parody.
Care Bears and Cousins,And Jason Bateman winning for Ozark. SAGs are worse than the Golden Globes
Care Bears and Cousins,"Kudos to The White Lotus which has successfully jumped categories and is winning every guild award possible.  I don’t see it losing the Emmy for Best Drama later this year, and I thought the first season was better than the second lol.  Jennifer Coolidge and Mike White have a lot of voters everywhere rooting for them it seems.  HBO will have a hard time choosing which of its series to promote as Best Drama."
Care Bears and Cousins,It’s some sort of sick joke
Care Bears and Cousins,I like Coolidge but she didn't do anything we haven't seen her do 100 times before so I really don't see why she was even nominated
Care Bears and Cousins,"Yeah. I enjoyed White Lotus, but pretty much every other actor in that show was better than Jennifer Coolidge. She was fine, but she doesn't deserve an Emmy."
Care Bears and Cousins,I don't get the love for White Lotus. It was bland.
Care Bears and Cousins,I swear people around here only pay attention to award shows for validation of their own opinions. Any time something they want to win doesn’t win or get nominated the put on an Olympic level mental gymnastics performance of why instead of just accepting that not everyone thinks the same way as them. It’s sad really.
Care Bears and Cousins,[deleted]
Care Bears and Cousins,"It's a nice accurate representation of the school systems in black and brown communities. May not be the freshest directing style, but you don't see many comedies actually highlight this stuff."
Care Bears and Cousins,"I get that it highlights some big issues, but I just don’t find it funny at all. Lame jokes, writing that is too obvious and set ups that fall flat."
Care Bears and Cousins,"I haven’t liked it. It’s fine but not award-winning. Too many mediocre actors and too few surprising, original moments. To each their own though! At least it’s not a formulaic horseshit show like Big Bang Theory or 2.5 Men."
Care Bears and Cousins,"I have to agree, and I was a big fan of 1883 but Sam Elliot - played himself - again - the others played and transformed themselves into their characters. All these awards are a scam."
Care Bears and Cousins,Understandable. The stakes were high in Space Jam. Anyone who has ever balled out to defeat an evil cadre of basketball playing aliens probably had some flashbacks
Care Bears and Cousins,[deleted]
Care Bears and Cousins,Start? I feel like it’s been ongoing. Almost every day I see a low effort “DAE think Abbot Elementary is overrated?” post in this sub.
Care Bears and Cousins,Network shows and comfort food shows eill always do poorly on the internet.
Care Bears and Cousins,"Jeremy Allen White is reallllllly good in the Bear. He crushes a devastating monologue in the final episode of the season. But all season long he does a lot of small stuff so well and a weaker actor would've over acted when he went for subtleties. And when he does explode it feels so much more impactful.

Hader has been incredible, but he has gotten two Emmys for his acting in Barry. Would be a-ok if Jeremy Allen White got it."
Care Bears and Cousins,I think half the shows in the comedy categories are way more dramatic than comedy and are lucky they aren’t clocked as such … it’s kind of unfair to have two half jokes an episode and then super serious scenes that allow for range and dramatics the rest of the season and then get called a comedy.  Abbott is one of the only true intentional comedies this season and so I think their wins make complete sense.
Care Bears and Cousins,you don't have high quality writing and high end gays on reality tv
Care Bears and Cousins,Some of the acting wins were surprises.  Amanda Seyfried and Zendaya were rolling until now.
Care Bears and Cousins,And they wonder why ratings are dipping
Care Bears and Cousins,"For me, the show is enjoyable but not excellent in any way."
Care Bears and Cousins,"I haven’t seen it yet, but I’ve only heard good things about it from people I know. Not everyone is going like the same things though."
Care Bears and Cousins,"I quite like Abbott elementary, I think the relationships between characters is awesome and the show is warm and fun. Principal Ava is the best part of the whole thing though lol"
Care Bears and Cousins,"Nothing. I mean I think it does get better as the first season goes along, but it’s just parks & rec in a public school, and it’s fine. It’s enjoyable, occasional funny and warm moments, but it’s nothing new or innovative which I don’t believe all tv has to be, but I wouldn’t go giving it awards especially when it’s surrounded by other comedies that are doing all that."
Care Bears and Cousins,"Agreed, the constant looks towards the camera was a huge turn off to me"
Care Bears and Cousins,"I haven't watched it yet, but we all have different tastes.

The shows I think are mediocre to bad which are incredibly popular? Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, Breaking Bad, Scandal, That 70s Show, Seinfeld, Friends...

I could go on and on. It's okay not to like it."
Care Bears and Cousins,It drives discussion and gives a reason to reflect back on the year of projects that got realsed. It's a chance to help solidfy the long term appreciation for some of these projects.
Care Bears and Cousins,You’re not missing much
Care Bears and Cousins,She’s had a really good year.  Only the reigning Oscar winner could beat Amanda Seyfried.
Care Bears and Cousins,"Huh, is she leaving the show?"
Care Bears and Cousins,The bear as a comedy and white lotus as a drama…..i think its getting fucking obvious that genre-fencing is collapsing
Care Bears and Cousins,I binge watched it a while back and don’t remember laughing. I remember a dead family member and lots of yelling.
Care Bears and Cousins,"Listen cousin, I'm from that part of Chicago so it was a comedy to me and if you've got a problem with that we can take it outside and work it out. Then we'll come back in this kitchen and do our jobs normal like while everyone else shakes with anxiety and tiptoes around us awkwardly. You got that!

Honestly this is exactly the way my family acts. Scares my husband to death, he's constantly worried he's about to get his ass kicked. He hates going home to Chicago for a visit."
Care Bears and Cousins,For anyone who's worked in a kitchen... ya... definitely not a comedy.
Care Bears and Cousins,You think the scene with a bunch of kids who accidentally ingest downers and it’s laughed off would imply anything else?
Care Bears and Cousins,Dear Billy was the best ST episode ever
Care Bears and Cousins,"And again, Odenkirk & Laura Linney don’t win in a final season.  Just absolutely ridiculous. WL was great.  Bateman is great, but comparatively, and since it’s the last chance to do it, absolutely ridiculous, and even more that Rhea Seehorn wasn’t even nominated. 🙄"
Master of None,#ALLORRA
Master of None,Huh I didn't even realize they were working on a season 3. That's awesome.
Master of None,"Shit, I literally started watching it a month ago and just finished s2, assumed it was a relatively new show, had no idea it was almost 6 years old and that most people had already given up on a s3, now I'm excited"
Master of None,"Seems like a lot of people are expecting this to be a proper 3rd season continuing the story of Ansari's character, when it's more a spin-off season focusing on Lena Waithe's character. https://www.indiewire.com/2021/04/master-of-none-season-3-netflix-may-1234632012/"
Master of None,Wish we could’ve gotten the Harris whittels edition :(
Master of None,Not sure why the article refers to him as an American Indian instead of an Indian American.
Master of None,"This is going to be tough, season two was **so damn good**. To think they would be able to compete with that while filming in covid makes me nervous. 

* The ""**New York' I Love You**"" episode.
*  Bobby Cannavale's larger than life Chef Jeff stealing every scene he was in. 
* **Thanksgiving** episode with Lena Waithe!!
* Francesca, the Storm King date, John Legend at Chef Jeff's house.
* **The First Date** episode, fucking hell, fantastic. (Directed by Eric Wareheim)
* Arnold being Arnold and guiding Dev through the ""relationship"" *(""busy, beautiful, badass"")*
* Hell, even Clash of the Cupcakes was like the perfect dumb show for Dev to be in.

Damn, my fingers are crossed so hard. I can't wait."
Master of None,I SAID YOUR YAMS TURNED OUT REALLY NICE THIS YEAR! DID YOU ADD A LITTLE NUTMEG?
Master of None,"FYI: it’s not quite season 3. Apparently it’s called Master of None: Moments of Love and it’s focused on Lena Waithe’s character, Denise. Aziz directed all the episodes apparently!"
Master of None,Fucking finally!!!
Master of None,Big Bud and Little Bud are back!
Master of None,I'm honestly pretty excited for this. Those first two seasons were damn near perfect.
Master of None,"Love this show, if you guys like this show please check out Ramy as well."
Master of None,So they cancelled GLOW because Netflix couldn’t handle the long gap but they bring back Master of None after 5 years?
Master of None,I’m so excited to see the return of Arnold and his little buddy
Master of None,Fantastic I can’t wait
Master of None,"This show is like the next Curb. Just let the creators make a season whenever they feel like it with no pressure.

Edit: I'm comparing it to Curb in that Larry can just make a season whenever he wants without pressure from HBO. I'm not saying that *Master of None* is like Curb in regards to content."
Master of None,Great show. Sad Ansari’s life got off track like that.
Master of None,Fuck yes!
Master of None,Hopefully his parents are still in it. They remind me so much of my in-laws; really hits home
Master of None,I just watched the first episode of season 2 last night again. The episode is truly a work of cinema art IMO. What a fantastic show!
Master of None,"Finally, feels like it's been forever"
Master of None,Season two came out right after I went through a similar situation as Aziz did on the show. It was very cathartic for me. Can't wait so see season 2
Master of None,Such a good show!
Master of None,I want this so bad
Master of None,"I wasn’t a huge fan of Aziz before, but I freaking love this show. His parents (i know are real) are so cute."
Master of None,It will be a spinoff about one of Dev's friends. So I'm really not too invested on it
Master of None,I am so happy about this.
Master of None,"I look forward to another season of Aziz’s “awesome, rich, sleep with women way out of his league” adventure"
Master of None,I just re-binged the first two seasons. Very funny show amazing writing and camera work
Master of None,I just have to say I love this photo and the contrast in size between Aziz and Eric. Eric’s a giant!
Master of None,Amarsi Un Po is a perfect episode of television
Master of None,"A new season is my favorite thing, a new season is my favorite, thing!"
Master of None,"I found Aziz's character painful to watch in Parks and Rec, is this worth a watch?"
Master of None,I can’t wait
Master of None,I absolutely adore this show. I've never seen being in your mid to late 20's captured so perfectly.
Master of None,I did not expect to see a third season but I’m so excited!  This was one of my favorite shows that I can’t believe I mostly forgot about...
Master of None,"I loved the first two seasons, with news of a third season next month I am definitely going to rewatch the first two."
Master of None,"Was one of my fav shows as a single 26 year old,  but I’ve matured so much since S1 that I no longer find it funny. Hopefully his comedy has matured too."
Master of None,Allora!!
Master of None,One of the best TV shows of all time.
Master of None,"Wow, what a nice surprise"
Master of None,Hope it’s better than season 2.
Master of None,Welp. I know what I am going to binge now. Love this show. This is such great unexpected news.
Master of None,"Wow, I really forgot about this show. The comedy that forgot it was supposed to be funny."
Master of None,"Finally! Such a great show, can’t wait for season 3, it’s been wayyyy too long. I’m sure the wait will be worth it"
Master of None,Thought this dude was cancelled
Master of None,Couldn’t finish the first season. that shit was hacky. did it get better?
Master of None,"lets goooooooo! the first 2 seasons ended up one of my most rewatched shows, just too lovably fun!"
Master of None,Awesome show.  I'm really looking forward to this!
Master of None,Season 2 was such a letdown I don’t know if I’ll come back.  Can’t believe he fell into the unavailable pixie trope.
Master of None,"I didn’t even know they were filming. Last I heard, Aziz said he needed to experience more life or something before he could write more of the show.

This is great news! Master of None is so good!"
Master of None,Master of none is my fav-o-rite thing. Master of none is my fav-o-rite. THING.
Master of None,"Wasnt a bad show, but i think Aziz peaked in park and rec tough..."
Master of None,"Holy shit what 

This came out of left field and I love it"
Master of None,I hated what happened to him with a the accusations.
Master of None,And the crowd goes mild
Master of None,LETS F***ING GOOOOOOOOO YEA BABBTTTTTTTTTTTYYYYYY SUCH A GOOD SHOWWWW
Master of None,The whole “I’m in love with someone’s fiancé let me separate them and force her into this terrible conflict” felt infantile despite how funny the show was.
Master of None,Oh FFS why
Master of None,Yes please
Master of None,Yaaasssssssssss!
Master of None,Yay!
Master of None,At this point who wants to watch a depressed rich kid whine about how hard life is?  I prefer humor in my comedies...
Master of None,"Way overrated show, so many better shows have gotten the axe yet most of you will probably downvote this, just because you disagree. 
Wait  but that's the point to reddit...foggybrain"
Master of None,"I loved the first season. Watched the first episode of season 2 and barely made it through it. Haven't watched anymore, does it get better?"
Master of None,So it sounds like they went on hiatus until the metoo thing blew over.
Master of None,Who is asking for this?
Master of None,Hard pass
Master of None,"Finally, guys who ignore it when a woman says 'no' can have tv shows again."
Master of None,damn thats kinda shocking. figured it would be next year before we saw this.
Master of None,NAISE.
Master of None,I forgot about this show.
Master of None,Can’t wait that’s great love this show :). Going to invite a friend over and binge it :)
Master of None,"Seriously Netflix is announcing all my favorite shows for May

Amazing"
Master of None,Woot! 🥳
Master of None,"Yassssss!!!

This guy deserved it. Cancel culture did him wrong!"
Master of None,Yooo didnt this dude rape a girl? Oh no wait he was the guy that ordered the wrong wine.
Master of None,"Season 1 was some great tv but season 2 seemed way too agenda driven and muddled the context of the show.

Wonder if season 3 will be more of that?"
Master of None,🤢🤮
Master of None,WOW
Master of None,"I really enjoy this show. It pissed me off to no end when he was almost cancelled because of that woman. Luckily, even feminists realized how ridiculous that “accusation” was, but I understand his need to take a break after something like that happens to you. I also think a break was needed in order to think of something just as good or better than season 2, because it was golden"
Master of None,"Between this, Love,Death,Robots and Lucifer, I'm gonna be busy next month!"
Master of None,"This guy is an auteur and fairly visionary and I'm so thrilled for him because in our culture that lacks nuance with outrage, he definitely was accidentally swept up into it. I'm glad that we're finding a way to listen, and that we can accept apologies. His case was so blown out of proportion."
Master of None,"Cool, now can we get a new season of Louie??"
Master of None,"He’s still a bit rapey, and Eric Warheim’s manic energy has more than worn thin. PASS!"
Master of None,Unfunny boring stroke fest. I laughed one time the entire first season. The bar has been set so low this gets renewed for more seasons.
Master of None,"Let’s not forget why it took so long. Some woman willingly had sex with Ansari, decided afterwards she made a mistake & went all #metoo on him. Almost ruined his career, because she was an idiot."
Master of None,This is an outrage! A wamen said something bad about him. I demand he be cancelled!
Master of None,But!.....but!?....he flirted with a girl once!
Master of None,So glad Aziz’s bad date didn’t ruin his career.
Master of None,[deleted]
Master of None,[deleted]
Master of None,that the little rapey guy that did the pizza skit on snl?  he’s funny...
Master of None,"Will he creepily ask his romantic interest: ""Can we have sex? Can we have sex? Can we have sex? Can we have sex? Come on let's have sex! Can we have sex?"" in his annoying chipmunk voice? Find out next month on S3."
Master of None,Yes! I loved season 2.
Master of None,"Fucking finalllyyyyy. Just finished rewatching it for the 3rd time, so this is great timing!"
Master of None,Prego mille!
Master of None,"It’s. About. Time! 

I was so worried we’d never see this."
Master of None,needed this
No Game No Life,"I know hes done a lot of stuff over the years, but his appareance on [It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia](https://youtu.be/-U1yb7PQw4o) is one of the funniest things I've ever seen and I will always remember him for it."
No Game No Life,"Despite a chaotic life w/ severe issues, & wandering through substance abuse a few times, he is & was a creative talent & strong screen presence. Today my intent is to recall where I’ve seen him in the screen.

He was always a great supporting character. 

Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man (1991), Passenger 57 (1992), True Romance (1993), Natural Born Killers (1994), Strange Days (1995), Heat (1995), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Red Planet (2000), Black Hawk Down (2001), Pearl Harbor (2001) and the revival television series Twin Peaks (2017), and for voicing Sonny Forelli in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.

Very sad to hear doctors saying there is no hope for Sizemore to rebound from the aneurysm & stroke. God bless, hope he is feeling comfortable, safe & loved."
No Game No Life,"Brain aneurysms are terrifying. A kid in high school started complaining of a headache one morning. Bad enough to go to the nurse by lunch. You could hear him crying out in pain by the end of lunch (it was a small school). He was dead by that evening. 

Any time I’ve gotten a serious headache since I hear his cries echoing down the school hallway (it was a small school, we had one hallway)."
No Game No Life,"""For me, the action is the juice."""
No Game No Life,"There was this moment on Celebrity Rehab Season 3 where Tom was bawling while watching a video showing everyone in rehab when they were young. While he's being comforted he cries ""did you see how young we used to be? did you see how young we used to be?""

The way he was clearly mourning both youth, innocence, and everything he had lost during his life shook me as a kid. A haunting mix of crushing regret and amazement at remembering who he once was."
No Game No Life,My sister met him at a half way house visiting her friend going through something similar around like 2003/2004.She said  he was very kind and gave her a very  dated headshot with him on a Harley and signed it for her. Dudes a tortured artist addiction sucks and when you think your in the clear health complications come at you.
No Game No Life,"Well, that's certainly sad news. :("
No Game No Life,Most recently saw him in a rep screening of Strange Days. Fucking presence and a half. This sucks.
No Game No Life,I still remember him acting alongside Johnny Knoxville in *Big Trouble*. It was always such a fun movie and he really owned his scenes.
No Game No Life,"The interview he did on Howard Stern around...2007? Maybe ? Where he is obviously on or comming off something was a shame to see . ( they used to show some interviews of the Stern show on a video subscription service ) . He had sweated through his dress shirt so badly they gave him a new one mid interview.

He was such a great actor . Great in Private Ryan."
No Game No Life,He is so god damn funny in True Romance for few minutes of screen time he has
No Game No Life,"Such a huge screen presence and immensely talented dude, all struggles aside. So bummed for him and his family but grateful for all his great work he shared with us."
No Game No Life,Sad news :(
No Game No Life,RIP
No Game No Life,"Damn. I thought he’d at least outlive Gary Busey. Great actor, wish he had beaten his demons"
No Game No Life,"I know he had his personal demons but damn what an ugly way to go, especially at age 61. RIP Tom."
No Game No Life,""" For me, the Action is the Juice""- Michael Cherrito


When I look back at his body of work, I am astounded at all the amazing films he was a part of. RIP a true badass. 


What an amazing career."
No Game No Life,The dude had some severe abise problems. On Celebrity rehab he was down pretty bad
No Game No Life,"""Captain, if your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset..... """
No Game No Life,RIP to Nick mullens dear friend
No Game No Life,Tom Sizemore made acting look easy. Such an amazing talent like he wasn’t even trying as he played great supporting character after character in so many movies. His onscreen chemistry with Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan is a masterclass for anyone aspiring to be a great supporting actor. I’m going to miss seeing this guy onscreen. After his lowest low he worked hard to keep it clean for many years. That should be an inspiration in it of itself for many struggling today.
No Game No Life,Rest In Peace Sarge.
No Game No Life,"Yesterday I was watching ""Saving Private Ryan"" and today this news."
No Game No Life,"For as troubled of a life as he lived, he still managed to make it to 61. I know that’s still pretty young, but I doubt that he ever expected to make it to this age. I hope that the stigma of his substance abuse and addiction will fade and that the true brilliance of his ability will forever shine as his legacy. I hope and wish that his passing is as pain free and peaceful as possible. ❤️"
No Game No Life,"Lana: What's your third biggest fear? 
 
Archer: Brain aneurysm. 
 
Lana: What's a brain aneurysm have to do with walking around in a swamp? 
 
Archer: Nothing, it can happen anywhere at anytime, that's what makes it so terrifying"
No Game No Life,"Whats more tragic, the news or OP karma whoring every big story on this subreddit. Like it’s seriously all the top page news is by one user"
No Game No Life,RIP.. Some people just have IT. Whatever IT is you notice it immediately and never forget it. He probably could have been as big as any actor of his time if it weren't for his demons. But maybe that's what makes them great... Not unlike Philip Seymour Hoffman.
No Game No Life,"Thats sad to hear :(

I spent many hours editing his dialogue for an indie film “Durants Never Closes” (last check was on prime video). The set was in an echo chamber and writing was low low budget, but Tom’s performance was great.

I forced my friends to watch it and suffer some of my pain"
No Game No Life,Black hawk down and saving private Ryan are 2 of my favourite films.. neither would be the same without him!
No Game No Life,"Ah damn, fucking shame. I know the dude had crazy problems, I hope he had some peace in the past few years"
No Game No Life,"That sucks but, if it is the right decision them they should be able to make it without any backlash."
No Game No Life,Any day you can go. It’s just the reality of life. We aren’t going to make it.
No Game No Life,"Well talk about highs and lows, from being a great supporting actor, to drugs and being a porn star, he lived it all."
No Game No Life,"This is how my dad died, it's such a traumatic experience for the family so my thoughts are with them. I'll always love him for his roles, especially as Milo in Heart and Soul is where I first saw him as a kid.

Especially this iconic scene: https://youtu.be/65eOaOTeyng"
No Game No Life,"61 years old, crap. That's pretty much my age..."
No Game No Life,He was one of the most underrated actors of his generation. NBK would be nothing without him.
No Game No Life,"First noticed him in Devil In A Blue Dress. After that I looked for Tom Sizemore credits in movies. If he was in it, I was watching it. I’m amazed how many really good movies he’s in.

He’s already missed."
No Game No Life,True romance. Stand out performance. Surprised more people haven't seen that movie.
No Game No Life,Man had a rough life. Very sad.
No Game No Life,"“Well ya know, for me, the action is the juice. I’m in.”

https://youtu.be/t2ojmr1gDrY"
No Game No Life,Nothing takes 5 minutes.
No Game No Life,"“ I like this Clarence kid, this f*cking guy is crazy!”"
No Game No Life,I saw him way back on the celebrity rehab show. Heartbreaking
No Game No Life,"“I gotta a pocket full of cash and a heart full of desire.. it’s like a mailbox, you open it up and put whatever you want inside.” His always sunny appearance is something I’ll never forget"
No Game No Life,Damn. That’s awful. He’s probably my favorite character in Saving Private Ryan.
No Game No Life,"He's a really great actor, even though he wasn't a major star his screen presence was undeniable. Loved him in enemy of the state and saving private Ryan."
No Game No Life,Really liked him in black hawk down and saving private ryan
No Game No Life,Sizemore was so GOOD. I don't understand how he was so wasted most of the time but shooting a movie he was great. He worked a lot too.
No Game No Life,Damn I knew Major Toms brain would eventually explode from all the blow he did
No Game No Life,How come no one’s mentioned his XXX career? He brought a professionalism into porn like Felini  in 9mm
No Game No Life,Karma finally came to claim him. I have no sympathy for domestic abusers.
No Game No Life,A voice of my childhood. That was my money Tommy!
No Game No Life,"No matter his past issues,he is/was a talented actor.My 2 Favorite roles were in Heat and SPR.He always played the badass/No BS characters who had their bosses back,like the way Horvath went after Reiben.Top Honorable Mention goes to his part in Black Hawk Down as the Commander.Very sad news."
No Game No Life,His cameo in Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia was funny as hell.
No Game No Life,"Damn, didn’t even know he was hospitalized."
No Game No Life,This deeply saddens me. I just watched Strange Days for the first time Saturday. Had no idea he had such a large role. Killer flick
No Game No Life,"Loved him in The Relic as the superstitious detective in Chicago, or with Robert Downey Jr in Hearts and Souls."
No Game No Life,RIP Tommy
No Game No Life,"Oh man, Sgagnetti!"
No Game No Life,"Great actor, troubled man. I enjoyed his performances but wish he had found peace."
No Game No Life,"I remember the utter crucifixion this guy went through whenever he was going through the worst parts of his struggle with addiction. He was a great actor, had some personal demons, but his actions then seem to kinda pale in comparison to what some actors do these days and get away with with seemingly nothing more than a slap on the wrist from production teams."
No Game No Life,"This is sad. I know he had his issues but some of his body of work is fantastic. I loved him as The Gent in Hellride.

[EDIT] Omg, I'm an idiot. That was Michael Madson and not Tom. Regardless, Tom was great."
No Game No Life,darn 61 is too young for anyone
No Game No Life,A friend of mine died in the 5th grade from one of these. Still can hit home as we weren’t ready for that kind of thing at age 10-11.
No Game No Life,"True Romance, Natural Born Killers, Heat, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, Enemy of the State....etc....no matter how big or small the role, he always was 100% and was always memorable.  It's so awful how addiction got a hold of him and just wouldn't let go. I have always rooted for him."
No Game No Life,I thought he was dead long ago. Lots of addiction issues
No Game No Life,"I will always remember his cameo in Point Break. The way he says ""3 months"" has been seared into my brain ever since I saw the film in the 90s. I also just watch The Relic where he plays one of the most believable cops to come out of the late 90s."
No Game No Life,"He was so good in Saving Private Ryan, it’s sad to lose his talent"
No Game No Life,Damn. He’s one of the best supporting actors in the business IMO. So many great films that his performances contributed to in a big way.
No Game No Life,"A friend of mine directed a movie he was in about 5 or 6 years ago and had nothing but wonderful things to say. Even though it was a low budget horror flick, he treated it like any other movie and gave it his all."
No Game No Life,Great actor.  I hope he found peace before the stroke.  I hope he knows how many fans he had of his work.
No Game No Life,I’m not one who thinks someone should have their sins follow them the rest of their life - but I never looked at the guy the same after [this story was published.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/tom-sizemore-was-removed-movie-set-allegedly-violating-11-year-old-girl-1057629/amp/)
No Game No Life,Really enjoyed his performance in The Relic.
No Game No Life,The family is asking for privacy at this time so we published an article detailing the private happenings and agonizing decision they’re being asked to make by doctors.
No Game No Life,I have empathy for his family but not much else. He was a despicable human. There are credible accusations of him being asked to leave a production he was in after he molested an 11 year old girl with multiple witnesses present. And inb4 people say he struggled with addiction and had his demons; there’s no excuse for doing something like that.
No Game No Life,"I can’t believe he has lived this long. Either way, thanks for entertaining us Tom."
No Game No Life,"Ive always been torn because he’s in one of my fav movies, Strange Days. But he also molested a child and or children. So yeah…"
No Game No Life,It’s sad that all his achievements are diminished by being an abuser.
No Game No Life,Fuck this dude. He was a child molester
No Game No Life,"Shame, great actor but also a real piece of shit."
No Game No Life,"Everyone so torn up by this should look up his interactions with a little girl sitting on his lap during a photo shoot for a film some years back: “This is when Sizemore allegedly either rubbed his finger against the girl's vagina or inserted it inside.”

Oh yeah such a shame though."
No Game No Life,"Spousal abuser and child molester. Honestly, pretty hard to have sympathy for the guy."
No Game No Life,He's beaten his last girlfriend
No Game No Life,"Sad news, but wanted to point out that Sizemore was also a spousal abuser. We can’t deify Sizemore on the one hand, while demonizing Chris Brown on the other. Sad news, loved the films he acted in, but this was also a man who beat women and I don’t fuck with people like that."
No Game No Life,I can never see Tom Sizemore and not think of [the fart hole.](https://youtu.be/jYkdFS8n_GA)
No Game No Life,Great actor. Shitty at being human. RIP
No Game No Life,I always get Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen mixed up.
No Game No Life,Godspeed you legend. May we meet again on the celestial shores.
No Game No Life,I’ll always remember him as the guy that banged Paris Hilton. Shine on you crazy diamond.
No Game No Life,[deleted]
No Game No Life,I thought he died years ago.  Sad either way.
No Game No Life,"In 2000, my boss and good friend had a brain aneurysm.  It was catastrophic. Somehow, she lived, and had been in recovery since. She just began to release must've online, and I couldn't be more proud.

I'm going to call her this week."
No Game No Life,I wanna be next
No Game No Life,"He is a vegetable right now, his brain looks like mashed potatoes in an MRI. There's no reason to use machines to keep the rest of his organs going when his corpse would die without them."
No Game No Life,Terrible news.  Love Tom’s various characters.  Truly a great actor.  My love and support ti his family during these difficult times
No Game No Life,What's he been in?
No Game No Life,Glad to know I still have 15 years to live
No Game No Life,"Canadas MAID laws help in this situation.* Some People hit a point where their life will be endless hell till they die. Assisted Suicide is a compassionate thing to do. This Canadian supports it. It has its uses, people going out on their own terms, instead of being a potato, pooping their pants all day. 
We can help people.

*Edited to be less of a flippant ass and actually open conversation about the topic of Assisted Dieing."
No Game No Life,The dude was a child molester. He’s lucky he didn’t die in prison.
No Game No Life,"i always kind of liked him, until he picked up that kid to use as a shield in ""heat"".

condolences to his family."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"I only saw season 1, but I remember being so upset when janine garafalo (that's probably how it's spelt) left halfway during the season. She was my favourite character and it just wasn't the same without her. Did she quit, was she fired? "
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Was this always on Bravo?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Hope you all enjoy. Twas fun to shoot.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Same here. She just up and left! I couldn't stand the new woman they  brought in to replace her. =[ 
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"> secretly hiding her separation from her husband 

Wait, what? That sentence makes no sense. I think he would probably figure it out. "
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Marti Noxon is a really good television writer.  I'll give what she does a chance.  I'm probably not the target audience for this show...  but she's one of the people I root for.  I'll check it out.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"My god this is beautiful, thank you. 

Now we just need these services to allow us to create custom playlists so I can make a Thanksgiving episode playlist with all my favorite shows and shuffle through them."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Pretty sure I don't get enough time off for this list! 

Well done, OP."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Also for Frasier: “The Apparent Trap” (Season 7, Episode 9)"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,I’d like to nominate The League S3 E8 - Thanksgiving to be added to the list
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,This is amazing! I tired to do something similar for Christmas last year with the shows on Hulu/Netflix. Like someone else mentioned I wish these services would let up build custom playlists.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Give this OP a turkey.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,So is MST3K's Turkey Day just not a thing anymore?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Get this guy a Pupper’s
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Roseanne had some pretty classic Thanksgiving episodes (from the original run, before she lost her mind)"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,No Bob's burger's?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Thank you for this and Happy Thanksgiving in advance!
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,The Danish streaming service Viaplay just did exactly this for Halloween. I saw a custom playlist they made of all Halloween episodes of all TV shows they currently have.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Or just get Plex
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,I've just started watching Friaser for the first time and just got to this episode! What a show that still stands up!
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"They did one on Hulu this year for Halloween with Bobs burgers but it didn’t work correctly and just booted you back to the main menu for the show, then it disappeared right before Halloween! I was so bummed! We want holiday episodes streaming services! We want them all bundled so we can just hit play and drown in our holiday memories."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,It still is. They stream the marathon on their teotch channel now.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,I love the one where Bob has to keep buying a turkey because they end up in the toilet. His interactions with the guy at the store are hilarious.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,It's there between Jane the Virgin and Raymond
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Weird plex but okay.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Oh you are so lucky to experience that for the first time! It’s easily my favorite show of all time!
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"I guess they meant why it's not included on *this* list. I suppose it's because these are Thanksgiving-themed episodes, and MST3K is a (albeit highly enjoyable) marathon of random episodes that's airing on Thanksgiving."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,It's weird I loved the show but so much of it made no sense and didn't connect lol
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Lol. It's called a relationship in which they should never have gotten married even though they loved each other. And well enjoyed doing it. Hate to tell you, that is normal."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,There’s a time to be done and they made it seem like they were. Then suddenly they’re all smiles. Didn’t track well.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,People are so stupid.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Good. What a POS.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,What a gross thing to do.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Holy fucking loser Batman
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,I hate everything about this headline.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Good. Fucking loser
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Who and who?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Never heard of him.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,As he should. If not more…
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,[removed]
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Nasty bastard
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Link?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Lame.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Remindme! 2 hours
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,20000 channels here
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,*Sigh*
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,See ya
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Loozah!
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can’t help themselves.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Good
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Surely that should be ‘celebrity’ Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,What a douche.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Picture checks out
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Disgusteng
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Neck tattoos…
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a “celebrity?”
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Both of them are a waste of space
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,And he published non-consensual photos and videos with his ex. So well deserved!

Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,He’s probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Girlfriends Guide to Divorce,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn’t already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"

Little Lunch,"Cancer scares the fuck out of me. I always think I'm going to die in my 70s or 80s. Eh, kids can get cancer. If something else doesn't kill me, I'll get it eventually. Might have it now and not know.


Fuck, I have good insurance. I'm going to start getting full workups on a regular basis."
Little Lunch,"Grandma had pancreatic cancer decades ago.  Caught it randomly from another procedure- idk what as I wasn't alive then.

She just turned 86."
Little Lunch,What were the symptoms?
Little Lunch,I think you mean detected? I did a double-take at the word caught.
Little Lunch,"My husband just felt some cramping in his stomach area after a work out. It came and went over the course of a few months - it took him 5 months to go get an endoscopy because it wasn’t that bad or frequent. At that point it was far too late. The cramping was caused by a “gargantuan bleeding tumor” (in the words of the doctor). He had a whipple the next month, followed by 3 years of intense chemo and other unpleasantness before he passed away. The doctor originally gave him 12-18 months."
Little Lunch,I too am curious and scared.
Little Lunch,Death
Little Lunch,A little sleepy post-lunch and early afternoon.
Little Lunch,"My grandmother had it. She was jaundice by the time they caught it. Think it was 2 weeks before she passed.  
  
Usually there aren't any discernable symptoms. That's what makes it so deadly.  
  
It's very rare to have it at 47 like that man. Usually it's old people.  
  
Don't smoke, don't be overweight, make sure you properly take care of yourself if you have diabetes. That's all you can do"
Little Lunch,They both mean the same thing
Little Lunch,So.....everybody on the planet has symptoms?
Little Lunch,You’re entitled to like or dislike any show you want but reading your post it’s honestly kind of incredible how much of the show flew right over your head.
Little Lunch,"Yes yes.  We really don’t need a dissertation on how much you have terrible taste in tv shows.


Also you clearly didn’t understand BB or BCS."
Little Lunch,Tell me again
Little Lunch,">No meaningful cost, either tangible or intangible, is incurred by Jimmy or Kim.

I'm pretty Damn sure Kim *is* the cost and it's been building to that this whole time."
Little Lunch,Your inability to enjoy something doesn't make it overrated.
Little Lunch,This is a bad take. You clearly don't understand the show.
Little Lunch,"There's a lot in here that implies you've seriously misunderstood Jimmy as a character, but your take on Kim is borderline insulting.  The show has been exploring Kim's motivations since day one.  She was consistently portrayed in the earlier seasons as someone who deeply values fairness and personal willpower, but is self-sabotagingly confident/egotistical.  These principles were all slowly twisted by her increasing disillusionment with her professional life and the endless complications of her personal life.  Over the course of the show, she's slowly corrupted all of these moral stances into justifications for pretty reprehensible actions, both out of a desire to maintain her relationship with Jimmy, and as a way to exert her agency in the legal world.  The way the justifications slowly overtook the original moral positions throughout seasons 4 and 5 is honestly some of the richest character writing I've ever seen.  Of course, if you just see Jimmy as an unsympathetic sociopath who deserves every emotional bodyblow he's received throughout the show, you're going to struggle to empathize with Kim, apparently to the degree where her marriage proposal will somehow seem less agentic than Skyler fucking Ted."
Little Lunch,"Wrong sub, here you go:

r/unpopularopinion"
Little Lunch,""" he witnessed his father being a pushover who handed money to grifters, and it's because of this that Jimmy became who he is""

actually no, that scene was meant to show us jimmys character, not be the foundation / origin of it."
Little Lunch,You seem to have a child’s understanding of even Breaking Bad.
Little Lunch,Tldr you're stupid
Little Lunch,No you just don't understand the show
Little Lunch,How in the world are you going to complain about plausibility while lauding breaking bad lol
Little Lunch,"You end the 1st paragraph of your critique with ""There was never a free lunch in Breaking Bad."" I automatically have a problem with most shows that insist on that biblical justice trope of good triumphing over evil. It's bullshit, and all the shows that pump christian morality at us are pointless propaganda. BCS employing an ambiguity over any cast members moral stance is more true to human nature. Although in reality, Saul's flash forward clips in black and white appear to have him living a lower quality of life later on. It's trajectory may end up closer to your required lunch cost than my preferred occasional getting away with it."
Little Lunch,"Don't know why so many ppl are so pressed lol the show is not perfect so I think some criticism is valid. Redditors like to act like the show can do no wrong and is the best thing ever written but that's not true. Personally, I like the show, but I don't think it's on the same level as Breaking Bad. There is a reason it's not as popular as BB was at its peak. Everyone has their opinions though and that's fine!"
Little Lunch,Just say you don't like it. Its fine move on.
Little Lunch,im 100% with you. the show is too convenient for the sake of being convenient. All the side characters feel like npc. BCS is nowhere near being a good show and miles apart from Breaking Bad.
Little Lunch,To all those saying OP doesn't understand the show: that's a weak ass response.  He makes valid points that none of you address or directly respond to.
Little Lunch,"Jimmy doesnt work as a main character, he should've stayed as the additional cast of comic relief, whenever him and kim are on screen shit's so boring"
Little Lunch,"Just finished the last episode five minutes ago and agree w this assessment 100%.  Really nailed it.  Great analysis!  

P.S. I went looking if I were alone in thinking this show was WAAY overrated.  BB and The Wire are my fav TV shows of all time.  This was a major disappointment.  I also think the writers had to write around Bob Odenkirk.  He's not a leading man, he's a supporting player -- wh may have something to do w why his character failed so much as a protagonist. Heck the writers gave up on him/his character and they pretty much made Kim the protagonist in Season 6.  Odd show."
Little Lunch,"And the depiction of Kim in the last few eps rang hallow to me.  She suddenly becomes a Stepford Wife and marries a boring (and unattractive) guy as a self-loathing form of jail. Okay but then everyone in her work-group gets the memo and they all look and act out of 1964. Did Olivia Wilde suddenly direct the Florida storylines or what?  Btw, this is what the writers think Americans who work in office parks look like.  Uh, okay..."
Little Lunch,"If you don't like the show, Then don't watch it. Some people liked it, Some not, This happens with every other show..."
Little Lunch,Kim Wexler is a great character
Little Lunch,Better Call Saul boring overrated show.
Little Lunch,"Yeah i had a problem with jimmys characters on better call saul as well. I literally came here after googling "" better call saul isnt good"" Lol. When i was watching the first season. I too expected to see a saul goodman that was either going to decide to start, or get better at being a slickster because of how tired he was of his life. All the while watching the things he does, while not right, be understandable. And doing this in a way that reflects HIS character. 

In breaking bad I saw saul as a man who was comfortable being who he was. Because he seemed to be be a man who knew who he was! He knew he was a two bit slickster with a silver tounge. But he seemed at peace with that because he seemed in my eyes, to be a man who accepted the world is a crudy place. And you have to decide how you want to handle that. Everyone does. In my opinion the people who do have a easier go at it because they can carve out a uniqueness that lets them handle no situation the exact same as even someone with a similiar general personality. 

My impression of saul as a result of the statement above, seemed to be a man who decide that he would balance out on the negative end of the moral tightrope. But not so far on that side that he would forget who he was. At least unless he was hard pressed. As sleazy as he was he instantly seemed like a man who had a code. While still living based on his acceptance of his world view. ""Most ppl cant be all ""good"" in this world and expect to win."" You have to bend the rules with skill and sometimes you have to look out for number 1"" 

But despite his character screaming that life perspective. I couldnt help but easily sense he still had a conscience. On top of not being a very aggresive person and being comic relief in the breaking bad. And i think this combo is what made him so attractive as a character. This is proven time and time again as we see jessie and walt come to Saul for help, and while his dealings are in the underworld. This is what precisely allows him to aid walt and jessie time and time again. Because one, he has some moral ambiguity. But also two, he's obviously skillful enough to have succeded in a world of moral ambiguity and still keep his core values in tact while not allowing himself to become plain evil, insane. Or just some who he doesnt imagine himself to be.

I wanted to see this unfold in better call saul. How did he succesfully become a king of con men, in this world of submerged evil, drugs, theft and murder, but still keep being himself. Or maybe he only had a piece of himself at the beginning, and he had to decide how he was going ro solidify himself if he was going to make it , not just in the world. But in that world. Better call saul just took all of that mystery and seem to turn jimmy into a psuedo walt but with a scummier face mask. Just my 2 cents"
Little Lunch,"It is overrated, overhyped and painfully boring. There's no need to waste so much time in scenes that could've been two or three times shorter and still get to the point. Three seasons could've been two easily if written/edited well. Episodes are 45+ minutes, that means that short ones could've been 30-35 minutes. Just imagine that.  


BCS is pure fan service for BB fandom. Acting is good, not amazing as all fanboys want to believe. Mike subplot felt for 3-4 seasons way too detached from Jimmy's. Show's call Better Call Soul and sure, it's nice and necessary to see the evolution of him to become Saul Goodman, but 4 season for that? Too long. Chuck character is obnoxious, and yet again another cartoonish character in the Vince Gilligan universe. Remove his electricity sh$% and half the plot is gone.   


At the end of the day, the show is another Vince Gilligan classic antihero show. This was Breaking Bad 2.0, but more boring. I can't believe some are calling it the best show ever. What the fc$% have they watched?"
Little Lunch,"it’s just mid, plan and simple"
Little Lunch,I completely respect your right to be so very very wrong.
Little Lunch,Any popular show is overrated if you don't like it
Little Lunch,"It's not bad But I do think it's really overrated. I've seen some people unironically say it's better than Breaking Bad which to me is literally impossible.

I stopped watching after season 4, there is just no big thing to keep you going since it's not a thriller and you already know the outcome."
Little Lunch,"I agree that it's overrated, but I'm still watching it. Breaking Bad was much better. BCS is painfully slow at times."
Little Lunch,"Okay, you win. You've given the single worst take on this subreddit. Congratulations on your abysmal taste and complete failure to understand complex writing. 

This whole post reads like a manifesto on why you aren't very bright lmfao."
Little Lunch,"I kinda agree, post-Chuck at least. It feels much more like a show about hi-jinks than the sort of deeper character studies we got in Breaking Bad. Those happen to be incredibly enjoyable, watchable hi-jinks, but without the brother drama it lacks something.

I think the cartel parts are now the more interesting parts."
Little Lunch,Thanks for the write up. I only watched the first few episodes but I think if Jimmy had been more of a clean lawyer at the start of the series instead of already a con artist I might have been more interested.
Little Lunch,"I think BCS is at par, if not better than BB. Most of the credit goes to the solid actors, they bring those characters to life, and ofcourse the writing and direction. The reason BCS clicked was because  -  

- we already liked Saul, because he provided the crooked comedy tangent to the already grim and serious show BB.
- in one way or the other, we all instantly recognized a character like Saul in our real lives. Crooked to the core, high handedness, cocky and greedy.
- did I say how incredibe the acting was?
- we saw why Saul was the way he was.
- most of us(boys?) fell in love with Kim. Mature, incredibly intelligent and a go getter.
- we loved to hate some characters, who later may have made some of us cry( when they died on the show)
- gus fring's rise and hector's(well deserved) punishment 
- Mike, need I say more?
- the much awaited and applauded returns from Hank, Gomes, Marie( I thought we'll also see Skyler, but all good) and ofcourse Jesse and Heisenberg himself.

You know what, I just realized the bullet points will number in hundred if I go on. But I hope you got the point. The show provided most of us folks, who toil hard for a living, an A+ entertainment, which is a much needed respite. I won't go overboard and say, that these shows are the best of all time. But for me, It was a time well wasted."
Little Lunch,"Bro what…. Litterally answers so much questions  and details about the show, it’s set up with perfect sequencing and less than generic formula…funny u got 0 upvotes 🤣"
Little Lunch,What I would have done is made Saul an allegory for the greatest con man of all time -- Donald Trump.  And just hit all his major beats of Trump's life w Saul's backstory -- the audience would have had fun to make that connection.
Little Lunch,I liked BCS but it's not anywhere near the level of BB. The only thing on the show that made me feel something was seeing what happened to Howard because it was shocking but most of the time it's just a lot of filler in between the high points with the cartel stuff. I could rewatch BB constantly and its brilliant but I'd never return to watch BCS for any reason after viewing it once.
Little Lunch,"this is a pretty shallow reading of the show imo, and the way that it misses the mark with jimmy, chuck, and kim is wild to me.

jimmy is extremely unsociopathic. he is very invested in how other people feel about him and cares deeply about people in his life like chuck and kim. 

to say the show doesnt give him consequences is wild to me: every season opens with a reminder of how everything he did in both shows has lead him to a dead end life on the run in nebraska. characterising chucks death as a ""win"" for jimmy is just very weird. jimmy spends basically the rest of the show repressing his grief on that one, and its implied that his biggest regret was the permanent burning of that bridge.

i find kim to be a really engaging character, in the way that she shifts from acting as a kind of moral compass for jimmy to being intoxicated by the thrill of a successful scheme just like he is. personally i really enjoy how while jimmy has a really poorly developed sense of right and wrong, largely operating on the level of fucking over people he views as bad, kim has much loftier ideals and has to struggle with her failing sense of faith in the system and the tantalising prospect of using illegal means to secure ""justice"" (which culminates in their final con, where she has to contend with how she was doing it for fun).

i actually agree that bcs is overrated. i think it has pacing issues and  characters like mike and gus spend a lot of the series fairly stagnant. taking issue with the character writing of the 3 best written characters on the show is wild to me tho"
Little Lunch,I agree that Better Call Saul is overrated but your reasoning is laughably bad.
Little Lunch,"did you watch the same shows as us? 😂 bro was watching metastasis, 
Bro watched breaking good lmao

Seriously it sounds like a problem on YOUR end. You seem very frustrated at the fact that you didn’t understand anything and that’s fine , I know people to vent their frustration thru writing too. you don’t gotta watch it but I’d give it a rewatch some time if I were you, and this time around I wouldn’t be preoccupied with making the cure for cancer which you obviously must’ve been doing while breaking bad/ better call Saul played in the background"
Little Lunch,"Yeah it's a great example of someone just completely misinterpreting and misunderstanding what they are watching. It's honestly hard to believe that it's real, so many of these reasons are just...wrong."
Little Lunch,"Seriously. Kim's backstory for example. She's closer to Walter White than Saul. The devastation of the relationships. The brothers, the sheer brutality of what Chuck did to Jimmy, over and over again. More violent than if he had shot him. The evolution or de-evolution of Kim, who seems to be the good person at the beginning. She shows her ""bad"" side as mischief at first. Before we ever know her history, and before we ever see how dark she gets. So bad that Saul is shocked.

OP must be watching a different show."
Little Lunch,Exactly the words to describe this Declaration of Independence they wrote . So much of everything absolutely flew over their head lol
Little Lunch,"""wahhh if someone disagrees with me they have terrible taste"""
Little Lunch,"Instead of being so aggressive and insultingly dismissive you should use arguments to rebut your opponent...or didn't you learn anything in school (see, everyone can make dumb ad hominems)"
Little Lunch,Shut your elitist ass up.
Little Lunch,"wow how this the top comment, eliteism over a fucking tv show is a special kinda pathetic tbh"
Little Lunch,[removed]
Little Lunch,"That is an outrageous thing to say about Better Call Saul, that Kim and Jimmy are incurring no meaningful cost for their actions. It couldn't be more laughably wrong."
Little Lunch,"Chuck was the cost, Jimmy's soul was the cost, Mike's son was the cost etc.etc. lots of drama around these selfish decisions"
Little Lunch,Then his point is valid and it should have been an 8 episode mini- series it at most a two season show
Little Lunch,as if your ability to enjoy makes it a good show?
Little Lunch,"Ive seen shouts for best show of all time, and objectively its not close, like at all. And if you say anything bad about it to a bcs fan they freak out, like no other fan base"
Little Lunch,"I have an ""inability to enjoy it"" precisely because it's a terrible show with terrible writing."
Little Lunch,"I love how everyone insists I don't ""understand the show"" without rebutting a single one of my points. 

Perhaps the show defies understanding because the writing is so incoherent. Like, imagine a German engineer doing business with a drug lord, only to completely risk his and his family's life by running away because.....he missed his wife."
Little Lunch,">were all slowly twisted by her increasing disillusionment with her professional life and the endless complications of her personal life

Pretty much each of the problems Kim dealt with were because she went along with one or more of Jimmy's dumb-fuck ideas. She'd have a perfectly fine career if it wasn't for him. If Kim did have disillusionment with law independent of Jimmy, it was never really discussed. 


For the other semi-well-written characters, there's like a clear, compelling motivation to the character's actions, often tied to some backstory. Why does Gus hate Hector? Because he killed Max. Why does Mike do business with the cartel? He has a family to provide for after his son tragically passed. Even Jimmy, as shitty a character as he is, at least gets a hint of an explanation, as mediocre it might be: he was a sleaze since childhood because his dad was a pushover. 

Why does Kim want to risk her career for Jimmy? Because love. Because Jimmy's fun and exciting and Kim's in love with him and his charming ways. And she won't ever do anything to do defy Jimmy because she loves him so much, even though he consistently refuses to listen to her and puts her career at risk repeatedly. 

Lmao _this is literally the laziest possible way to write a female character_. Reminds me of Sakura and her infatuation with Sasuke in Naruto.

>The way the justifications slowly overtook the original moral positions throughout seasons 4 and 5 is honestly some of the richest character writing I've ever seen

What moral positions did she have in seasons 4 and 5? Oh, so in Season 4 and 5 she occasionally _said_ that Jimmy was a baddie and he should wisen up. She occasionally made mean faces, like at the end of Season 4 when Jimmy admitted that his monologue to the appeal committee was a farce, or when she cried when Jimmy read Chuck's letter to her at home. Oh, but...like...did she ever do anything meaningful as a character beyond crying and making faces to demonstrate her commitment to her principles? No, she didn't. She went along with each of Jimmy's dumb-fuck schemes because love. This was true from seasons 2-5.

Basically, seasons 2-5 she does whatever Jimmy wants while feigning moral outrage and in season 6 she does whatever Jimmy wants without feigning moral outrage. Oh, the character development.  

Lmao it's hilarious how Americans have such terrible taste in television."
Little Lunch,"It's funny because the only people I can imagine liking Jimmy McGill, a lawyer taken straight from a cartoon, are children."
Little Lunch,Haha classic BB/BCS fanboy. Pure gold.
Little Lunch,"yes, we are in that time in which a story of good triumphing over evil is propaganda, and Christian to be more exact, even when the giant, biblically vast majority of western entertainment is not even conservative or pushes Christian values.

 Hell, people who live in the first world really are head over heels in love with moral relativism as if it were a good thing. Shitty society, shitty capitalism, shitty ideals, I guess.

It's not human nature, it's a sign of a decadent society."
Little Lunch,"Breaking Bad wasn't a biblical justice trope. The bad guy _did_ ""win"" in the end. Walter accomplished his goal of providing for his family. But the point is that it was a pyrrhic victory. How is that ""bullshit""? People involved in the drug trade never win clean victories in life. They always pay a price. It's not ""Christian morality""; it's reality, look at Escobar or Guzman. 

BCS doesn't have the slightest hint of moral ambiguity. Jimmy is a sociopath. The big lie the show tries to feed you is that there's any semblance of moral ambiguity in the show whatsoever. There is none. You have a protagonist who's a sociopath. Not only is he a sociopath, but he's also flat, uninteresting, unintelligent, incredibly corny and constantly gets away with things he shouldn't get away with because the plot says so."
Little Lunch,"They can't admit the show they overhyped isn't the greatest thing ever. It's sad really. I think both shows are incredibly formulaic.

The Wire blows this show out of the water."
Little Lunch,Not with Band of Brothers everyone likes it.
Little Lunch,"God I thought I was the only one that thought so.

And people act like ""oh must not be enough action for you poor baby,"" but like... Succession is a fantastic show with zero ""explosions"" that just wipes the floor with this show."
Little Lunch,What if I told you it's not a thriller
Little Lunch,It's literally not trying to be a thriller. It never was. That doesn't make it a bad show. It's a character study more than anything else.
Little Lunch,"If you've seen 4 seasons you should finish it. Season 5 was the best, the closest to BB. Lalo is a great character."
Little Lunch,"""Complex writing"" like, you know, randomly killing off a major character (Howard) with perhaps the cheapest, most inexplicable shock death in television history."
Little Lunch,"I think it got better post-chuck, I didn't care about his annoying character."
Little Lunch,"To be fair although he is definitely a scam artist and sometimes a bit of an arsehole, he definitely struggles with his own morality and honestly does try to be a good person throughout the series and that's part of what makes the show so entertaining to watch. Especially when it comes to how he interacts with the other characters in the show and how he affects them and how they affect him.

If you don't like it, you don't like it, but it might be worth giving it another shot."
Little Lunch,"I couldn't stand Saul, a real life saul would be the worst person you'd ever meet"
Little Lunch,"Except we don't get Soul until much much later. Season 1, 2 and 3 could've been done in 2 seasons of 10 eps each. There's so many unnecessarily long takes that's freaking painful and one has to wonder, why? It really don't serve any meaning to the plot really. It it were well made, it would've taken less time, much less. So, what was it? Lack of ideas. Hey, and eps are 45+ minutes. Can't imagine if they were 60 minutes long.   


Acting's good, but I don't get your reaction. Basically any main character in Succession blows them outta the water, in any season. That's just one show.  


Falling in love with a performer is irrelevant as to how good a show is, objectively.  


What about Mike? Was this show Better Call Mike? At times it felt like that, and also the Mike subplot feels incredibly separated from Jimmy's. It's a character that we all know is not gonna die, so he can mess with cartel all he wants, he's covered. Wow, how predictable.  


Sure, we all wanted to see Marie because wtf not. Awesome character, one of Vince's greatest.   


BCS is fan service at best."
Little Lunch,"So chuck is a cunt to jimmy because hes good and jimmy isnt, and kims mother was a scumbag and she found it hard to rise in the ranks so now shes a cunt too. Absolutely genius storytelling, god if someone doesn't like this show they have to be retarded!"
Little Lunch,"Well, they’re litterally just wrong🤣"
Little Lunch,"Same thing as saying “the office isn’t funny” it’s obvious you don’t understand cringe, surreal reality things.  It’s an opinion, but it’s wrong , this person just had breaking bad nostalgia"
Little Lunch,It's so objectively incorrect that I can only assume this entire post is a troll. That or this dude's IQ is lower than his age.
Little Lunch,Like man Jimmy literally caused his brother's death. Is that not a cost???
Little Lunch,All that but I'd be amazed if Kim doesn't end up in prison or dead by the end of this season. I think she's ultimately the price to be paid for all this.
Little Lunch,"Excellent comeback man, bravo!"
Little Lunch,"My goodness, you killed him."
Little Lunch,"I thought BB fan base was the mot toxic, childish one but nah, BCS fan base takes wins by a huge margin. Wow, man, it can get nasty if you disagree about being the best show ever. Like, it's pure perfection, obviously best of all times and an achievement by humanity. Like how many shows have they watched? I don't get the hype, didn't get it with Breaking Bad and it's sometimes awful plot of a guy that should've been killed by any Cartel by season 2, if it were like the real world."
Little Lunch,Your failure to distinguish between fact and opinion doesn't make your opinions factual.
Little Lunch,Any popular show is overrated if you don't like it
Little Lunch,"If you think this show has terrible writing, I don’t even think I can say anything to you. This has some of the best writing of any show currently on TV.

You literally had to make a throwaway account for this cause you know this is a bad take."
Little Lunch,"I’ll be honest, I don’t think you would understand any of the rebuttals. It would be like Sisyphus pushing a boulder up that hill, based on your very shallow analysis and comprehension skills."
Little Lunch,"It would be a lazy way to write her character if she were ignoring her prior characterization in order to stay with Jimmy.  Instead, the way she treats her relationship with Jimmy is an extension of her character traits.  If you wanna go the direction of ""Why does she give a shit about the relationship in the first place?"" all I can say is that Jimmy is a pretty likeable guy, he's witty and (outside of the few glaring blind spots), pretty empathetic.  She also clearly enjoys the thrill of the scam, from a place of her own egotism, and he's her dealer for that.  There's another level to it where I think Kim pities Jimmy as a victim of Chuck's persecution, being kind of a mirror of how she views herself being unfairly treated by HHM, but on a very basic level, I don't think it requires that much justification to explain why her relationship with Jimmy is something that she wants to preserve and would subsequently take risks for.  But the way she treats the relationship, as something she can always go the extra mile to keep alive, is entirely consistent with how she is portrayed in every situation.  It is a fundamental aspect of her character; equating it with the trope of ""person in love; makes bad decisions because of it; tragedy"" is so incredibly shortsighted.  I'm not gonna touch on your misunderstanding of her internal logic, but if you can understand this elevator pitch for her character I'll go into it:

Kim is an astute and brilliant professional, in love with a deeply flawed man.  The same personality traits which bring her success in her profession make it offensive to her, and facilitate her to try to extend her relationship beyond its natural lifespan.  She is fundamentally hubristic."
Little Lunch,"Psst. 

You don't have to like him to enjoy the show. I hated Walt by the end of BB but I loved the show more than ever."
Little Lunch,A failure of imagination and lack of empathy is not really funny. It’s actually kind of sad.
Cowboy Bebop,"[Another article](https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/01/26/cowboy-bebop-creator-shinichiro-watanabe-says-he-was-only-able-to-stomach-one-scene-of-netflixs-live-action-adaptation/) about this where he also vents about his experience working with Hollywood on The Animatrix.

> “Back on The Animatrix, I first got to work with people in Hollywood,” said the director, reflecting on his short for the animated The Matrix anthology, Kid’s Story. “Working with those kinds of people is always difficult. This is because at the beginning they promised me that I could do whatever I want, but that’s just lip service.”

> “Actually, I had a big altercation with a Hollywood producer on The Animatrix,” Watanabe recounted.

> “He would always come with these stupid requests, just so he could identify his own contribution,” he continued. “As the requests were stupid and made no sense, I rejected all of them. Unfortunately, I couldn’t win in this situation, so I had to concede on some of these things”

> “I learned from this bitter experience though,” the director affirmed. “For subsequent projects, I became smarter at handling people who wanted to interfere. In that, I would send back very small corrections or adjustments just before the deadline. That tended to work.”"
Cowboy Bebop,"Watanabe:

>”For the new Netflix live-action adaptation, they sent me a video to review and check. It started with a scene in a casino, which made it very tough for me to continue. I stopped there and so only saw that opening scene. It was clearly not ‘Cowboy Bebop’ and I realized at that point that if I wasn’t involved, it would not be ‘Cowboy Bebop.'”

>”I felt that maybe I should have done this. Although the value of the original anime is somehow far higher now.”"
Cowboy Bebop,"I get his logic of not just repeating yourself. As a storyteller, you want to do new stuff. He does voice a little desire that he had done the live-action version himself which I think would have been the right move for a remake/adaptation of this very stylized anime."
Cowboy Bebop,Netflix: so you are saying I should also adapt One Piece and My Hero???
Cowboy Bebop,"They got rid of the femme fatale in a noir story, wtf. They turned Valentine’s character into a second Spike."
Cowboy Bebop,"Honestly Bullet Train felt more like it was a Cowboy Bebop side story. 

It had that tone and beat"
Cowboy Bebop,[He already directed a live action Cowboy Bebop](https://youtu.be/wsfkp3TKqIk)
Cowboy Bebop,"“Although the value of the original anime is somehow far higher now.”

I like this attitude, rather than saying that a bad remake or an adaptation “ruins” the source material the way so many do."
Cowboy Bebop,"I have some sympathy for the Netflix Bebop team- it does seem like a good portion of them did care about the show. Some of the set designs were fucking dope. They obviously went to the trouble of getting Yoko Kanno back (more of her music is easily the best part of the show).

But it was a bad idea from the start. Netflix didn't give it the budget it needed. The writing was fucking sloppy. I love John Cho but I maintain he was too old for the part. What the fuck did they do to Julia?

It's just one of those things where it's difficult to replicate lightening in a bottle. Anime Bebop is effortlessly cool. Netflix Bebop was screaming at you 'LOOK HOW FUCKING COOL THIS IS' which is obviously very uncool."
Cowboy Bebop,I think its always hard when you adapt anime into live action. There are ones like this one that just dont work because of its visual style. Very hard to reproduce
Cowboy Bebop,"I didn’t hate it, but it definitely didn’t capture the spirit of the original at all."
Cowboy Bebop,"The original Cowboy Bebop is one of the greatest shows I've ever watched. And it's also a show I have no real desire of watching a live-action adaptation of.  Even if it turned out pretty good I would still be hesitant since the original is such a work of art, which the Netflix show failed to deliver. Of course people are entitled to enjoy the live-action show, but it failed to capture the essence and characters of the anime."
Cowboy Bebop,The show felt like a fan project to adapt all the iconic shots from the anime into live action without a lot of thought for what happened in between.
Cowboy Bebop,">It Was Clearly Not Cowboy Bebop

That's a perfect summary of that reboot."
Cowboy Bebop,"It was just another case of a new set of writers wanting to tell *their* story, wearing the carcass of something already beloved. 

Vicious in particular was just egregious. His power fetish is having his balls shaved by scared sex workers? Really? Someone genuinely thought that added to his character."
Cowboy Bebop,"Choice quote in [here](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2023-01-27/shinichiro-watanabe-spills-the-tea-on-the-live-action-cowboy-bebop-the-animatrix/.194229)
   
> Firstly, Watanabe clarified the amount of involvement he had in Netflix's live-action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop: Practically none. Although Watanabe is officially credited as a consultant, he has not actually watched a single episode of the show from start to finish. ""They sent me a video to review and check. It started with a scene in a casino, which made it very tough for me to continue. I stopped there and so only saw that opening scene. It was clearly not Cowboy Bebop.""
   
If you *ever* hear staff of a live-action adaptation say 'they got approval from the original creator' or something like how they brought x or y in as ""a consultant"", don't believe it.  Unless that person specifically says what they did, like directly, it is all bullshit to pretend like they want to honor the source material to easily duped fans
   
I am looking at you Netfix One Piece"
Cowboy Bebop,"As we’re seeing with the last of us, the original creator needs to be a key part in a remake."
Cowboy Bebop,"Network: You want to make a live-action ______?

Applicant: Yes.

Network: Will you follow the source material?

Applicant: No, see we want to...

Network: GTFO.

How it should be."
Cowboy Bebop,No one cared about Vicious backstory or the character at all whatsoever. The showrunner had his head up his ass and squandered a great opportunity.
Cowboy Bebop,I watched the original anime again instead. Didn’t even bother with the Netflix live action.
Cowboy Bebop,The best thing this live action brought us was the anime itself being avaiable on Netflix and the complete ost on spotify
Cowboy Bebop,One piece fans: *chuckles* I'm in danger
Cowboy Bebop,"What would he expect? It's netflix! They take IPs or potential good ideas and shove algorithms and insane corporate goals inside it until the good stuff just fades away.

Then wash, cancel it within a month, rinse and repeat"
Cowboy Bebop,I like John Cho.
Cowboy Bebop,This is why you don't make live-action anime!!
Cowboy Bebop,"The way they wrote Faye and the entire first episode really was the most painful shit for this die-hard cowboy bebop fan.  I think Choo gets a lot more shit than he deserves - I thought he did pretty damn good.  And the actor who played Jet absolutely nailed it.

There was a LOT wrong with the show.  And I 100% blame the writing and the need for the show to check off the typical ""Netflix check list"" that most of those shows do."
Cowboy Bebop,Good thing we never got to fully see where they were going with Ed.
Cowboy Bebop,>sPiKe! SpOiK SpiIIGeL!!
Cowboy Bebop,TIL theres a live action cowboy bebop
Cowboy Bebop,"You see what the live-action didn’t understand is this, Cowboy Bebop is Jazz… Watanabe loves jazz, and so, Bebop was an ode to Jazz.

The live-action was elevator music."
Cowboy Bebop,"Adaptation doesn’t have to be the exact copy of the original medium. The problem is it’s so devoid of what the actual show and writers and actors start to fight the fans to show that they’re correct. However, fighting with the fans only causes fans not to watch it."
Cowboy Bebop,The trailer looked so damn bad that I couldn't bring myself to watch the first episode. Guess that decision was justified.
Cowboy Bebop,"Certain adaptions don't work. This one was problematic. It wasn't one thing either, it was a little weak in multiple areas, acting, pacing, editing, sets, and choices. 

Take for example ""The Last of Us."" Some scenes and dialogue match very closely, other beats like the spores are not. Now, I'm not a fan of The Last of Us, but I do think the choices they made were deliberate and helped. The story feels broader then a video game cut scene. 

What you have to get is the spirit of the original, in this case the anime had a certain cool factor. Now, when Keanu was attached, I thought it was a bad choice originally too, but then I look at John Wick and there is a style and intent that works. So, Keanu, can be elevate with the proper mix and elevation of other elements. So this casting John Cho as Spike could have been saved if the other elements were better. Although I still think it would have been a stretch."
Cowboy Bebop,Netflix needs to stop stealing shit and ruining it from other creators. They're doing the same thing with a live-action Avatar the Last Airbender and the creators of the original animated series took to reviving the show because I'm sure Netflix will butcher that too
Cowboy Bebop,"It was definitely different. But the only part I really didn't like was Vicious. He was a fearless sociopath in the original show. In the Netflix show, he was so whiny and prone to groveling. 

Like that scene when >!the Van tell him to shoot Julia, the cartoon Vicious would have shot himself instead. Thinking that it probably wasn't loaded and being willing to risk that it was.!<"
Cowboy Bebop,No point in watching Netflix shows that are soon to be cancelled anyways
Cowboy Bebop,I didn’t think it was *that* bad!
Cowboy Bebop,I hate when stuff like this comes out. I'm a big Bebop fan... And I enjoyed the live action one. It makes me feel like I shouldn't enjoy it
Cowboy Bebop,I think we all knew that. It’s very hard to bring the anime genre to life. You really can’t replicate that type of atmosphere and story in flesh and blood.
Cowboy Bebop,"The level of detail in the original anime was artistic on a level all it's own. Everything from the drawing to the world building to the character arcs and especially the music. You can tell the actors wanted the live action to work and to their credit they did a pretty decent job. But everything else fell somewhere between a C to a B and when you're trying to capture the soul of an IP that was A++ it needs to be better than that. Anyways, see you space cowboy."
Cowboy Bebop,This just proves to me Shinichiro is being arrogant here. I hadn't seen the anime and I really enjoyed the live action remake. I then watched the anime afterwards. How many people were exposed to the anime through the live action series? People need to pull their heads out of their asses.
Cowboy Bebop,"It was missing a Keanu. The show could have been anything with the word Cowboy Bebop as the title if Keanu was just idly there in the corner the whole time. Litterally just standing there in the corner not doing anything and looking away from the camera. He probably would just be there smoking a cigarrette with his headphones on. At one point he would call his girlfriend on the phone and break the 4th wall and say, ""hi sweetie, yes, I will be home soon. I just have to finish this cowboy scene. When I come home I will make dinner for us and do all the chores. Ok, love love, kiss, kiss."""
Cowboy Bebop,"I liked it. Wasn’t 100% bebop, but it was close enough"
Cowboy Bebop,Same experience. Fell asleep half way through the first episode in disappointment and never went back.
Cowboy Bebop,People like anime in large part for the animation. Why doesn't Hollywood understand this simple fact?
Cowboy Bebop,A Netflix show was awful and deviated way too much from the source material? Absolutely unheard of!!
Cowboy Bebop,"Oh for fucks sake am I the only one who enjoyed this show for what it was?   
It tried, struggled and at the end failed miserably to be a good adaptation of the original but it was \*fun\* to watch and had something in it that kept me going."
Cowboy Bebop,"Want live action Bebop, just watch Firefly"
Cowboy Bebop,"The writers of these shows don't actually care about these shows.

Like halo, rings of power, Witcher, they don't care for the material, they just want the name to use as a vessel to push whatever ideology they have at the moment."
Cowboy Bebop,"i remember watching Cowboy Bebop around when Firefly was out and loving all the ""space cowboy"" stuff.


I miss firefly."
Cowboy Bebop,"If you want a live action Cowboy Bebop, then just go watch The Expanse…"
Cowboy Bebop,"I watched and enjoyed the Netflix series. Maybe it's not true to the original, but having never seen the original, I had no expectations except seeing MILF guy."
Cowboy Bebop,"Damn, was it as bad as death note?"
Cowboy Bebop,I still haven't watched it. It's never going to match up with the anime so I don't think I'll bother
Cowboy Bebop,Well I enjoyed it.
Cowboy Bebop,"For what its worth I liked the Adaption. I would never even try to create a rl cowboy bebop cause it was just not in a setting that you can recreate at all in rl, but if u just take the Show without comparing it to the original its pretty neat imo"
Cowboy Bebop,It was Guardians of the Galaxy warmed over. And I really love GoTG. The performances for the most part were good.
Cowboy Bebop,One can only hope HBO will pick it up
Cowboy Bebop,I’m one of the few that actually likes it
Cowboy Bebop,It so easily could of been though
Cowboy Bebop,Exactly!
Cowboy Bebop,Same here.
Cowboy Bebop,Same
Cowboy Bebop,"As someone who never watched the anime series, I didn’t mind this show and thought it was “cool” and different. Definitely spent a lot of money on effects. Just makes me think if done right and with the right folks it could have been something great."
Cowboy Bebop,Ok so headline is true but man I really liked the series and wish they would have created another season
Cowboy Bebop,I feel the same about pretty much any live-action remakes of anime
Cowboy Bebop,"I actually liked it, and am a huge fan of the anime… it was like watching a retelling, not an exact shot for shot remake - and I think that’s what I enjoyed about it."
Cowboy Bebop,I still found it an enjoyable sci fi show thou
Cowboy Bebop,"I had only seen a few CB animated when this came out, and I enjoyed the live action more. This is Firefly all over again."
Cowboy Bebop,I thought the Bebop adaptation was better than most anime-to-live-action efforts.
Cowboy Bebop,"Also, the way they portrayed Gren broke my heart. That was my favorite character arc and they kinda ruined it in the live action version"
Cowboy Bebop,I thought the live action show was pretty solid tbh.
Cowboy Bebop,"As someone who never watched the original cartoon/anime, I thought this was pretty cool. How is it different from the original?"
Cowboy Bebop,"Having never watched the animated version, I kinda liked the live action version. Plot took a nose dive on the last episode or two though."
Cowboy Bebop,I love them both soooo much. To each their own but I wanted more of that live action one.
Cowboy Bebop,"I quite enjoyed it. Not as cowboy Bebop but just as a fun, kind of stupid sci fi show. I'm disappointed they didn't do a second season, but I get it."
Cowboy Bebop,"The tragic thing here is that the show was actually not bad, in fact it was pretty good in parts. It just wasn't Cowboy Bebop. There were flashes here and there, but overall it's clear the creators didn't know the material."
Cowboy Bebop,Yea I liked it but I never watched the cartoon…and why did all the true fans roll over and get sick when it started in a casino? I’m completely lost
Cowboy Bebop,Since I never watched the cannon and only ever saw the Netflix series I guess I’m in the minority here cause I liked it and want a second season
Cowboy Bebop,I don't care. I <3 CB and I still got pleasure from the live action remake.
Cowboy Bebop,I thought it was fun.
Cowboy Bebop,"I’m sad that the creator was not involved , as he shoud’ve obviously, but I absolutely loved it. It doesn’t have to be verbatim. It was exciting! Love it for what it is"
Cowboy Bebop,The first scene with Vicious immediately was a turn off. Cold blooded serial killer turned insecure daddies boi is burned into my head.
Cowboy Bebop,I liked it. Not as bebop but it was entertaining for me. I guess I'm the only one. 😑 I can separate source material from adaptations though.
Cowboy Bebop,"""I couldn't watch it but I know it wasn't the same."" says person who didn't watch it."
Cowboy Bebop,Only thing they got right was Jett
Cowboy Bebop,"Am I the only one who enjoyed the show, it wasn't as good as the anime, but I genuinely enjoyed it, and was bummed out when it was canceled"
Cowboy Bebop,Never knew Bepop. Loved the show. I need more SF on Netflix.
Cowboy Bebop,"I would have loved a second season. 

I enjoyed it, warts and all."
Cowboy Bebop,I couldn’t finish half the first episode because of how corny it all seemed.
Cowboy Bebop,"I'm a huge fan of the anime. I still enjoyed the live action Cowboy Bebop.

I liked John Cho as Spike and think he did great with most aspects of the character. I noticed that the ending theme changed in the live action when the episode propelled the main story, it changed to Real Folk Blues on important episodes. The Church scene at the end was overall pretty accurate with the music and tone, so I had some goosebumps. 

I think my love for the anime made me like the action a bit more, instead of just hating it more. I recognize where it falls short, but I had fun watching it. I don't think many people finished the live action to really give an opinion. Most fans of Bebop that didn't like the live action said it was because Ed and she only showed up for 1 minute, in the final minute, of the whole season. I doubt most made it to the end."
Cowboy Bebop,If they are going to do anything with Bebop just do another Animated Movie. Or like Gantz:o.
Cowboy Bebop,"I actually didn't mind the main trio and liked their characterisations (Faye was too gruff, but I liked her actress). What they got incredibly wrong was that they turned it into a sort of referential love letter to anime with super campy comic book-style editing.

Being that Cowboy Bebop in itself is a love letter to *Western cinema and music*, this was the absolute wrong series to approach with an anime mindset. Like yes, the opening is super campy, but it doesn't reflect the action in the show."
Cowboy Bebop,"Instead of creating mediocre adaptations of anime or cartoons, Netflix should fund more adult animations.

Westerners can 100% make good animated shows that appeal to a broad audience, Primal, Invincible, Arcane, Castlevania, Pantheon, The Legend of Vox Machina.  (these are the more recent ones, the list goes on)

The problem with companies like Netflix is that they believe that they believe ""animation is just for kids, adults aren't interested in deep, story driven, cartoons lol""

Netflix thinks that it can treat anime the same way Disney treats marvel comics. Basically, a script they can use.

I'm not too confident about the Netflix ATLA remake, since they fired the OG creators. (it's technically not an anime but it's still a cartoon)"
Cowboy Bebop,I’m not sure anyone could make this show properly. But if someone did.. if someone could actually catch that magic I felt when I first found Cowboy Bebop. I would be forever impressed. I feel this was the best attempt we may ever see and it fell way short. But Jet killed it.
Cowboy Bebop,Vicious was terrible.
Cowboy Bebop,But when's season 2?
Cowboy Bebop,it's crazy to me because I feel like Cowboy Bebop is one anime that should theoretically adapt to Live-Action really well..insane how badly they screwed it up.
Cowboy Bebop,"I'm a huge Cowboy Bebop fan. Haven't watched a second of this. 

I've learned my lesson since ""The Last Airbender""."
Cowboy Bebop,"I went in expecting to hate it and honestly, I really enjoyed it

Aside from the final episode. That was silly.

I've never seen the anime aside from the first couple episodes."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Looking at who he's up against in that category, that seems doubtful.  Brian Cox, Jeremy Strong or Bob Odenkirk are much more likely"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Not over Bob Odenkirk…
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Bob Odenkirk or we riot.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I highly doubt it considering that he is up against Jeremy Strong, Brian Cox and Bob Odenkirk."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Anyone other than bob odenkirk would be a shame. BCS wipes the floor with ozark.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Maybe, but too bad the final season of Ozark fell pretty flat."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Give it to Bob!
Inuyasha: The Final Act,i'm not sure jason bateman did anything extraordinary in the latest season acting wise. i'd say julia garner deserves to win but she's already won twice and this season felt like everyone was a little off.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Bateman? really?
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Sorry but this is Bob Odenkirk’s year.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,You see uhhhh Bateman uhhhh he's working on it. He uhhhh really portrayed Marty Byrde really uhhhh well but Bob will probably win it okay. Good talk
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Varity weirdly misspelled Bob Odenkirk as Jason Bateman and Better Call Sual as Ozark. They need new writers and editors for sure.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,[deleted]
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I really wanted Wendy >!to die, or at least get a comeuppance from Marty. She didn't.!< 

I really wanted Ruth >!to come out ahead or at least back in regular life without ties to all the crime. She didn't.!< 

I really wanted Jonah and Charlotte >!to make it out of this family.  Instead, in 10 minutes, Jonah goes from ""I think I'm going to enjoy normal life"" to killing a man with a shotgun, and Charlotte got no character development at all this season!<"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Him?
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Over Odenkirk? Please say you’re joking
Inuyasha: The Final Act,He's had stronger performances in previous seasons.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Of the nominees this year, Jason Bateman is probably the least deserving of the award. I think everyone else turned in a better performance than him by a wide margin."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Bateman was very good in Ozark, but the best acting performance by a male actor was Hamish Linklater in Midnight Mass, and that dude didn't even get nominated."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Love Bateman but I'm not a big fan of this show. It has some great moments but also a lot of misses and just plain slow and boring most of the time. I feel like every episode includes a scene where they are arguing around a dimly lit dinner table.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I dunno man.. Ozark Is great but he’s just Jason Bateman in everything he does lol
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Jason Bateman has never acted anything past being Jason Bateman.  Solid in the part but nowhere near the complexity that Odenkirk displays as Saul Goodman, especially in this last season.  If Bob loses, shit is rigged (like we didn’t already know they are)."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I don’t know why.

He was in no way the best actor this year although Linney was pretty good."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Jason Bateman always has the same damn expression. Not that great of an actor in my book.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,As much as Jason Bateman has done amazing work on this show - Laura Linney absolutely gave the best performance on this show. Love or hate Wendy she was always compelling to watch onscreen. Hopefully she gets acknowledged this year.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,That’s BS. His acting sucks. Same worn out tired crinkled forehead expression during all the seasons. Kidding me.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Jason Bateman just plays Jason bateman
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I dont BUYYYYYYYYY it


Byyeeeeee"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,As well he should! Incredible season!
Inuyasha: The Final Act,It should have been the dude that played wendys brother.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Ron Howard's voice - ""But of course he didn't"""
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Not deserved if Bob Odenkirk is eligible.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Fuck that. Give it to Odenkirk.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"##”…He didn’t.”

###Arrested Development music plays."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Bateman is good in ozark, but idk if he should win. Part of it is how his character is written, but he doesn’t show a ton of range and is a little robotic. Julia garner is the star of the show and is genuinely one of the best tv performances I’ve ever seen. Bob odenkirk should win."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"When he didn’t win it for Arrested Development, that was a crime already."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I can’t believe he has never gotten an Emmy.  He’s great snd has a ton of work out there.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I hope Bryan cox wins it

The others can fuck off"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Winning over a couple of Roys would be an upset
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"This is a bit off topic, but let's be honest, Severance is probably gonna clean up in most categories except for MAYBE this one"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,nobody should win anything for that final season..
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"He really shouldn't, I don't think his acting was anything to write home about honestly."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I stopped watching this midway through S3. Writing got too cheesy, sanctimonious, and off the rails. Can anyone tell me if it managed to get back on track? Is it worth the time?"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Oh god no. I love Ozark, truly I do. But Batemans acting was a glaring sore spot. Dude has no range at all. Him trying to portray fear is a joke."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Not trying to be mean or anything that I don't think the last season of the Ozarks heart deserves any Emmys. Couple that with the fact that the other choice is in the category are much stronger, I highly doubt this is gonna happen. My prediction is that it will be bob odenkirk."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Uuhh.... yeah.... see.... That's something that could happen.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Nah.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I’m crazy about him. Extract. Bad Words. A bunch of other stuff. I mean, he’s just out there doing solid work and keeping folks like me thoroughly entertained. I really appreciate him even if the award shows don’t."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Even though it’s one of the weaker seasons, that ending is cold even for the Ozark"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Tell me its a marketing post without telling me its a marketing post.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Literally his least deserving season
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Why tf should he? Serious question
Inuyasha: The Final Act,For playing the same character he did in Arrested Development and so many other shows? I have doubts. :)
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"How has he not already, phenomenal"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Seriously? Ozark was good but does Jason Bateman actually act? At most he kind of shrugs
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I don't understand the purpose of this article. He could win it because he is nominated and acts well? Isn't that why anyone could win it?
Inuyasha: The Final Act,giving bateman the emmy over any of the other 5 nominees would be a crime
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Why? Because he is extraordinary in the role! I watch series after series and I can’t find a better series or a better lead or director!!! Why? Because he fucking deserves it!!! So does Julia Garner! She is an incredible actress and no one could play Ruth any where near as well as she does! Wish I could find something that comes close to watch!!!
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Honestly, I love him, but he essentially plays the same character in every role.  He does not deserve it looking at who he's going against.  Bob Odenkirk is masterfully playing two completely different characters right now better than he played his one."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,How has Bob Odenkirk not won yet?
Inuyasha: The Final Act,The show was insane and his role made it so
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Totally think he should get an Oscar for Ozark! Heck of a performance this series will be missed!
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Is the finale good? Just say yes or no. I'm just afraid to be disappointed. Not sure why cuz the show was always really fucking good.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Bateman is due and it’s deserved
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I felt he was overlooked on “Its Your Move”.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,It should be Bob Odenkirk. But it probably won’t be.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Why? Cause he is (and has been) awesome!
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I used to work in advertising and got to work briefly with Jason on some Honda commercials. A true gentleman and one of the nicest, hardest working man I’ve met in the industry"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,“Mhmm. Yeah. Ok.”
Inuyasha: The Final Act,What a fucking let down that final episode was. Totally jumped the shark and ruined its legacy
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Awful ending. Not worth the time invested.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"The crazier this show got, the worse the writing got."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"He ""could"" win an Emmy like I ""could"" win a billion dollars in the lottery. There's a chance, yes, but is it likely? no."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,He should’ve got an Oscar for Teen Wolf Too.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,This final season was a slog. Couldn't wait for it to be over and the ending was unsatisfying.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,He should get the Emmy. He was tremendous.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Entire show was disappointing, this guys never gonna get an acting Emmy 🤣"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Kind of surprising considering how long he's been acting.  He must have at least been nominated though.  Well hope he wins, that'd mean both teen wolfs won an emmy."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"Naw dog, everyone knows the shortcut to a major Hollywood award is for any actor to be the producer or director of a winning film or series…."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Lmao.  He doesn’t even fit in with the show/main theme.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I’m having trouble getting through season 2. I’m guessing it gets a lot better real soon, cause damn… this is yawn material"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Bateman isn't winning it.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"What do you mean “why”?  Anyone who’s seen the show, can understand why without this article.  It’s a master piece.  Linney on the other hand could be replace with any number of different people and her role would be improved"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Jason Bateman is a fucking national treasure.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"I didn’t like the finale but Bateman absolutely deserves an Emmy, so does Laura Linney, tremendous TREMENDOUS job by both of them!"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"TL:DR, good acting"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,About Fncking time. JasonBateman is great. 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Um bc it was fucking awesome
Inuyasha: The Final Act,The first season was easily his best work ever; the last season? I don't see it
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"“Could” 

Well yea so “could” i lemme grab my camera.."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"As he should, he did a tremendous job"
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Probably not.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I wasn't a fan of the finale ending myself.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Only his first? I’m surprised by that
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Should have won for AD
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Goat
Inuyasha: The Final Act,"He should have gotten an Emmy for 'It's Your Move', that was a great show."
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I've watched bits here and there. How his character hasn't just had his wife killed off yet is beyond me. Granted I haven't seen every episode but those I have watched seems like she's not helping any situation at all.
Inuyasha: The Final Act,Didn’t they have to pay people to watch this show?
Inuyasha: The Final Act,I love these campaigns from their media teams disguised as news stories. Odenkirk all the way.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"For those that aren't big readers.

>The drop in Disney+ subscribers — which was bigger than analysts expected — **was entirely driven by a 3.8 million sequential decline Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia**, to stand at 161.8 million at the end of 2022. In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ gained about 200,000 subs (to reach 46.6 million). Hulu gained 800,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.0 million, and ESPN+ increased by 600,000 to 24.9 million.

I'm guessing the deep-discount-for-longer-commitment promotion for that market ran out in Q4."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"tl;dr because of hotstar losing Indian Cricket broadcasting right, Disney is crying"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I’m outside the US and it’s just infinitely better here it seems. Stuff like Sons of Anarchy or Lost are on it. Plenty of stuff that I’m assuming are on Hulu in the US.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I cut mine. No real reason to keep it long term. It’s better to just subscribe every once in a while to binge shows imo. The slow trickle of new Star Wars episodes isn’t enough to keep me subscribed…

Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Combine it with HULU into one platform like they do in the UK - problem solved.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Okay so if the US version is gonna merge with Hulu like everyone seems to predict, can we *please* fix the settings on the kids mode? It locks out so many of the classics on there, and even some of the current hits (looking at you Moana)."

Transformers: Robots in Disguise,That loss was apparently entirely driven by India where they lost the rights to cricket. Otherwise it wasn’t a bad quarter for them.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"somehow, somewhere on reddit somebody is blaming netflix"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"It's probably an overstated headline once you read the article, however Disney's new show development is so bland, risk averse and rides so much on safe Star Wars spins off's that it won't surprise me if this gets worse.

Be more like HBO and splash some money on new, fresh ideas that are different, and stop just churning out vanilla, sterile good v evil, MCU style crap and you might pick uo some viewers."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Somebody should combine all the streaming services and call it ‘cable.’

Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I only have it because it's included in my Verizon subscription.  We use it maybe 3 times a year.  I certainly wouldn't pay for it.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"There are too many streaming services now, it’s easier to just torrent everything."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I presume this will change when Mando comes back

Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Most people are not reading the article and saying their opinion on why it declined. It's the cricket rights, especially IPL."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,everyone finished watching Andor
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"If people ever get bored of SW and MU then Disney+ is going to be in trouble. 

Nothing else they put out is even remotely interesting IMO."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"*Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 13%, to $5.3 billion, while its operating loss increased 78% to $1.05 billion. The higher operating loss — which was better than analysts’ forecast loss of $1.22 billion for the DTC segment — was due to higher content and technology costs at Disney+ (with higher average costs per hour of programming, which included an increased mix of originals) as well as higher content costs and lower ad revenue at Hulu. Financial performance of ESPN+ improved thanks to higher retail pricing. The company continues to expect Disney+ to hit profitability in fiscal year 2024.*

Operating loss was $1.5 billion in the last quarter. They have reduced that by nearly $0.5 billion in just a single quarter and that is before the bulk of the new planned cost cutting measures take full effect in 2023 and 2024.

*At Disney’s linear TV networks, revenue dropped 5% to $7.3 billion, and operating income decreased 16% to $1.3 billion.*

As far as revenue goes DTC is almost matching cable. Long way to go until it matches profits, of course, but these stats tell us why DTC is so important to,the future of Disney. Declines of 5%-16% in linear year on year are just not good numbers. It is why they cannot pull back on DTC."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I cancelled mine until the new Mandalorian season starts. Not paying an increased price for no ads when there isn't anything new airing.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,They raised the subscription price from $6 to $14 AUD a month to renew my subscription!!! No thanks
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Disney owns what will be $79 UFC PPV fights so expect more losses soon. Stand By... All the OG's are retired or have gone elsewhere because of greed. Do better.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I can watch the Simpsons in Japanese, hell a ton of movies in many other languages. Disney Plus is pretty nifty. I doubt the future version of the service will be this good."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"> We believe the work we are doing to reshape our company around creativity, while reducing expenses

Yes I’m sure that will pan out wonderfully lol."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"It’s also worth pointing out that Disney’s introductory price for the service has come to an end, so what used to be $70 for a year of the service is now $130. I’d bail too."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Yeah, they ballooned the cost. What did they expect?"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Would be nice if they created content for the consumers not themselves. Although yes I get the decline is in Asia.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I cancelled mine and signed up with a different account right before the price hike because I pay yearly. I don't know if I will keep it next year, but the kids do watch it. I already gave up on Netflix two years ago. These streaming services forgot why people wanted to ditch cable and are now getting just as crazy price wise."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Remember the day when megalithic companies didn't buy up all the TV rights... And it was free on terrestrial TV. 

Damn you SKY for starting it! Let us not forget SKY was charging £50 at one point for sports!

Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"The fact that I can't watch Disney+ at full HD on my Desktop PC is honestly what's going to make me cancel. Sure I can download the Disney+ app for Windows 10 but it doesn't work because it says Disney+ is ""not available"" in my territory even though that's completely not true. Only way I can watch it in HD is on my phone!?!"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I subscribe to D+ as needed monthly. There’s no need for it to be a constant sub like Netflix, Hulu, hbo etc. 

D+ has shows I want to see but they’re very specific. So I just sub when it comes back out"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,If they simply added a “resume” and “start over” buttons like all the other apps maybe it would be easier to use…..
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Disney+ was always going to be the downfall of disney.. they cant keep up the quality of there movies with the quantity of crap they need to push out to their streaming service.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Lol hopefully the ""every studio trying to run their own streaming service"" bubble is popping and they give up and put their stuff back on Netflix or Hulu. 

I don't know how they are so stupid as to not realize the reason streaming services are worth it is because you have access to everything in one place. Nobody wants to pay for three or more streaming services to access the same content they used to be able to watch on Netflix alone."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Lmao GDTs Pinocchio humiliated Disney. Pixar is over too. Stop motion is where it’s at.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,The new brand name: Disney -
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"As a Canadian , D+ is the only non negotiable. It has by a significant margin the best content of any streaming service available right now. No way I’ll be cancelling any time soon."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I don't know what these streamers expect.  Everyone can't have every damn service all year forever.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Most people subscribe to Disney+ for 1 show and unsub when the new season is over
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"How about have all the content you supposedly own on your own streaming platform?

Example: Disney owns 20th Century Fox.

20th Century Fox produced the sci-fi action classic Aliens (1986).

Aliens is not available on Disney+. Neither are hundreds of other films I want to watch. Disney owns like half of the fucking entertainment industry. Their streaming service should have *everything* on it, and it has jack shit half the time."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Misleading headline, they actually did good (but not good enough)

>The drop in Disney+ subscribers.. **was entirely driven by a 3.8 million sequential decline Disney+ Hotstar**, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia

Nothing to see here. Completely insignificant. These are the worst, lowest cost, hardest to keep subscribers that routinely go in and out. India/SE Asia have a different style of market in lower cost.

> In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ gained about 200,000 subs (to reach 46.6 million). Hulu gained 800,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.0 million, and ESPN+ increased by 600,000 to 24.9 million.

So this is actually far more profitable.  This is actually them doing well."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Whenever I think of Disney these days, I just think of recycled content.  Canceled 2 months because recycled content is all I saw when browsing through what to watch."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Bring back owl house you fuckers
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I'm not surprised, they don't pump out enough consistently interesting content to just keep a subscription active.

I had a Disney plus for 3 months, watched all the good stuff (Andor, a few marvel shows, some nostalgic crap like hocus pocus 2) and dipped. People like to trash on Netflix but IMO, they're is always interesting stuff to watch on it. I just started watching Vinland saga, a randomly amazing anime, a heist show called Lupin and still have like 5 other things on my watch list I haven't gotten around too."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Keep in mind this was AFTER they artificially inflated subscriber numbers by basically forcing Hulu users to subscribe to D+ as part of a new package to keep their Hulu access. 

We’ve seen your upcoming slate, Bob. It’s dogshit. Title after title of race/gender swapped rebooted IP’s without a hint of originality in sight. If you’re going to trade off nostalgia, stop alienating established fans by changing everything. If you want to tell a new story, tell a NEW STORY. Willow wasn’t Willow 40 years ago. There was a time before Star Wars, or even Marvel. The universe isn’t out of new ideas, maybe just hire some writers with actual talent and give people a reason to get excited again. That’s literally the job you fought to get back and are overpaid for."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,MERGE HULU YOU COWARDS
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,They should try and offering something besides children’s cartoons and star wars shows.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,[removed]
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I really hope the “significant transformation” is a reduction in the number of Marvel shows they make a year. I can’t keep up, and dropped everything after the first few series’"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I hope Iger gets shown the door.

The other day I stumbled upon a video that talked about how this major activist investor Nelson Peltz is trying to convince a board of stakeholders to replace Iger with someone else, because it was actually him that created most of the issues Chapek tried to handle during his tenure as CEO.

And that sounds about right considering Iger is the same genius that decided to cancel Twin Peaks back during its original run and allowed the sequels trilogy to be so poorly planned out.

Peltz is calling this effort of his ""restore the magic"" and holy crap if that isn't the correct name for trying to get Disney to prioritize quality again I don't know what is.

I don't know how they managed to do it, but with the exception of No Way Home I lost most of my interest in the MCU too."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"*** No Marvel series on D+ in a few months. 

People leave."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Those dummies. As a Disney + subscriber, I wanted to change to the combo with Hulu. I ended up having to cancel my subscription, then rejoin under a new email to get the deal. Why not just let me add Hulu? ….because that’s what I did anyway."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"It’s because they upped the price 40% during a economically difficult time for people’s budgets. And then for the 30% of people with TVs that have Roku, they wouldn’t let us do the cheaper ad supported model"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Well, maybe they should try to produce some quality content. One good show can’t save it all. Millions of  really bad remakes of Disney classics that were amazing and timeless won’t make the cut."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"You telling me the brilliant writings behind Obi-one, She Hulk and Ms Marvel couldn’t single-handedly save Disney+??"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,The new Disney can burn to the ground. It's just complete garbage. I would prefer to see the IP auctioned off to other entitites to see what new material can be produced.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Wonder if people are going to get massive attention to this as the end of the world for disney + like everyone on R/television did for netflix last year.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"I only keep it because it has Star, which in turn has a lot of my favourite movies. Just rewatched Aliens, what a magnificent thing, bless James Cameron 

the MCU is complete rotten arse since Endgame and Star Wars, lol, Andor aside, of course. Not much value for me"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Maybe spamming nonstop Star Wars and Marvel content isn’t the answer
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Even though my prices went up a bit, I’m on a grandfathered plan with an almost 50% off discount for the whole bundle."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Let me guess, price hikes and laying people off?"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Funny I was just thinking about canceling my sub. Must be some kind of groupthink. 

I mean there's Mando season 3 and one other thing I wanted to watch that I don't remember off the top of my head but after that it's really not worth it"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Most, if not all, of its new stuff is boring. I couldn’t make it through the first episode of Willow. Warwick was the only good thing going. All the new movies are just meh, except Encanto. (Or so my kids think) The Star Wars stuff is just a travesty, a bad cash grab. Most importantly, when are they going to put Condorman on the platform? They will probably reboot it and make it suck."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I canceled mine. Haven’t used it since She Hulk I’ll reup when there are a few more good shows
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Loses, not drops."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Better start replacing all your white characters with black ones. That will save em
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,And they are somehow shocked about this when they lost all the Verizon free trial for 1 year accounts when people said nahhhh I’m not paying for that
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,They haven't released anything live action marvel or star wars in months. If it wasn't in my Hulu and ESPN+ package I'd probably cancel it too.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Time to start cancelling popular shows after 2 seasons...
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"They need to combine Hulu and D+, move the price to $14.99."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I dropped the service and may resume after new Mando season aired
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Just wait till the next season of Mando comes out.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Andor is over.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,79.99/year I’m not complaining. It’s for my kids mostly who watch. When they’re older I’ll think about removing it. Or if they increase my legacy price.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Clickbait.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"They are not wrong. Unfortunately the people they put in charge will preserve the wrong staff. Disney’s entertainment distribution division is massively bloated by bureaucrats and people that can't execute. Disney Corp favored Disney streaming and hulu’s exec and people over the legacy Disney people. They ended up with massively bloated teams. The horror stories of 8:1 ratio of product and program managers to one engineer or person doing the work is legendary at this point. 

All their tech is a poor copy of 5 year old systems. Most of their competitors have the exact and often better tech."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"When my 6 year old turns one the TV himself he’s most likely to go to YouTube, then I tell him to change it to something with a story and he goes to Netflix kids. Somehow Disney can’t grab his attention, just saying."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I switched to Dudesy+
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"There’s no reason to keep baby’s first streaming service unless you have a kid, you like capeshit, or you’re obsessed with Disney stuff."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Disney Plus content by itself just sucks...  The only reason I have it is cause it is bundled with ESPN and Hulu.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Maybe people are leaving because Disney used to be about wholesome family friendly entertainment.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,I will never ever give Disney my money. Piracy is the only way I will even watch a single thing they put out. Same goes for Amazon.
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Get woke, get broke."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,All streaming services are pure trash
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"If maybe, maybe he would have taken animation more seriously, I bet that they wouldn't be in such catastrophic situation...

Please, all CEO of streaming services (ESPECIALLY FOR HBO AND DISNEY), start to understand that animation is for all ages, and that it is a support to convey great stories and great emotions, if you put it in the hands of the ones who are passionate.

(The single exception seems to be Netflix, with it's founding of Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, and other great stuff like Arcane and Edgerunners... They seem to understand that animation is indeed important, but they've done poor choices too, like the incapacity to share and account outside of your house etc... But still, kudos to Netflix for its take on animation)"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Disney streaming is meh
They clinging to marvel and Star Wars stuff only. It’s getting old, formula is repetitive, and starting to be noticed. They changing a few set pieces and hope to use similar scenarios

It worked at first but meh, it’s now feels very similar.

It also doesn’t help that the stories/plot in general don’t do anything. The status quo doesn’t really change, has no impact on the main movies, it just feels like filler content for the sake of content"
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"From the very start, they radically overestimated how 'sticky' their catalogue is to consumers.  Most Disney fans have hard copies of their movies, probably in multiple media formats (Blu-Ray, DVD, VHS), and without a steady stream of good original content (they go months at at time without anything new anyone wants to watch), it's hard to justify the service as a ""keeper.""  And the original content itself is hit-or-miss.  Boba Fett was mostly dogshit, Obi-Wan was a bitterly disappointing mess made by rank amateurs, and the Marvel shows started strong but have been getting progressively more mid as they go."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Losing low value Indian subscribers isn't really a big deal. They were averaging just over $.56.

D+ is non-negotiable for most parents."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"Huh it was just a week ago that someone on here confidentially declared “streaming is very sustainable”. 

No one knows anything about where we’ll be in the next 5 years."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,Disney is for groomers
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,"If you've seen what's on Disney lately (political propaganda), you also would lose interest in what used to be a channel where you watched fun cartoons."
Transformers: Robots in Disguise,i absolutely hate using the disney plus interface. whats the deal with not being able to preview shows like netflix? i'll be cancelling once my free trial runs out

Black Lagoon,"Adventure Time was neat but I don't get why they built up the Lich for 8 seasons only to have entirely new villains in the final season. Horseman's start didn't grab me, I heard it gets a lot better but I'm someone who cares a lot about first impressions. With Castlevania, I sort of lost interest after Dracula died."
Black Lagoon,From what I've seen.
Black Lagoon,"I don’t mind filler that much so long as it has something meaningful to say, which it often does in Monster. FMA’s  humor wasn’t really for me and Death Note would have been on this list if it wasn’t for its last third."
Black Lagoon,"My man!

Black Lagoon is kinda like Bebop but more Tarantino-ish, Geass is kinda like AoT and is better in some ways but worse in others depending who you ask, To Your Eternity is kinda like an extra long compilation of all the sad parts in Pixar movies (if you really boil it down, that is) Avatar: The Last Airbender is kinda like a more serialized version of Star Wars and features, without exaggerating, a dynamic of the best mentor character in all of fiction with the best redemption arc of all time... also a character there is heavily inspired by Spike from Bebop."
Black Lagoon,"The Lich wasn't built up for 8 seasons? Most of the Lich plot was resolved by Season 4 and the Lich was only involved in a few side plots and episodes with Sweetpea.

The show really doesn't have a main villain, it got tons of new threats throughout the whole series.

Also but saying you only care about first impressions you've literally cut yourself off to the Majority of Amazing Animated shows this generation.

Bojack is incredible by later seasons.

Steven Universe, The Amazing World of Gumball both started pretty mediocre, but by Season 3 both these shows became some of the greatest animated shows of all time. SU went from my least favourite CN show in Season 1 to favourite Animated Show of ALL time by the end, the character development and writing is Avatar level IMO.

Adventure Time I would also say got much better overtime, I actually consider the first few seasons weak when looking back. The shows writing and character development got so insanely in depth and mature, its basically a show that ages with the viewer. Season 5 is when the show started to really build on the story, lore and characters and its masterful."
Black Lagoon,"> Horseman's start didn't grab me, I heard it gets a lot better but I'm someone who cares a lot about first impressions.

Bojack is a show that needs to lull you in with the tropes and archetypes of the adult, animated sitcom so that when it subverts them those moments hit harder.

I feel like Bojack is the kind of show you need to at least finish Season 1 for before you decide if it's for you or not."
Black Lagoon,"I wonder.  Our entertainment consumption was largely determined by network (and local station) schedules.  Cartoons, for example, were ONLY on Saturday morning and over my noon.  If you were really desperate there was Davey & Goliath on Sundays, but .... ugh.  Sunday night, of course, was Disney, and as Rick Moranis said, the Disney music gives you a bad feeling because it means school tomorrow.

But we've destroyed the schedule.  Entertainment is on-demand over the Internet, or played off a hard drive on DVR or PC, or quality time with your DS or whatnot.  It's what you want, as much as you want, whenever you want.  So I suspect the association of a fixed time with a certain kind of entertainment may be gone.

Hate to sound like an old fart (although I am, I am), but I think it's their loss."
Black Lagoon,"Kids these days? Watching a really good match of Starcraft 2 on YouTube, I imagine. "
Black Lagoon,"Yeah, I think you're right."
Black Lagoon,"I watch sc2 matches and love them - Silver Leaguer. I guess watching Watching SC2 matches fit the bill, but it brings up another question. TV is pure passive entertainment. We are told through editing what is important. We go along for  a ride. SC2 Casts demand that the viewer know the rules and participate in breaking down the action. Its more demanding than TV. Do you get lost in the gameplay, or are you studying the gameplay for your own matches? "

Black Lagoon,"seinen is pretty much the only genre that has a chance of not getting slaughtered by Western hands, something like Maison Ikkoku or Video Girl Ai, which are two of my favourite manga/anime. Spokon might also work, something like Slam Dunk doesn't feature too many supernatural elements so it could be done. But I sure as hell don't want a Western looking cast in them, which would be extremely ridiculous, and anyway the Japanese made a billion adaptations and only a few are actually good, great even, I can't imagine a westerner getting close to that"

Black Lagoon,Freesia
Black Lagoon,The Climber
Black Lagoon,"One Puuuuuuuuunch!

Edit: …man"
Black Lagoon,Helling could be good. It’s just Dracula fighting  vampire Nazis  in the uk. The story is simple so it would be hard to butcher. No race change issues because it’s mostly Europeans in it. Lots of action present.  Just depower the main character a little and you are good to go.
Black Lagoon,"Death note
I know we had the horrible movie but death note could easily be adapted"
Black Lagoon,"Kids on the Slope. 

No magic system, no power levels, no fanservice, no decades of canon to ruin, no spiky-haired underdogs who kill the spirit of darkness with the power of friendship. 

Just a down-to-earth, human story about three teens in 1960s Japan who bond over a shared love of American jazz music.

Seems like the perfect fit for live action. Plus it's chock full of awesome Yoko Kanno music."
Black Lagoon,"I'd argue that almost anything could theoretically work provided that the anime itself was great in the first place. Some may be more likely to be executed well than others, and some would inevitably look sort of weird in live-action, but that wouldn't on its own make them bad (if anything it might just make them stand out in a unique way)."
Black Lagoon,Spy x Family
Black Lagoon,"Code Geass. If they can do the mechs justice in VFX, that's just a great revolution noir waiting to happen"
Black Lagoon,Ranma.
Black Lagoon,"I like Sci Fi, so that's the genre I would like to see a couple of titles adapted.

The first one is an old one, ""Kurau Phantom Memories"" from the early 2000s. The story is about a young girl that is bodyjacked by an energy Alien that enters her body during an experiment in a particle accelerator. The Alien proceeds to live her life and integrate to humanity and becomes a sort of security contractor/merc. The thing I love the most about that one is the world building as it shows Earth in the 2100s: it shows it not as a Distopia but a clean beautiful future, when a lot of serious problems like inequality, environmental degradation and war have been solved.
The others would be the Sci Fi classics from the 80s and 90s: Armitage III, Bubblegum Crisis, Battle Angel Alita, Dirty Pair and Ghost in the Shell. Those have excellent stories and until recently would be very expensive to adapt IRL, but I suspect recent advances in special effects might make it less so.
How a ""Legend of the Galactc Heroes"" or a ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" would look in live action?
 I would love to find out."
Black Lagoon,Holyland. It's a fairly realistic story about street fighting.
Black Lagoon,Monster is screaming for an HBO adaptation
Black Lagoon,"Ooh Monster would be interesting. Casting might be tough though, it's been quite some time since I saw Monster but doesn't Johan pose as his sister a fair bit?"
Black Lagoon,Netflix is doing a Death Note tv show with Duffer brothers producing last I heard
Black Lagoon,"That would cost way too much money to do. Just think about how much something like transformers costs. 

Plus anime like CG never translates well to live action."
Black Lagoon,"He did, you would probably need to find a pair of androgynous twins to play them"
Black Lagoon,"That's a good way to avoid having to find someone play Ed: Just set the entire series before they meet her. Also, 

> Edward and Ein were the only main characters to have real-life models. The former had her behavior based on the antics of Yoko Kanno as observed by Watanabe when he first met her.[30]

lol"
Black Lagoon,">""We got under the skin of who the live-action characters were going to be,"" he adds. ""I think that the poetic nature of the anime absolutely allowed for us to mine the archetypal nature of the characters and dig out deeper histories that we wanted to explore — and answer some of the questions that the anime leaves you with. I think to just redo the anime will leave an audience hungry for something that they already saw. 

IMO the nature of Cowboy Bebop's storytelling method makes the idea of expanding the canon, and shedding more light on the characters, kinda flawed. 

The entire point of the show is that information about the characters and their backstories is relatively restricted...we learn little things in drips and drabs, to some extent in the same manner as the characters do with each other. 

As the crew discover things about each other, the viewer's investment in them individually, and collectively, expands. This is also achieved through subtext, comparison and interaction - when we look at characters like Gren (who's also meant to be a big part of the Netflix version), the viewer is able to find broader themes that resonate between each of the Bebop cast members. The lack of information is what teaches viewers to look for the subtext. To provide more information simply removes that impulse. 

People get caught up on the aesthetics of Bebop, and I think that's definitely the case here. But the reason it's so resonant is because it does character development in such a unique way. The lack of information, and the fact we need to participate in more active observation in order to grasp character motivation, seems to be more analogous with how we learn people in real life. I think that's what makes it compelling to me at least."
Black Lagoon,"Every time news comes out about this show my expectations get lower and lower.

It doesn't sound like it's going to be Cowboy Bebop in the slightest. It sounds like it's going to be something completely unrelated using the characters names and the title to generate attention.

I can't wrap my head around why Hollywood continues to think they can do better than the original. I mean, it's not like they continue to fail at these ""adaptations.""

.... NOT."
Black Lagoon,"Translation:

We grafted the name and trappings onto some new shit - because we feel we can do it ""better"" - or at least leverage the name for some quick cash.

Fortunately - or unfortunately - this fact was leaked months, if not years ago."
Black Lagoon,"This makes sense. There's no real reason they would copy the episodes that already exist. I know people are already shitting on this, but I'm willing to give it a shot."
Black Lagoon,Like we needed more reasons to be skeptical
Black Lagoon,\*Eyebrow raise\*
Black Lagoon,I am excited for this especially with Kanno returning to score. I like Cho but am still unsure if he is right for Spike. Time will tell
Black Lagoon,I'm rooting for this to be good.
Black Lagoon,I’m going to spare myself the rollercoaster of emotions and just listen to the glorious soundtrack by the one and only Yoko Kanno and talk myself into watching the show on a fun drunken Saturday afternoon.
Black Lagoon,Cant wait for youtubers to rip this show apart thats the only entertainment I will get from this.
Black Lagoon,"Translation, this is going to be fanfic garbage pulled out of some egotistic writers ass.  This was already predicted when it was announced."
Black Lagoon,No thanks
Black Lagoon,"every announcement makes the hype go down another bit.

They are just using the now familiar tactic of slapping a well known name on a product to catch the attention of its fanbase only to then procede to insult said fanbase when they will rightfully complain that the product marketed to them has nothing to do with what they loved in the first place. I mean, if you show most people that picture without context they won't see cowboy bepop, expecially not Faye."
Black Lagoon,This show is doomed
Black Lagoon,There's no way I'm gonna consider this canon. Nice try.
Black Lagoon,I'll pass this isn't what I wanted.
Black Lagoon,"In other words we should lower our expectations cause this is going to be bad cause they felt the need to needlessly change things, and don't want to be given shit about it. So this is their ""out"" so later they can repeat the quote as some get out of jail free card."
Black Lagoon,"An excuse in case it bombs critically? Not original but i understand why to say that based off the initial reaction and well Faye's actress not helping towards the hype. No expectations I'll be honest, I just hope the Akira movie doesn't make the same mistakes."
Black Lagoon,This is going to be a train wreck
Black Lagoon,What I hear from this title is that we’re going to hate it because it’s not what we thought we were getting and instead will get another fucked up live action anime movie
Black Lagoon,So what Watchmen did?
Black Lagoon,We already had a Live Action Cowboy Bebop. It was called Firefly.
Black Lagoon,"So bad casting (hush, Cho stans), bad sets, no Ed, and making up their own canon.

I’m not naturally a cynical guy, but this sounds like it has all the composite elements to be a massive mess."
Black Lagoon,"This movie is for sure going to be a huge let down.

Edit: it’s a series. Even worse. Prolonged misery."
Black Lagoon,They're probably gonna commit way more time to the syndicate plotline and less one-offs.
Black Lagoon,Please don't suck Please don't suck Please don't suck..........
Black Lagoon,Stop hurting us
Black Lagoon,THE FUCK? NO MUSHROOM SAMBA? BOYCOT!!
Black Lagoon,Then just make another show...
Black Lagoon,I have no hope for this movie. We’ve been burned way too many times before.
Black Lagoon,"Good! I’m looking forward to this, I’m a huge fan and I know many would start bashing a remake right away. Can’t wait to see their stories expanded also EXCELLENT choice for Spike 👍"
Black Lagoon,fuck's sake... just call it something else at this point
Black Lagoon,God I this is going to suck and I am going to be disappointed again by Netflix
Black Lagoon,Looks like shit
Black Lagoon,"im surprised at you guys! didnt death note give you hope for an excellent adaption?

&#x200B;

/s for the dense folks."
Black Lagoon,Pass
Black Lagoon,"The anime is it's own thing, and we will always have it. I'm happy they will not simply copy everything. It would not translate well to live action anyway. I just hope the core of the characters are there. That we get to see Spike training on the ship being a tad Bruce Lee like. I want to see a good fight scene set to good jazz. Most of all, I want good acting and interesting stories. I want it to be technically well made. It can be different. If something at the core is still Cowboy Bebop I'm OK. I'm surprised we ever got this in the first place. If it sucks, I'll just ignore it."
Black Lagoon,Hm that’s what they said about the Dark Tower.
Black Lagoon,"I lost faith back when this was announced and the director said the first scene of the live action show is “basically a shot for shot remake of the intro of the anime” and then when he described it he made it clear that it’s actually inspired by the intro of the movie but with virtually every aspect changed besides the “wannabe preacher with a gun” line (big casino heist instead of some guys robbing a convenience store, lasers and a black hole gun instead of janky guns from the 20th century)"
Black Lagoon,Not canon
Black Lagoon,It's gonna suck. Just look at what they did with Death Note.
Black Lagoon,"Its a good series to do that. The anime episodes were mostly unrelated happenings in the lives of the crew anyway. The strength of the series was the characters and vibe, so that's all they really need to recreate."
Black Lagoon,"Oh my Miss Valentine.  What happened to her outfit?  And I’m not saying she needs to have anime proportions but this is so far off it’s offensive, she could wear cutlets at least."
Black Lagoon,Canon makes it sound like this show wasn't a largely episodic adventure
Black Lagoon,So it’s gonna be garbage
Black Lagoon,"No, fuck off. It shouldn’t be canon at all. Netflix has fucked up this shit before. They’ll probably make Faye lesbian or something."
Black Lagoon,"The anime only had 26 episodes anyway.

Still it'd be nice if they did one remake a season.  Just to help ground some of the design changes within the context of the anime's style.  Specifically Mushroom Samba."
Black Lagoon,Christopher Yost is an extremely kind and lovely man. I can’t wait for this. So many amazing people on the production side.
Black Lagoon,"I might of missed this, I thought this was a movie, is it a series?"
Black Lagoon,"Julia and Vicious and Gren and Teddy Bomber and Hakim have been cast, [IMDB cast list](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1267295/fullcredits) [Cast list via Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop_(2021_TV_series)#Cast_and_characters) . Which can only mean one thing; it's gonna be a mash-up of story arcs from the original show a la the tepid garabage dish that was Ghost in the Shell (Live Action). Do not know what the eff I am on about watch this -> [Nerdwriter1 comparison of GitS vs GitS(LA)](https://youtu.be/v2soHxEN79c) .

For a how to do source material justice watch Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade then Illang: The Wolf Brigade."
Black Lagoon,"I wish someone would have the courage to just say its bad, so we can all move on"
Black Lagoon,"So this is basically code for, we took a beloved franchise and changed things around but expect it to be just as beloved despite not giving proper consideration to the original work. See also Netflix Full Metal Alchemist Live action."
Black Lagoon,"The point of this show has to be to attract new audiences who don't watch anime or animation in general which means pandering to fans of the anime will actually hurt it's chances.

It needs to be a reimagining not a remake.

Cowboy Bepop is over 20 years old, us long time fans who still care are a pointless target audience we will hate watch it even if it's terrible just like we do with other live action adaptions so we can bitch on Reddit and YouTube.  

If it's good or great, well great! but it doesn't matter we are too small an audience to matter.

Prediction if we original anime fans love it, it will be Firefly 2 a one and done and if we hate it, it will magically resonate with general audiences and last 4 damn seasons."
Black Lagoon,Still not watching it.
Black Lagoon,Spike is Asian? Kind of “forced diversity” ngl
Vis a vis,"The show is good, but the inaccuracy of portraying Zulema and the Egyptian is killing it for me, as an Egyptian. First off, their accents are both off, they’re not even speaking any real Arabic accent, they just sound like foreigners trying to imitate an Arab. There are also other things like how when Leopoldo is looking for clues online, all the sources he comes across have Arabic letters that are separated, not actual words, which is exactly the way Arabic writing ISN’T. 

It’s just sad because they spent so much on the show to make it good, but then anyone who is from the Middle East could have told them in a split second how to fix those things to make it realistic."
Vis a vis,It’s great. I desperately want to watch Season 4 but it’s not being shown in Australia as far as I can tell.
Vis a vis,"I love this show, it's such a wild ride, reminds me of prison break."
Vis a vis,Outstanding.
Vis a vis,"Just finished season 2 last night. I watched season 2 on Prime, but it just recently came to Netflix within the past week or so. Prime had different subtitles, so you're probably in for a better experience on Netflix. 

Anybody know how to watch season 3?"
Vis a vis,"Season 1 and 2 are legit awesome, but seasons 3 and 4 go on a completely different direction than what was set up in the end of season 2 and are simply not has good. It is still worth watching, but it is a significant step down from the first two seasons."
Vis a vis,"This show was so good, and it helped me to learn more Spanish a little bit. If I didn’t catch all of the captions, I would go back 10 seconds and re-read again. It wasn’t hard to follow along. I found myself thinking about these characters during the day, it’s weird how it stuck with me so much, when it’s only a character. I didn’t want the last episode to come. Maybe there is another season? I don’t know. But these girls spent years together, as enemies and friends. The picture of the whole group together was sad, it was as if it was “better times”. But not necessarily, it was just a different time, and things change over time that we can’t control. So that gets me sad, but they all pulled through. With some exceptions of course and some surprises! (I think my first post on Reddit ever!)"
Vis a vis,"I just finished the whole show. The ending is amazing. I won’t say any spoilers at all, but the way they wrapped up everyone’s character arcs was absolutely incredible. My main gripes throughout the show were plot holes on little things (mostly details that aren’t that significant but bothered me internally) and the lack of consequence for certain actions (also kind of insignificant in the grand scheme of things). I really enjoyed seasons 3 and 4 even though they seemed a bit more fan-service ish because of how impractical it would be to have so many members of the cast coincidentally at certain places at the same time. 3 and 4 also move at a faster pace than 1 and 2 (partially good and bad). Other than that it ends up closing bombastically and has me hype for the spin off show they’re making, but don’t look it up cuz it’ll spoil the show with its premise. Overall I give it an 8/10"
Vis a vis,"I binged watched the whole seasons . First two seasons were a hit, but then the show took a totally different direction, like 180 degrees as the main characters got sent to another prison. But still, they had its moments. Zulema is such a badass. I feel sorry though for the poor accent, they coulda just hired an egyptian actor to play Hamadi like they did for his uncle ! I don't know why they overlooked that detail."
Vis a vis,"Chill dude, is a show."
Vis a vis,How did you watch season 3?
Vis a vis,Watch it online through streaming websites
Vis a vis,"You probably already know this by now, but just in case: season 3 is available now on netflix. Season 4 is also coming to netflix by the end of septembre."
Vis a vis,[deleted]
Vis a vis,"As an arab, he is right. Guy is supposed to speak egyptian but its more moroccan arabic lol. A lot of inacurracies."
Vis a vis,Via streaming service called Foxtel. But it wasn’t available until many months after it was released.
Vis a vis,Which ones? My point is it is not streaming on any service I can find in Australia.
Vis a vis,"Yeah I found 3 after hours of searching. 4 was somehow way easier to find. I might rewatch once 4 comes to Netflix cause it’ll probably he a higher quality experience. 

Man what a good show."
Vis a vis,"If they didn't kick start new plot threads it could very well work as an open-ended conclusion. The following seasons will still entertain you, but prepare yourself for a lot of shark jumping and changes that you can tell are happening because something went wrong BTS."
Vis a vis,"you have to realize that the main demographic of the show are not going to be arabic speakers, so they can and will not spend so much emphasis on getting it accurate-they will just go for close or whatever passes- and yea it sucks for realism but at the same time- it's a show.  you kinda have to just go with it unfortunately, accept it like as if they couldn't have the budget to afford the a real accurate gun and just had to fill in a plastic water pistol to film with.  it'll pass for what they're trying to sell but close watchers will of course notice!!  but it doesn't matter. they're not going to make exception just to appease a small target"
Vis a vis,"Not in australia,I live turkey in here streaming pirated content is a big dea. there are great websites that have tons of tv shows and movies but it’s illegal content I can’t suggest a legal streaming website"
Vis a vis,Netflix (us at least) has seasons 1-3 with 4 coming out Wednesday.
Vis a vis,"I wonder waht you thought about season 3 and 4. I loved the first two seasons, but I thought 3 and 4 were very rushed and messy. Many plot seeds that were introduced by the end of the second season were either dropped or mishandled. You could clearly see the cancelation by antena 3 and then the revival by Fox España interfered with BTS logistics and schedules."
Vis a vis,"Lol. Small target ? the show is spanish, have you been to Spain ? do you know how many arabs live in spain ? Do you know where spain is or its history? 

Plus those arab characters are not secondary, theyre the main ones. They should have put more effort in that or just changed the plot from Egyptian to Moroccan for more consistency."
Vis a vis,Unfortunately none of it is on Australian Netflix
Vis a vis,"YES! 100%. When I started the first few minutes of 3 I was super sad and kinda pissed. Almost like a whole new show which kinda made sense, I’m not sure on what happened but I think it got cancelled? And then revived? What’s strange though it seems Netflix is marketing it as a Netflix series. 

I would say seasons 1 and 2 were the best two seasons of any show ever aired in any language, right up with La Casa and Breaking Bad. Season 3 and 4 I still really did enjoy watching and did like a lot more than your average show but yeah it wasn’t quite the same."
Vis a vis,wouldnt a vpn work for you? correct me if im wrong.
Vis a vis,"Yes, the show was cancelled at their original network (Antena 3) and then picked up by Fox España for the subsequent seasons. I don't know what was the exact cause for the abrupt change you noticed in the very first moments of season 3; but I know that the huge absence of that very important character was caused over scheduling conflicts with another show the actress got signed on before Fox España decided to revive the show.

I am looking forward to see how the spin off show works out (""Vis a vis: El Osasis""). But I have a feeling it won't be that great. Not if it the final moments of season 4 are an accurate representation of where the spin off is going to be about (those final moments with those two characters were really, reaaally cheesy).

And glad to know you are also a BB and La Casa fan!"
Vis a vis,"No you’re right but it’s about finding one that works. Netflix has put a lot of pressure on VPNs and a number of them don’t allow Netflix US to be accessed, because of threats from Netflix - remember Aus govt can and do block certain websites and force all ISPs to block them to."
Vis a vis,[removed]
Vis a vis,"Hanbal’s Egyptian accent, Akame and co.’s Chinese accent and Altagracia’s central Mexican accent would be easy (holler if you need any help - I’m Mexican and love Vis a Vis). It would be quite difficult, however, to convey the beauty and sweetness of Saray’s strong gypsy accent in a different language."
Vis a vis,"I love the show. I don't speak Spanish at all and I despise movies with subtitles. But I can't stop watching this. I just started season 2. The show has even encouraged me to learn Spanish. I've only been taking online courses so far. So if anyone has any advice,  I'm open to it."
Vis a vis,I guess Italian is fine for Sandoval 👍🏻
Vis a vis,I'd probably give her an [Irish traveller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Travellers) accent.
Vis a vis,And forget Nosferatu... he’s now La Barbie! XD
Vis a vis,"Excellent! As I said, I believe it’s nearly impossible to translate the tenderness of the way in which Saray speaks. But I don’t think anyone can find a more beautiful thing that could nearly serve as an equivalent as this. Amazing. Your work is awesome."
Vis a vis,"Not sure how they compare as I haven't watched Vis a Vis, but if you like shows of this nature check out the Australian series Wentworth. "
Vis a vis,[deleted]
Vis a vis,"Vis a vis has been cancelled, it will be only 3rd season "
Vis a vis,"A trailer with English subtitles for the ""Vis a vis"" series: https://vimeo.com/123821140
Just found out season 2 is the last one (to end on June 22nd).
Available for streaming in UK (Channel4)"
Vis a vis,"Came to comments to recommend Wentworth. Better than OITNB, imo "
Vis a vis,"Thank you to both. Indeed Wentworth looks more similar in tone to ""Vis a vis"", while OITNB is described as a comedy-drama."
Vis a vis,"Maybe it's an American thing.

I have not heard of any of these TV shows, except maybe 'Criminal Minds', which I have never watched. Aussie here."
Vis a vis,NCIS probably belongs on there. It's consistently been in the top 10 television shows for about 20 years and has spawned numerous spin-offs... and it's almost completely absent in the cultural conversation.
Vis a vis,"I greatly enjoyed your findings, I get a real kick out of this stuff. I wonder which animated show wears this crown? Chowder maybe?"
Vis a vis,"I don't know how popular they were in the States but growing up in Australia, Becker and Everybody Loves Raymond were some of my favourite shows (and I still have lots of fond memories of both today). I assume they'd be popular since they both got lots of seasons, but Becker gets lost in Ted Danson's storied resumé while Raymond looks like it's become mostly a punchline if it comes up at all."
Vis a vis,"Maybe Ally McBeal? Huge at the time, completely forgotten now. Started the careers of Calista Flockhart, Lucy Liu, Portia Rossi and Jane Krakowski and was Robert Downey Jr.'s first attempt at a comeback before Iron-Man (cut short by his coke habit at the time). It also arguably started David E. Kelley's successful string of TV law series with quirky characters (the last of which was Boston Legal).

I'm not even sure if people watching it now even get that the Futurama episode about the ""Single Female Lawyer"" TV Show is a complete parody of Ally McBeal."
Vis a vis,"How could you possibly say Big Bang Theory didn't have an impact on the cultural zeitgeist? As much as people hate it, it super-normalized  geek culture in a time when superhero movies were about to become the biggest thing in pop culture. Bazinga alone is huge. The show also normalized science as a career option and it can't be overstated for prominently featuring a proud Indian character in the main cast. Raj has to be the most prominent Indian character in American television since Apu and he's actually a main character and played by an Indian actor unlike Apu. I can't imagine any 21st century sitcom is more culturally relevant than BBT outside of The Office."
Vis a vis,"Any Chuck Lorre produced show, like Dharma an Greg or Two and a Half Men, could count. They were popular shows at the time, but they really didn’t add anything new to the television experience. What makes a show memorable is that it’s new, different, and shapes our television watching experience. A show like Seinfeld, for instance, was the first of its kind that impacted many shows after it (the sarcasm, self centered-ness, the focus on single people instead of family oriented). For a show like Seinfeld, you can name a dozen shows that came after it that were influenced in some way. A show like Two Broke Girls, is just a bunch of easy jokes thrown together. Funny now, but in 20 years it won’t be remembered."
Vis a vis,"I would hardly call *House Calls*, *The Naked Truth*, and *Veronica's Closet* contenders for any sort of cultural zeitgeist. They had bigger ratings solely because of the sitcom giants they followed, not because they were necessarily good or popular in their own right. If you followed a sitcom giant *Friends* or *Cheers* or *MASH* or *Murphy Brown*, you were gonna be popular, quality be damned. The fact the latter two couldn't survive on a lesser night shows their popularity was artificial. None of three had enough episodes for regular off-network syndication.

I'd sort of put the latter-half of *Alice*'s run (post-Flo) in the same category. It survived because it filled scheduling holes for CBS and could retain a sizable audience. It was an easy/comfort-viewing sitcom. The show was playing regularly on several local TV stations well into the '90s. *Empty Nest* (aka *The Show with the Dog* if you were around at the time) was similar. It filled NBC's Saturday scheduling hole and was a pretty non-demanding sitcom that like *Alice*, ran out of creative steam fairly early, but the casting helped keep the show together enough.

If not for Brett Butler's spiraling, *Grace Under Fire* would've been a much better remembered show. The first three seasons are excellent TV and gave us a great spin on the family sitcom with a non-nuclear family that wasn't afraid to tackle current issues. Without experiencing the show or only as a memory, it is difficult to separate what the show was vs. what it became in the tabloids. But the show has cycled through hundreds of times on Laff in the past 5 years."
Vis a vis,"Just to throw out another choice:

**Home Improvement**

8 seasons, all ranked in the top 10

* 1991 #4
* 1992 #3
* 1993 #2
* 1994 #3
* 1995 #7
* 1996 #9
* 1997 #10
* 1998 #10

204 episodes, including the series finale that according to Wikipedia was ""the ninth overall series finale ever presented on a single network in television history, watched by 35.5 percent of the households sampled in America.""

12 People's Choice Awards, 8 Kid's Choice Awards, 9 Golden Globe nominations, and 7 Emmy nominations.

A huge star in Tim Allen. Major guest stars. Breakout young stars like Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Pam Anderson. It even had a video game! And when was the last time anyone ever mentioned Home Improvement? Can you name one quote from the show? The only thing most people can probably remember was that you never saw the neighbor's face.

Patricia Richardson only had one series afterwards was mostly off of TV for the last decade. Richard Karn went on to host Family Feud for a few seasons and do infomercials. The only time the kids show up on tv is to guest star on other Tim Allen sitcoms. It has bounced around in reruns from TBS to Nick at Nite to TVLand and Hallmark Channel. It now airs on something called Laff TV."
Vis a vis,"Reminds me of [this article](https://pudding.cool/2020/07/song-decay/):

>Song knowledge erodes with each passing year. This is why I shouldn’t be shocked that my Gen Z colleague has never heard “The Sign,” or that teens are filming themselves listening to “Bohemian Rhapsody” for the first time. This is a normal part of the aging process for music.

>If you take any present-day hit that’s culturally pervasive, such as “Old Town Road” or “Despacito,” we’d expect that someone born today, in 2020, will probably not recognize it twenty years from now. In short, there’s a good chance they’ll interpret your karaoking of Lizzo, Drake, or the Jonas Brothers in 2040 as an obscure act."
Vis a vis,"As a kid of the 80s and 90s I can confirm Simon and Simon was syndicated on local TV all the damn time, but once the 90s rolled around it basically fell off the map like you suggested. 

However whenever Gerald McRaney would appear in *anything* my dad and I would say ""hey, it's Simon and Simon!"""
Vis a vis,"I mean, all we are really talking about is uncool shows. Shows our grandparents watch. My grandmother talks about Blue bloods and big bang theory all the time. The reason these shows do not have the same cultural impact is because 90 year old women don't influence culture."
Vis a vis,"According to my mom, I loved “Simon and Simon” as a young child. I recall reruns being shown in the late ‘90s for a brief period but I haven’t seen it much on television otherwise. 

I think “Trapper John, MD” would have benefited from Wayne Rogers reprising his role and the series being closer to the television depiction of “MASH” in which Trapper had two daughters instead of a cocky son. Since he was on another series mentioned in this thread, he obviously wasn’t available.

“The Naked Truth” was great during its run but once it moved over to NBC it was basically competing with 10-15 other sitcoms and wasn’t very distinguishable."
Vis a vis,"Oh man, I used to love Grace Under Fire. It's a real shame about Brett Butler. It's nice to see her working again on The Morning Show, at least--small part but she's good in it."
Vis a vis,"My mom will watch *Blue Bloods* and *Criminal Minds* a lot on one of those channels that shows reruns. I've heard of Veronica's Closet and Grace Under Fire, but I don't know what they are about. Never heard of the rest of them.

An American Police Procedural might be the best job to have as an actor. They get great ratings, generally, and they'll stay on the air for at least a decade. But they don't get huge numbers in a 18-40 (or is 30?) demo so the trade website and mainstream news don't really cover them. So that means you can make a great living but not get chased down the street by the paparazzi. Chris O'Donnell has been on *NCIS: LA* for 11 years and he makes about $8M a year, if not more at this point."
Vis a vis,"Falcon Crest maybe? According to your modus operandi, it ended up running 9 seasons, 3 of them in the top 10 and one in the top 20. It was also heavily syndicated, I remember my Grandmother watching it a lot. But utterly forgotten, as it was basically a even lamer version of Dallas and Denver Clan."
Vis a vis,"The problem with this is that you are conflating critical discussion, discussion among 20 year old males, current events discussion, and popular zeitgeist.  Not to say you are wrong, but you are combining many things.

The Office was never popular.  It just got a lot of attention from critics and is a darling of the 20ish males that post a lot on the internet.  So it gets a lot of talk about it.

TBBT was vastly more popular than The Office.  But it was not a critical favorite and is hated by the 20ish males that post a lot on the internet (who bizarrely claim The IT Crowd is great but that TBBT makes nerds look bad).

There are very few shows that are remembered much 20 years later.  MASH remains an amazing show.  Whereas All in the Family is remembered for historic reasons, not because it remains popular.  No one talks about St. Elsewhere now except the ending.  Even Friends is barely talked about, although it remains hugely popular in re-runs.

You really need to define cultural zeitgeist in one coherent way, rather than picking and choosing for each show you like what it means."
Vis a vis,You keep referencing “good ratings” for modern shows but those ratings would absolutely cancel them in the days before the internet was popular.  Lea Thompson was on a TV show called Caroline in the City that was cancelled in the 1990s with ratings only beat by the likes of the Big Bang Theory.
Vis a vis,"Kiss my grits! Alice was important in that it was an early show focused on a single mother who was working class. 

I would guess that most people over 50 who watched TV would remember Barney Miller fondly. It was probably the only show of its time that showed the mundane and quirky side of being a cop. I know cops who have said that it was the most realistic cop show at least of its time."
Vis a vis,"Supernatural lasted for 15 seasons, from 2005 to 2020, which is just an astonishing run for a TV show. It must have done well in the ratings to last that long. It's in reruns on TNT for hours and hours during the day. And yet, I never met anyone who watched it until two or three years ago.  And I'm a nerd, and have a plenty of nerdy friends that watch sci-fi and fantasy TV.

Maybe because it's fanbase skews female means guys like me are less aware of it? I also remember reading one of the two leads was considered for a MCU role (Captain America, I think). If that happened it might have raised the show's profile.

If you went out on the street and asked people if they knew who Mulder and Scully were, they'd probably know. Sam and Dean Winchester? I'm not so sure."
Vis a vis,You don’t think criminal minds had any impact on the rise in popularity of true crime/ serial killers?
Vis a vis,Bazinga!
Vis a vis,"I really liked Veronica’s Closet.

It was as good as Just Shoot Me. 

I never heard anyone say anything about Caroline in the City or Mad About You, they were just sort of, there."
Vis a vis,"Im not sure I agree that Criminal Minds is less re-known than Bones, LA Law, and NCIS.

I'd also add to the list...

Step by Step - not sure how popular this was ratings wise, but it was on tgif forever, but no one ever talks about it now.

Who's the boss - Probably my favorite 80s/90s sitcom but you can't even get anything past s1 on DVD.

Designing Women 

Coach"
Vis a vis,"A Different World definitely had a huge cultural impact in the black community. I was in high school - college during the time it aired. Fashion in the black community was influenced by this show more than any other show that was on at the time.

Lot of kids went to college because seeing this show demistified college for them. Lots of kids chose to go to historically black colleges because of this show. 

Its been on in reruns pretty steadily since it ended usually on the black cable channels though and I'm pretty sure it's on Amazon prime now, it was there a few months ago.

It may not have had influence in the mainstream culture but for its intended audience it definitely had lasting influence. Many of my friends kids have seen the show because there aren't that many shows that are about black young adult life. 

People still talk about it on black forums and subreddits."

Vis a vis,"No, they’re just shows that prove the OP’s point exactly. I’m an American and a genuine lover of television and television history. I haven’t heard of most of these shows either. Some of them I wasn’t alive when they were airing which doesn’t help but others just never really went beyond their audiences as the OP said."
Vis a vis,Same for the European that I am. First hearing about these.
Vis a vis,"None of these shows are very well known nowadays apart from Criminal Minds, they're mostly old shows that have fallen into obscurity (or maybe they were always obscure). But I think that's kind of the point, lots of people watched them but no one's ever heard of them"
Vis a vis,"As an Aussie, same here, I've only heard of some of these also.

However I did go through a Criminal Minds binge one summer many years back. I was deeply immersed in the commercial psychology of it, but ultimately it's an *extremely* formulaic show that is completely forgettable. I can see what you mean about popular without an actual impact."
Vis a vis,"No, I’m an American and I haven’t heard of most of these, but I suspect a lot of them aired before I was born (‘95). *Alice*, I’ve heard of— it aired on reruns for a time and I had a theatre professor who guested on the show. *Empty Nest*, too, because I’m a big *Golden Girls* fan and the characters from that show appeared on GG several times— although I’ve never seen an episode of *Empty Nest*."
Vis a vis,Yup definitely american perspective! Would love to learn more about Australia. I read in a sunburned country and loved it but that's pretty much my extent
Vis a vis,"UK here, not heard of many of these either.

Also anecdotally nobody knows Seinfeld over here, in the same way that I doubt shows like Phoenix Nights or the Royale Family are known in the USA. Friends however is massive."
Vis a vis,It must be cause I haven't heard of any of them either
Vis a vis,I'm American and I've never heard of most of them.
Vis a vis,I was thinking this was a list of foreign shows. I havent heard of 5 of them.
Vis a vis,"It’s like American Idol. I couldn’t tel you the name of any show winner in the last ten years, but it’s still a cultural juggernaut as far as reality TV and 2000s TV is concerned."
Vis a vis,Right. I really really debated ncis. But it's so under the radar that I've seen it spoofed a few times for being so under the radar. If that makes sense
Vis a vis,"I've seen at least youtube vids poking fun of the ""hacking"" in NCIS. But its up there. It has a lot of fans in my country, but no one knows why."
Vis a vis,"I really debated it. I've seen family guy spoof it a few times. It's one of those CBS shows of the last twenty years. Good ratings, lots of old people and kind of spoofable because it's so under the radar. Like so under the radar that it's in the radar if that makes sense"
Vis a vis,"Oh this is true! I’ve never seen an episode of it, but my friends in 7th and 8th grade were really big fans of it. They also loved *Monk* and played a lot of Runescape. And weirdly, *Twilight*. I’m gay but they were all heterosexual. Never got that..."
Vis a vis,I don't know the popularity of animated TV per se. Simpsons and family guy for sure. But is there an animated show that was popular but then never really had a cultural impact?
Vis a vis,"What about *The Nanny* in Australia? I’ve noticed a lot of Aussies seem to like it. It was never a huge show in the US, but I think lately it’s picked up a lot of steam with kids like me who grew up watching it in reruns.

As for the two shows you mentioned— I’m not sure I’ve ever watched an episode of *Everybody Loves Raymond* but it’s a pretty famous show over here and it’s been successful in syndication. I don’t think I’ve ever heard of *Becker*."
Vis a vis,Culturally I think Becker was popular but got lost in the shuffle of people disucsiing it or being huge becker fans. To me everybody loves raymond pretty much everyone knew.so I think it's impact culturally was correlated about right
Vis a vis,I think it's an example of a show that didn't age well but it definitely was a part of the late 90s zeitgeist.
Vis a vis,Oh that's a good one. Totally agree.
Vis a vis,Ally McBeal had a huge cultural impact in its time. I’d even argue that it helped pave the way for Boston Legal.
Vis a vis,"Ally McBeal had even a copycat porn movie, so it had some cultural appeal."
Vis a vis,"Yeah there was some point in it’s prime where BBT shirts were everywhere. 10 year old me has 3 of them. And the show aired on 3 different channels. Hell, two and a half men has had less of an impact but huge popularity then BBT, and that show was on for years."
Vis a vis,"Sorry. I do think it did have a culturally impact like you say. I don't count it as one of these on my list. Family guy was making fun of it which got me to think of the actual list. I do however think that it had an impact but that it's impact didn't line up necessarily with it's ratings. I.e it was consistently huge ratings but never made the impact of say a Seinfeld. It's funny you mention it because I'm rewatching it now and I think the writers struggled with the same things and started to use catchphrases to get it to be more memorable. They almost turned Sheldon into basically Urkel at end of season 2. Sheldon doesn't mention the word ""bazinga"" until end of season 2. And doesn't mention "" the roomate agreement"" until start of season 3. Both tropes that became part of its cultural zeitgeist lexicon. Again great show, some impact for sure and I wouldn't count it as one of my shows for this list. Was just pointing out how my thinking got started. I would however say that maybe it's impact culturally was less than it's always high ratings would indicate."
Vis a vis,"It didn't normalize geek culture or science, it mocked them and continued to promote the mad science/savant stereotypes that are the bane of both cultures. 

I know of no one in science or industry who looked at BBT and thought, ""hey that looks cool, I'll do that!"" because it's an entirely unrealistic portrayal of functional human beings. 

But yes, to folks outside science and geekdom it seems like it ""normalized"" things."
Vis a vis,I feel like Silicon Valley had/will have a bigger cultural impact.
Vis a vis,">Two and a Half Men

With you on Dharma and Greg. 

I think Two and a Half Men was a distinct show and I remember it being talked a lot even. When Charlie Sheen left, that was as big as of a TV turmoil as that the last season of GOT sucked. But, I think that show was very popular for all the wrong reasons. I watched it a lot but now I think of it as a very cynical and obnoxious show."
Jane the Virgin,"Just like in a telenovela, no?"
Jane the Virgin,"Seems like she kinda disappeared for a while. I really liked her in Annihilation.

I'm not familiar with the podcast but the premise sounds interesting."
Jane the Virgin,"> 'Last Known Position' charts the fallout of a brand new state-of-the-art American commercial jetliner vanishing on its maiden voyage over the Pacific. The ensuing air crash investigation discovers evidence of a creature of the deep that may have been responsible.


The plot sounds dumb, a creature of the deep manages to crash a jetliner?"
Jane the Virgin,"So, they're remaking [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(1999_TV_series))?!"
Jane the Virgin,"I like Manifest and Lost so this might be worth a watch, even if the premise sounds kinda dumb, as long as they make it seem like it makes sense I'll watch it lol"
Jane the Virgin,"This kind of sounds like my thing. I might check out the podcast first, but I'll give it a look."
Jane the Virgin,Missionary
Jane the Virgin,She's done a lot of voice work over the last couple years. She voiced Carmen Sandiego in the Netflix shows and is even playing a live action version in a Netflix movie.
Jane the Virgin,"I don’t know how much impact it had on her career, but she shared a video of herself rapping and she said the n word in it. She apologized but she’s been canceled by a bunch of people on Twitter for having what they consider a bad/insincere apology. She also made some statements about wanting a Latino superhero after Black Panther came out and people canceled her for that too for diverting attention from black people."
Jane the Virgin,"Have you not seen other creatures of the deep, like Godzilla, or the Cloverfield monster, or the giant radioactive octopus from ""It Came From Beneath The Sea""?"
Jane the Virgin,Underwater animals can jump out of the water you know.
Jane the Virgin,The podcast version was pretty good.
Jane the Virgin,"An sea monster big enough to knock over a plane from the sky has to be big enough to be seen from space lol, I hadn’t thought about that."
Jane the Virgin,"The synopsis sounds like something produced by Asylum.

> The drama series focused on the six survivors of a crashed airline flight in the Brazilian Amazon jungle. The group soon comes into contact with a hostile indigenous tribe, the Fierce Ones. They are taken in by a mysterious tribe called the Chosen, who are descended from 16th century British colonists who were lost in the rainforest. Relations with the Chosen are tenuous at best. Most of the group escapes the Chosen only to stir up a hornets' nest with the cannibalistic Jaguar People, led by an insane Canadian woman bent on domination of all the local tribes.


Will check it out, once I find it"
Jane the Virgin,Clearly not canceled.
Jane the Virgin,There’s no such thing as cancelling
Jane the Virgin,"The plot description, at least on paper, sounds ridiculous. 

As for Godzilla, it destroyed fighter jets flying on low altitude. Commercial jetliners, on the other hand, fly on much higher altitude of 35,000 feet.

It’s possible that in the show, the plane loses its cabin pressure, forcing the pilot to descend to 10,000 feet or even lower, which may enable “the creature of the deep” to hit the plane. Guess we will found out once the show is out."
Jane the Virgin,All the people complaining about this clearly haven't seen Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus.
Jane the Virgin,Is it the QCODE one?
Jane the Virgin,The 1999 series felt like it was the lowest-budget syndicated action drama that I ever saw.
Jane the Virgin,There definitely is. Look what happened with what the NFL did to Colin Kaepernick and what the country music industry did to the Dixie Chicks.
Jane the Virgin,Yes. Gina Rodriguez was in that one too I believe.
Jane the Virgin,They were blacklisted.
Jane the Virgin,Supernatural is the most indestructible show on television.
Jane the Virgin,"My grandpa fought in WW2. He told me a story once about how the very first thing he did when he got back from Germany was kiss my grandma, then they curled up on the couch and watched the series premiere of Supernatural."
Jane the Virgin,"I like how Rachel Bloom announced it on her Twitter just now: ""BEHOLD ME, FOR I AM IMMORTAL AND WILL NEVER DIE""."
Jane the Virgin,So...we going to get that finale of Vampire Dairies with the final scene being a black Chevrolet Impala driving into town?
Jane the Virgin,13 seasons of Sopernatural.   That's an amazing feat.   
Jane the Virgin,"Crazy Ex Girlfriend will likely be the lowest rated show on broadcast tv for at least 3 straight years now.

Please never let it die"
Jane the Virgin,And the city of Vancouver breathes a collective sigh of relief.
Jane the Virgin,Season 27 of supernatural? 
Jane the Virgin,Jane the Virgin is an amazing show and I'm so happy it's being renewed! 
Jane the Virgin,"Congrats to Rachel Bloom on the Crazy Ex-Girlfriend renewal. Between this and the Golden Globes later today (possible win?), she's having one heck of a Sunday!"
Jane the Virgin,Carry on my Wayward Son. They'll be peace when are do... well shit don't think that is ever gonna happen!
Jane the Virgin,"At three seasons, maybe people will finally catch up to streaming Crazy Ex Girlfriend and it'll become more than a cult hit. It's really fucking good guys. Not sure what the storyline for season 3 will be but those writers know how to keep it open even if they weren't sure it was going to be renewed"
Jane the Virgin,"Please don't cancel iZombie, please don't cancel iZombie.

Please."
Jane the Virgin,"As a fan of The Flash, Supernatural, Arrow and LOT this is a very good news. "
Jane the Virgin,"So happy! I love The Flash, have been enjoying Supergirl this season, and am a big fan of the DCTV crossovers, so I'm very happy that they all got renewed.

Crazy-ex-Girlfriend is something I have to try watching, I've only ever heard great things about it."
Jane the Virgin,"Yay more Supernatural,  been watching for over a decade now and still enjoying it. "
Jane the Virgin,Yay - more supernatural!
Jane the Virgin,"Sweet jesus, Supernatural will never die will it?"
Jane the Virgin,"Really really surprised they're renewing CEG this early but I'll take it! 

Also, has anyone actually been watching this season of Arrow? Is it any better than last year?"
Jane the Virgin,What about iZombie?
Jane the Virgin,"*Supernatural* with it's Thirteen Season (2017-2018) will bring that show to 285 episodes.

Didn't they say last year that it might end at 300 episodes? So I guess that confirms a short final Fourteenth Season of 15 episodes for 2019.

Does that officially make it the longest running prime-time scripted American series?"
Jane the Virgin,The creators of Crazy Ex Girlfriend always said they wanted the show to have just four seasons. I think The CW is going to give it to them at this point - all for the award potential. There's really no other reason why it would be renewed for a second time otherwise.
Jane the Virgin,"Great for Supergirl, but I miss Cat. I understand that Calista didn't want to move to Canada, but she was my favorite character. 

I read that she'll still pop in from time to time, but it's not the same dynamic between Cat and Kara that I loved in season 1."
Jane the Virgin,"Yeah, more Superhero crossovers! I am loving the DCTVerse way more than the DCMovieverse. It is simply so much more fun. I also like how the writers of the shows went from, okay, we aren't going to do this, this and this and we are going to kill this, this and this character so it doesn't conflict with the movies to Oh, the movies suck, all the stuff we weren't going to do, it's back on and let's see if we can bring back those characters we killed. Everything is back on the menu, people! 

Also, Supernatural is never going to end. I laughed when they said they were going to bring in Rick Springfield as Lucifer this season but, Jesus, he made Lucifer terrifying. Not snarky fun like Pellegrino's  but really scary. Who knew? "
Jane the Virgin,Fuck does this mean they aren't renewing izombie? Or would that be announced during or after season 3??
Jane the Virgin,I have a lot of faith in Supernatural when it comes to a satisfying ending at this point.
Jane the Virgin,"I love Legends. It doesn't get a lot of love, but I'd watch an entire series of Purcell and Miller as Heatwave/Captain Cold. "
Jane the Virgin,"Excited about Constantine being back albeit animated. How can I easily view this series (not having cable). Would like to check out along with Vixen's show.

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions :) I was hoping it would be on Netflix with other CW shows, but as long as I don't have to subscribe or sacrifice my first born I'll check out the CW seed site."
Jane the Virgin,Crowley still knocking about in Supernatural? Was my favourite character (til I gave up during season 10) Mark Sheppard deserves a lot of plaudits for that character.
Jane the Virgin,"Legends is the funnest show on TV. People complain about technical shit, but I just turn my brain off and have a blast watching it. "
Jane the Virgin,Please let iZombie and the100 do well.  I don't want those to get cancelled 
Jane the Virgin,Sucks for anyone developing a new show for the CW. 
Jane the Virgin,Okay should I watch Supernatural? It seems like I am missing out on something.
Jane the Virgin,"Legends kind of sucks but in an endearingly goofy way. Glad Flash is continuing although it is inconsistent in quality, it is always fun. I don't watch Arrow unless it's a crossover  ep. "
Jane the Virgin,Here's to hoping they renew The 100.
Jane the Virgin,Hooray for CEG and Supergirl Season 3's
Jane the Virgin,"CW is the Oprah Winfrey of cable channels.    
""You get a renewal! You get a renewal! Everyone gets a renewal!"""
Jane the Virgin,Carry on my wayward son.
Jane the Virgin,"Took me 6 months to catch up to supernatural, would recommend 10/10."
Jane the Virgin,More supernatural fan fic seasons! 
Jane the Virgin,Wow I can't believe I have been watching supernatural since high school... I graduated in 2003...
Jane the Virgin,"Supernatural still going strong.

I need to pick it back up."
Jane the Virgin,God damn it I was pulling so hard for No Tomorrow. It is so damn charming and just all around upbeat in a way that isn't cheesy. 
Jane the Virgin,"I watch the 1st 4 so good to hear them getting renewed.  Been thinking about getting back into ""Supernatural"" as I stopped watching in the middle of the 11th season."
Jane the Virgin,You get a renewal. You get a renewal. You all get renewals!
Jane the Virgin,60 seasons and a movie!
Jane the Virgin,"If anyone needs to know why Supernatural is still going simply watch one episode... 'The French Mistake'.

Edited a word."
Jane the Virgin,Damn shame about Frequency. I loved the movie and the show is really good too. Great acting and it feels more like watching a long movie than a TV Show. Shows like that unfortunately don't last long while paint by numbers procedurals go on forever. 
Jane the Virgin,We are also getting an animated Constantine series on CW Seed!
Jane the Virgin,"As much as I enjoy how the show just simply continues to live on (like the Winchesters), I feel like it would be appropriate for Supernatural - a show that's filled to the brim with supernatural lore - to just end on its 13th season, y'know? "
Jane the Virgin,To the people that watch Grimm and Supernatural how would compare the two? I never watch Supernatural and super bummed out NBC canceled Grimm.
Jane the Virgin,Glad to hear about Legends of Tomorrow.  I honestly enjoy that show more than Arrow and Flash anymore.
Jane the Virgin,"I was in seventh grade when Supernatural started. I'm now a college graduate, and have a project '67 Impala with my dad.

And the show is still airing. Damn."
Jane the Virgin,Is ... is Jane still a virgin?
Jane the Virgin,Screw it let the kids from super natural get paid.. they will never break type casting. Although the character who played Sam did a couple c level horror movies. I just wish they did not bury and piss on it like some kind of of weird super natural ritual.
Jane the Virgin,"I remember flipping through a magazine that had Supernatural as a show to watch out for before it debuted. I remember thinking ""It looks really interesting, too bad it'll probably get cancelled like all cool shows."" I can't believe here we are a decade plus later lol."
Jane the Virgin,You can't lock up the darkness
Jane the Virgin,Supernatural!!!
Jane the Virgin,Soooo any chance that supernatural will cross over with the flarrow-verse?
Jane the Virgin,What about daredevil?
Jane the Virgin,"Knew Arrow was going again, they talked about how they will handle the flashbacks for season six last year."
Jane the Virgin,Hooray for Supernatural 
Jane the Virgin,"I love Supernatural, but I'd like to see it end on it's own terms, instead of being renewed until it's cancelled.  "
Jane the Virgin,Yes. Give me more dc shows.
Jane the Virgin,Oh snap more supernatural!? I thiught they were done lol how many dieties is there left to do really? 
Jane the Virgin,okay i know season 4 airs february but i NEED the 100 renewed
Jane the Virgin,What about iZombie? 
Jane the Virgin,The CW has a suprisingly good lineup of shows. Can't wait for iZombie season 3
Jane the Virgin,I'm shocked they renewed CeG. Very happy
Jane the Virgin,"I never thought I'd say this, but I hope the SPN writers have a plan for a final season. It's been a really fun ride for a really long time, and it'd be a shame if it didn't get a proper send-off, which at this point would basically be a whole-season finale. "
Jane the Virgin,Supernatural back again!
Jane the Virgin,Any hope for iZombie? 
Jane the Virgin,"holy shit. They're still making more Supernatural? I remember back in like, season 2 or 3 they managed to stop the apocalypse (after accidentally starting it by trying to stop it). How do you keep going after that? Isn't everything else going to be kind of disappointing? "
Jane the Virgin,Any proud watchers of The Flash Season 2 here?
Jane the Virgin,"YES! More Melissa Benoit, more Winchesters. Here's hoping *The 100* gets another renewal after its next season."
Jane the Virgin,Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is such a great show. Bringing music back to scripted television.
Jane the Virgin,"In today's TV landscape riddled with shows being canceled after one or two ""low-rated"" seasons (or even a few low-rated episodes), it's been absolutely refreshing to see CW take a stand these last few years and stick in there with the shows it believes in, regardless of ratings."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,If it is anything like All Hail King Juilien in quality I am down. 
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Ah, converting CGI to flash. Shorter, cheaper, and more jokes to put it."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Well, I mean, if they can replicate the bizarre humor of the original show, I'll totally be down.  But since the movie was just a generic DreamWorks ""kind of funny but also remarkably bland"" movie, I'm not holding high hopes.  I want a show that has no issues spending an entire 8 minutes episode just setting up one incredibly terrible pun.  That strange Rocky and Bullwinkle humor that I can't define, but definitely know when I see it."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Hopefully it'll be better than the movie.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Are any of the Dreamworks shows for Netflix any good?
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Its like BBC returning Danger Mouse!
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[godammit dreamworks! why can't you just know when to stop ?](https://youtu.be/Mi8za2kTJDs)
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Yeah man, I can't wait for the episode where Peabody gets the entire Roman Empire hooked on ~~crack~~ coffee."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Since when has Dreamworks been bland? If anything I have always found them trying to hard to be bizarre. 
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,never happen the guy is old
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"A kids show for sure and not heavy on plot, but very funny. Lots of adult humor and some of it being surprisingly crude (In a good way). Some clever references too, Futurama, 50 Shades of Gray, and Jurassic Park come to mind. I think it is worth the watch if you have kids or are a fan of animation. "
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Not near as good as Gravity Falls (probably my favorite TV show in general), but it a silly for adults and kids thing. "
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I love that Craig is super serious here and asking real questions. He really tried super hard to give him well reasoned questions and still keeping his own style. Just excellent
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Craig Ferguson was the entire reason to watch Late Night TV
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I love that he respected Craig enough to even show up in the [intro of his final show](https://youtu.be/tggLZnB3Wn0?t=93).
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"His monologue that night was really good too. He tells an anecdote about how the City of Glasgow clowned on the apartheid government by renaming the street the South African embassy was on after Nelson Mandela, so all official mail to or from there would have to have his name on it."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Thank you for the post, OP. He was a great man. With a great laugh, too"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"The Late Late Show would win a Peabody Award for this interview.

ftfy, Peabody Awards go to every member of the show"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Do we have a picture of Paul McCartney?
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Craig later claimed Tutu was the most impressive person he ever interviewed
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Craigy ferg was the best.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Archbishop Desmond Tutu doing his Nelson Mandela impression is something else.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Now he’s Late Late Late
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,A great man Archbishop Desmond. May he rest in peace. And a fantastic interview.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,His Giggle ❤️
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I will miss Archbishop Tutu and I’ve been missing Craig Ferguson for a long time. Super nice video to watch tonight.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,So... Why did they replace Craig with a boozy panda? Why????
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Man I miss this fucking show
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Been thinking about this all day. Was happy to see someone post about it. Thanks.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Desmond TuTu is the greatest man ever imo. A true idol.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Two beautiful souls. America is lucky to have an immigrant like Craig 💕
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I actually just watched this about a week ago. He barely got started and it was over. Too short. I'm a student of the genre and Ferguson is the GOAT. The fact they replaced him with the WOAT is a travesty I've still not quite gotten over.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"As an Atheist I can say, what a beautiful human being."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Gonna check this later just commenting as a reminder
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Aika tutun näkönen äijä.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Does this go into his racism and homophobia I wonder?
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"For anyone that believes Astrology influences personality, I'd like to put it out there that Yo-Yo Ma, Bishop Tutu, Vladamir Putin and Heinrich Himmler all share the same birthday."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[removed]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Just finished the whole interview. 

Imagine your producers signaling ""ad break, ad breakkk"" in 2009-era network television, and having Desmond-friggin-Tutu in the middle of saying things about how America is healing, and just being like... _how_ in the world do I interrupt one of the most beautiful speeches that'll ever be given on my show?"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Craig Ferguson could have been the most watched late night talk show host, but he decided to be the best."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,You can also tell slightly from his body language he's a little nervous in the lead up to bringing him out.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"I love that he actually broke out AA sayings, which is where his thinking of resentments comes from. Even the word “resentment.” It’s where the poison saying comes from and why he says he didn’t come up with it.

I think it’s important because he’s having an extremely honest conversation and it shows. His “what?!” at women getting water being raped sounded legitimately genuine and out of place in the interview because it was real. 

People don’t get into AA “mantra” unironically, they’re normally being extremely serious, since whatever is a serious issue. The laugh when Father Tutu mentioned quarreling with his wife is something I’ve heard a thousand times in the rooms. He knows how serious things are and he addresses it with levity (like most addicts) but never loses or actually takes away from the seriousness of the topic. 

Wish he was still around, we need more recovered addicts in major roles (not entertainers/clowns)."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"yup, and Craig was doing the interview on the fly, no script or prepared questions like all other late night hosts always have.. or heck, many interviewers have on hand"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I legit feel blessed that I was able to watch Craig when he was on late night TV. Absolute GOAT.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,The only one besides maybe Conan I would watch
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,The only show host who could compete with Graham Norton. Conan is the next great and I like Colbert but Norton followed by Craig are the top
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"true, he was the goat"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"I only heard about him as his show was ending, but I remember him being great on Red Dwarf."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Similar to what Iran did to the UK embassy.

It's on Bobby Sands Street in Tehran"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Was?  I think he still is.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Even Secretariat?!
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[this one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/craigferguson/comments/1evx7d/do_we_have_a_picture_of_paul_mccartney/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Who was the guy who was both fat and skinny at the same time? I can’t remember.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"South Africa has a strong lingering association with communism because the communist party there fought against apartheid. If you listen to their (national SA gov't) major political speeches and such, they use a lot more communist language even when pursuing capitalist policies."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Its also worth mentioning too that he opposed communism and the goal of SA communists to violently overthrow the regime which ties into this belief of nonviolence and reconciliation.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Also he was a supporter of Palestine and spoke out against the Israeli occupation, pointing out its apartheid nature."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,We should all be communists!  It does so well.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Which is insane since capitalism is solely responsible for all the good we have. 

So he was a great man, with one really, really dumb opinion?"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"> Now he’s Late Late Late

Don’t delete this xx"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Delete this. You will never accomplish in a thousand lifetimes what this man did in one.

Go out and help one person. Do one good thing with your life.

Listen to Desmond Tutu and learn how to be a great person."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,His laugh is very heartwarming. Filled with glee
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I understand that reference!
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I'm approaching 50 and he's always been in the headlines since I was first conscious of headlines. And what struck me is that he was always smiling. What joy he brought to the world along with his hard work for justice. He'll be missed.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"I'm atheist as well and there are plenty of wonderful people of faith out there who work for justice. 

It's just that the most prominent Americans religious people tend to be evangelical nutjobs who profit of their faith and use it as a cudgel to oppose progress and equality"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,That is an interview with Archbishop Desmond Tutu on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Something else people might not know is the interviewer’s name is actually Craig Ferguson.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[removed]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Hey look, everyone! The man from opposite land!"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"I've only heard a little of Steve-O's podcast but it seems to fill that ""recovered addict being serious but funny"" niche pretty well."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I mean he probably did prepare for the interview. But he most definitely had no help from his studio. And it wasn't scripted either.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"He is too smart to be dumb enough to not prepare for a guest of this caliber. He and his staff 100% did copious research and preparation for this interview and scripted questions and follow up questions by the dozens, his talent as a host is making it look like he's doing this on the fly. When an interviewer doesn't prepare for their subject, it quickly becomes painfully obvious and the result is usually an embarrassment."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"I never wanted to stay up late enough on work nights to catch him live, (because this is live, right Geoff?), so I’d always catch the previous night’s show on my lunch break the next day. Can’t imagine doing that with any other late night show"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Yeah, me too. I feel blessed to have seen Craig. He ruined me for all live chat shows."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,My dad used to just casually drop in about that time he saw Craig Ferguson and Peter Capaldi's punk band. Some people had weird careers but few more so than Bing Hitler
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Blessed be YouTube and TheJayLenoFly channel
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,that last year was a bit surreal tbh
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I was lucky enough to go see one of his episode tapings. It was amazing to see live.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"If we're talking about original late night Conan on NBC then I agree. If we're talking about any of his incarnations the past 15 years (outside of burr interviews) then absolutely not. 

The reason why Ferguson is a clear tier ahead is his ability to simply talk akin to old school shows like Carson with close to zero agenda (ie he rips up questions beforehand and just freeforms). It was the exact opposite of Fallon. And he could talk just as easily with the smartest (Stephen fry) or the uncharismatic. There was no comedic gimmicks ala Conan's self depreciation which gets old. Just creativity and pure wit."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Graham, Ferguson, & O’Brien are the best modern talk show hosts and to me, it’s not even close"
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"You've never seen Parkinson. He's in the pantheon for sure. And what little I've seen of Dick Cavett was wonderful, too."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Sorry you had to find out this way :/
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"He was a great man. Still is, but he was, too."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,He ded.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,WHO'S THAT AT THE DOOR?!
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Even the robot skeleton!
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,This is consistent across the continent. Much of the anticolonialist struggle was also anticapitalist. Sadly most of these leaders have betrayed their people and their principles. They are traitors.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,That’s not even a little true. He was a proud Socialist.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,I applaud how brazen this bait is
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Does that include capitalistic concepts like public services, (child) labor protection laws, and environmental protection? Oh wait, that was and is all opposed by capitalism."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,"Agreed. Capitalism solved war, poverty, hate, and gave us the Kardashians."
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,You know what Dezzie also had? A better sense of humour than you.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,[deleted]
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,The irony of telling someone to be a better person while also being condescending and judgemental. Practice what you preach.
The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,Are we expected to read the *whole* title before leaving comments??
iZombie,I don't know. The whole show is wild. It became like watching a fever dream. An energy drink CEO threatening the survival of the world leading to an occupied zombie city? Weird stuff.
iZombie,"Currently watching season 5 with my wife, we have both really enjoyed it, it is definintely all over the place but we are both liking it a lot.|  


Idk if I would call it a flop."
iZombie,The Rob Thomas joke was hilarious
iZombie,"I mean it was on for 5 seasons, I think they did fine."
iZombie,What is this subreddit anymore? If I  post about my specific opinion about ABC Family’s Greek am I going to end up on the front page?
iZombie,"I enjoyed the show because I basically binged it. Fun show, was the plot strange? Yeah. 
But I love Ravi and Blaine enough to keep watching the whacky plots.
Also I was under the impression it was supposed to be a parody of a police drama; something along the lines of parks and recreation or the office, and I will admit I probably would have not enjoyed the show as much If I had known it was sort of meant to be a serious show 🤷🏻‍♂️
Even still, I’d recommend it to all of my friends who aren’t obsessed with the rotten tomatoes scores of what they watch. Just saying."
iZombie,"All I can say is, Rose McIver. *mic drop*"
iZombie,"""Flopped""

I don't think that means what you think it means."
iZombie,Yes but Rahul
iZombie,Bad opinion
iZombie,Ok
iZombie,"The show was overall very fun, some storylines weren't great but overall my wife and I enjoyed it greatly.

Hardly a flop."
iZombie,"I think it went downhills as time went on but that’s all CW shows lol, but idk if it’s as bad as you describes 

Also it is kinda funny that the military guy is LITERALLY named major lol"
iZombie,No it didn't. It was awesome for the majority of the show. Shit take.
iZombie,"It's interesting to read the graphic novel then watch the show to see what directions it could've (wereterrior anyone?) gone.

I liked the different scenarios the show tossed out and it was pretty fun to watch."
iZombie,Counterpoint...it ended too soon and we need more of that fucking banger of a show.
iZombie,I liked the show and I think you cared more about the show in yer rant than the writers did through the whole thing.
iZombie,I enjoyed this show a lot more than I thought I would so it gets a solid rating from me
iZombie,">In S1 the series was a solid 6/10.

&#x200B;

Sounds like you ~~did~~ thought S1 was a flop as well."
iZombie,"To be fair, the whole point of the show is that it really *isn't* her fault. That's the entire source of the drama. Unfortunately, you can only take that premise so far before it gets stupid."
iZombie,I enjoyed watching the series and I've watched it 3 times. I do not like how the show ended but I truly enjoyed the characters even when the storyline was a little off.
iZombie,The hookup brain was the fucking worst. The ending of the show felt forced as well.
iZombie,I loved this show.  I don’t know if it was original to this show/comic but the idea of ingested brains imparting strong personality traits was awesome.  It allowed for the actors to really show a wide variety of skill in their roles.  The cast had a great chemistry together which I always enjoy.
iZombie,I don’t think you know what flop means.. the show ran for four more seasons so it didn’t flop. If you didn’t enjoy it that’s one thing but it’s not like it got cancelled a season or two later.
iZombie,"The first few seasons are so good & funny, when it’s just solving crimes using brains and keeping the secret.

Once they started to try and create more macro plotlines with Seattle discovering zombies are real I kinda hated it. I feel like Rob Thomas was trying to take it an unconventional/unexpected direction but it became depressing!!!!! Not at all the tone I wanted from it, it’s a ridiculous premise, let it stay fun and ridiculous without real life practicalities. 

I also didn’t like Liv/Major or Ravi/Peyton and wish they had better romantic subplots throughout the show (and all of Liv’s bfs kept dying like how depressing). Ravi/Liv would’ve been more interesting as a slow burn over the course of the show, they had more chemistry.

But the first 2-3 seasons are great tv"
iZombie,I liked everything except for when it got all military ish
iZombie,"Your username says you are a guy. If so, then perhaps you missed the central part of that show, that it was primarily for females (as is most things on that network). All the plot points you mentioned are just being a female-centric show. Nothing wrong with that. Same thing happened with Buffy (remember how Spike was a fan favorite, so they had Buffy fall in love with him, even though it was against her character, etc). Well, Blaine was a fan favorite, for some reason, so they threw the Payton story line in there for the female audience. Same with Liv have sex with different guys. In male-centric shows, it goes the other way."
iZombie,"You just reminded me im pretty sure I haven't seen the last season yet...

Definitely will add to watch list"
iZombie,[deleted]
iZombie,"why watch a show, then go complain to the internet about how you don't like it? Just stop watching the show then. Clearly it's not for you."
iZombie,The Dirty Dancing scene is one of my favorite things ever
iZombie,The last season was kinda weak. But everything else was fine. In fact more than fine… it was fun. It was a fun show to watch.
iZombie,"... is this what people mean when they use the term ""incel?""   
Because holy F this dude sounds like an incel."
iZombie,"What are you talking about cheated on him 4 times??? She cheated once, with Chase Graves. She was only dating Justine for like a week before it happened…. Christ sake. Chill"
iZombie,"I managed to make it through the first season and a half, but only because I thought the actress was so adorable.  But eventually, even that wasn't enough to hold my interest."
iZombie," To be honest liv was simply too girl boss for major, who can blame her."
iZombie,"Whatever the bad guy. Blaine maybe? He was the worst. He was an idiot who only ever employed idiots. And somehow off-screen he's this criminal genius? Things just work out for him cuz he's ""such an amazing criminal"" and on-screen he's only ever shown being stupid, messing things up, and only ever hiring the dumbest people who cannot perform the simplest of actions without messing it up because they have the intelligence and impulse-control of children.

His character and his entire organization was stupid and pointless and irritating and the plot forced him into relevance with dumb off-screen stuff."
iZombie,It’s a show…
iZombie,"My main/primary issue with the show is that in addition to the storyline beats, the actress for the main role was essentially the ""copy my homework but don't make it obvious"" casting of Kristen Bell so the entire show just felt like a re-skinned Veronica Mars. 

Basically, been there, done that."
iZombie,I enjoyed it. I also liked new blood so I'm odd
iZombie,"Turning a police procedural into a militaristic post-apocalypse story is so daring that you will not catch me saying one bad word about the team behind that show on any occasion. They have my respect forever now. As far as I'm concerned, they pulled that off pretty well too, all things considered, so I thoroughly enjoy it"
iZombie,I thought her adopting the traits of the brains she ate became way too caricatured. All the other zombies didn’t act as idiotic when they ate brains.
iZombie,"I enjoyed the show overall. The only thing I disliked is how in early seasons Liv would take on a few things from the brain she was eating. In later seasons she’d full on dress and talk and act and 100% be the person she ate. It increased too much as the show went on, so that in later seasons she was so over the top acting as someone else. No consistency throughout the show."
iZombie,Flopped implies it was cancelled
iZombie,My issue was that it seemed to copy Buffy in so many ways. But I guess that goes with the genre
iZombie,"Yeah OP is oddly judgy of a show that was throwing shit at the wall and that’s half its entertainment. Its premise starts with “what if Veronica Mars was a zombie detective and our writing staff was on cocaine. Also in Seattle”

This is like getting mad at The 100 because the show’s plot didn’t make any sense and they blew up their own premise every season, usually by literally blowing it up. Like….duh that’s half the reason I stuck with it binging with my spouse. Shit went wild."
iZombie,I liked the different characters Liv got to play each week.  I imagine that must be a dream job for an actor to completely switch up who you're going to be in each episode.
iZombie,The comics it's based on are wild as hell too
iZombie,This is the plot of the 2014 video game *Sunset Overdrive* and I can’t tell if this is a reference or just an identical plot setup.
iZombie,I'm with you.
iZombie,I also enjoyed it. I need to take the time to read the comics and see how different they are story and character wise.
iZombie,"It's 90% ""hot take"" shit posting now. Just downvote."
iZombie,Wait but what is your specific opinion about Greek?
iZombie,The show has like a 95% rotten tomato score bro. Lol
iZombie,"Counterpoint:
Rose McIver AND Aly Michalka AND Rahul Kohli"
iZombie,The pancake flipped from police investigation drama to straight up soap opera. Hard flop.
iZombie,"Hear hear, I second this motion!"
iZombie,My god I love that man
iZombie,Ok then. I've cited my obvious evidence. Defend you point. Dont just say 'No'
iZombie,"the main character is literally name ""liv moore"" aka live more... 

major is secondary to that lol."
iZombie,If you prefer soap operas to actual crime shows and three sex scenes per episode than sure.
iZombie,"Comics.

They were comics. 28 of 'em, to be exact.

And they were goddamned good. Anything Mike Allred touches is usually gold."
iZombie,Def some missed opportunities from the comics but you had to know early on the show was going in an almost completely different direction early on with its Quantum Leap story formatting.
iZombie,"It definitely needed more season 2. The post flu-vaccine Seattle stuff was less interesting, in my opinion."
iZombie,Why the hell is a 7/10 rating seen as middle tier? It should be 5. 6/10 means slightly better than average.
iZombie,"But it is her fault though. She is completely aware that the personality she has isn't her own and she can use that to do awful shit. Her being aware is enough to prevent it, but she has absolutely zero willpower."
iZombie,Ravi and Blaine hard carry.
iZombie,Tbh the series seemed to copy buffy too many times
iZombie,I'm not sure how women would enjoy watching the main character cheat on her boyfriend 4 times with 4 different men.
iZombie,"The 2 guys at the bar, her dead ex, and there was one  more I cant remember. And yes. Kissing IS cheating."
iZombie,I did.
iZombie,How are you gonna say that I sound like an incel when you don't even know what it means?
iZombie,How about her dead ex she was making out with or those 2 dudes at the bar? Pay attention.
iZombie,"Ghosts is a much better vehicle for her. I liked iZombie, but was pretty happy when they finally put it out of its misery. I hope Ghosts goes 10 seasons"
iZombie,"That’s kind of the point of his character though. He was literally a corner drug dealer, selling party drugs to college kids and then he falls into a short lived and very profitable blackmail business. 


His larger ‘success’ only happens after Stacy Boss gets run out of town and he takes over that and then when he usurps his dad’s import business."
iZombie,And? I'm not allowed to be passionate about a subject because its fiction?
iZombie,"She doesn’t look that much like Kristen Bell. And their characters may have some similarities, because of the creator and writers, but as actors they are very different. And… Rose McIver deserves way more credit for what she pulled off than saying saying she’s just a carbon copy of Kristen bell in Veronica mars. iZombie wouldn’t have worked AT ALL, without her. I guarantee the show would have been canceled early or never even picked up if it weren’t for her."
iZombie,"That isn’t true at all. Major became totally caricatured every brain he ate, like the pro wrestler. And so did Ravi. You just don’t like seeing a woman act like a buffoon lol. Yeah the brains became more over the top as the show went along. But it was the same with all the characters, she just had way more obviously."
iZombie,">This is like getting mad at The 100 because the show’s plot didn’t make any sense and they blew up their own premise every season, usually by literally blowing it up.

This is the perfect description of The 100 and why I loved watching it"
iZombie,"That show never got enough credit for how tremendously awesomely insane it was. Like when (mild spoiler) cannabalism happens, I thought, of course they had to throw that into the plot at some point."
iZombie,"She does some a lot better than others. Most are just caricatures of types of people, like when she eats frat boy brains.


I really enjoyed the show, but I always get confused about the transition that intros Filmore-Graves.


Also, the puns! Filmore-Graves, Major Lilliwhite, Liv Moore. There’s so much ham in this show I clogged an artery."
iZombie,Lol I just read the plot synopsis and it looks like at least the setup of the story is pretty close
iZombie,There's comics??? Omg how did I not know this
iZombie,"Oh. I'm sorry. I only posted on the television sub about a TV show. What, do you want a formulative essay on how the TV came to be? Jesus."
iZombie,"It's a tortured metaphor, but I'll allow it."
iZombie,How can you not.
iZombie,"People write whole books to support their horrible opinions, they can still be written off as bad opinions easily, what’s your point?"
iZombie,"Ummm, the private military contractor is called Filmore-Graves… Fill More Graves…"
iZombie,"You are watching a cw zombie girl show, literally would be more surprised if it wasn't a soap operas. 

Also using this reply to say alyson michalka is one of the hottest people to have ever lived and shame on you for trying to take that away from us."
iZombie,"My bad! I bought the omnibus and forgot it was a series! 

And agreed, he's so good!"
iZombie,Yeah my thoughts exactly.
iZombie,"A rating of 6/10 is slightly above average....I agree. 

  
Also I never said anything about what a 7/10 is. 

&#x200B;

But a 7 is better then a 6.   


If I saw a show had a 6 I may pass on it...a 7 I would be more inclined to check it out."
iZombie,"There are many instances in the show where she displays quite a bit of willpower to overcome what the brains are making her want to do. Yes, she doesn’t always do that and she gives into the brain sometimes too, sometimes a positive thing, sometimes not. She screwed up sometimes. She’s still a human being, she’s struggling with something nobody could know what is like. That’s kinda the point of the show, she’s still human. She still makes mistakes, still try’s to do the right thing, but makes mistakes. Like we all do. Your obsessed with this cheating thing. Get over it. She fucked up. She accepted the consequences. That’s life. Get over it."
iZombie,"Politely, then maybe you are not the intended audience for female-centric shows, because that is the plot point of every single female-centric show. (just as male-centric shows how their own tropes)."
iZombie,"The boyfriend she dated for 2 seconds, that nobody cared about, lol. Your acting like their relationship was the main draw for the show. It wasn’t, at all. You sure seem to be super judgy and hostile to female characters. Like a female has to be perfect in order to be likable or worthy of compassion. Yet you love Blaine. A murderer of teenagers and an overall despicable person. This OG post is just the rant of some misogynistic dweeb who hates women. Period."
iZombie,[deleted]
iZombie,"Lol, wow. You have an odd idea of what you consider to be cheating. Is making out with a pillow cheating? Making out with an imaginary person, that isn’t there, isn’t cheating lol. She was making out with thin air. And also…she had been on like one date with Justin. They weren’t a couple"
iZombie,I like Ghosts.  It's light-hearted and fun which is a much needed break from reality these days.
iZombie,"Haven't seen it yet, since it's on CBS.  I never watch regular TV, so unless and until it makes its way to Netflix of Amazon Prime, I guess I'll be missing out."
iZombie,"While I definitely prefer Ghosts overall, iZombie gave her way more to do, and she was good at the majority of what it gave her to do, so I feel like the latter was the better vehicle for her acting even though the former has been excellent."
The Flash,"I love Legends of Tomorrow, but I also think it would be very on brand if they got left out of the Arrowverse finale."
The Flash,"While the Arrowverse is much more bad than good at this point, I'll still have fond memories of the good seasons of some of the shows in the early to mid 2010s"
The Flash,"I expected this news, but it still excites me. I always liked relationship Barry and Oliver's relationship and comradery"
The Flash,"So it seems that at least one cast member of each Arrowverse show will return in the final season of The Flash for a last hurrah. I mean, Wally is from Flash but he was in Legends for some time, so that kinda counts?"
The Flash,"This is cool at least, one last hurrah for the Arrowverse. Although the Arrowverse had a grim end, it’s still impressive overall with 710(!) episodes in total."
The Flash,Stephen Amell? The wrestler?
The Flash,It feels like the end of the arrowverse for good. I fell off after crisis but I really do have good memories about these shows. Arrow was the reason I got on reddit (I needed somewhere to talk about season 4 lol)
The Flash,yeah nice to see that the arrowverse seems to be getting a proper finale
The Flash,i was so confused when he died and because The Spectre or whatever the fuck happened because all of that character stuff happened offscreen .. he dies. they find him again and hes like I'm no longer Oliver Queen.. like OK. what the fuck happened? I don't read comic books so i have no idea
The Flash,"Now all we need is closure for the Legends, even if it means just bringing Sara back and explaining how they escaped Time Prison."
The Flash,"The Arrowverse crossovers were usually the best part of their respective seasons. I haven't watched any of those shows in years but the crossover episodes were always enjoyable. 

So if the final season of Flash is going to be a cameo fest I'm all for it."
The Flash,That’s great news. I’m hyped.
The Flash,yeah just woke up and this put me in a good mood
The Flash,"I  stopped watching the Arrowverse after Crisis, but Im defo watching this to see the return of Oliver. The whole verse popped off when I was in high school (and still had friends), this final season feels like an end of an era. To the fellow 2000s kids, what have we got left from our childhood? Only One Piece?"
The Flash,He coming back as a ghost? Didn’t he die as Spector?
The Flash,"Huge spoilers, do not read unless you want to know what happens this season:  >!Someone tells Barry to run!<"
The Flash,They shouldn't have cancelled DC Legends
The Flash,But will we get to see Diggle finally put on the ring?!?
The Flash,"Hot damn, it really is ending isnt it?  As much as Arrowverse flopped over the years its still gonna be sad to close out this take on the DC Universe."
The Flash,"I'm not gonna pretend it was the highest caliber of television but I enjoyed far more seasons of the two marquee shows of the Arrowverse (Arrow and Flash) than I disliked. The Arrowverse led me to meet my best friends and I'm really grateful to it, so I'm tremendously sad to see it go. I'm glad Amell gets to see it off."
The Flash,"Just saw an ad that Amell did on instagram about a clash of clans knock off praising it for having no ads.  He needs a new agent, because that was rough to watch."
The Flash,But he dead.
The Flash,The Flash is still going? wow
The Flash,"With this and the other returning characters, hopefully this will be a decent end to the Arrowverse.  I doubt they'll have everyone from the different shows, nor should they if they want to tell a cohesive story, but if they can fit more people into this season naturally, I'd be all for it."
The Flash,"This guy was my spin instructor in a Toronto. As a teacher, he was meh but, good lord, that face and body brought all the girls to the yard."
The Flash,Can’t believe this show went on for this long. I stopped watching after season 3 honestly it was mostly filler and final few episodes few in the middle and the beginning episode ever connected. Which is pretty exhausting and boring after a while.
The Flash,Truly a shame that DC and Warner Bros. has wasted so much money. So much money. These nonsense CW shows.. Snyderverse… the Batgirl film… All a waste.
The Flash,"I can't wait to not see this.

Don't get me wrong. Loved these shows, but they just ran the Flash into the ground."
The Flash,"As a lifelong Arrowverse fan, I was so happy to see this news. Cannot wait until the season 9 premiere."
The Flash,"But isn't the character supposed to be kind of...dead?

Oh, I know.  That never stopped them before."
The Flash,"The Flash... heck I thought that show had ended or had been dumped. I hadn't seen it on the CW app on my Roku for such a long time, pre-Covid. I guess I'll have to go back and find it again and start rewatching."
The Flash,"TIL The Flash is still airing. 

Since they took weekly episodes off Hulu and put them on Netflix months after release I've stopped watching the CW Arrowverse."
The Flash,Wow. TIL they still make the CW superhero shows.
The Flash,"Not surprisingly at all. If anything is surprising it that took this to him into an episode since arrow ended. 

I was disappointed that they created a justice league at the end of crisis and never did anything with it. Between Covid, WB being mess with their DC plans, batwoman being a complete cluster fuck behind the scenes, and supergirl moving on was just too much for them to handle."
The Flash,"I stopped watching this show after season 1, is the rest of it worth it?"
The Flash,I forgot this show ever existed
The Flash,I don't think even Stephen can save the giant floppy turd sandwich this has turned into.
The Flash,Genuinely did not know this show was still going on.
The Flash,"I'm hoping they bring Wally West out in full [speed force fabulous](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/keiynan-lonsdale-sexuality). The CW Arrowverse audience has been very welcoming to LGBTQ characters, I think it would be great if Keiyan had his moment to shine."
The Flash,Watch the Legends get a little note during the credits of Flash.
The Flash,"Legends was by far the best Arrowverse show and the only one I wanted to see continue. 

I would love if we get one throwaway line joking about them just so we know they aren't in prison anymore."
The Flash,a couple of the actresses were spotted in british columbia recently so it could maybe  be for the flash
The Flash,"Arrow and Flash Seasons 1-2 are my favorites, especially the first seasons."
The Flash,"Yeah, these shows went on much longer than they should have, honestly. Arrowverse was so good for 3 seasons. Same with Flash. But, I absolutely love Ammell."
The Flash,"Tbh it was one of the best character interactions in those shows, and i wish they had done a bit more within their own shows to establish their friendship rather than just their bonding in the crossovers.

You dont even need to show the other character, just like ollie walks into a scene and someone asks ""how was drinks with Barry"" or something, like throwaway dialogue that shows they are friends behind the scenes.

That being said, the stuff they did show was always really good, like they deff wrote them as 2 friends that 100% trusted each other."
The Flash,"This is why Elseworlds outshined COIE for me.  It was just a chance for Amell and Gustin to do a double act and they shined every time they shared the screen.  [My favorite moment](https://youtu.be/ee9KX6-F-QU?t=109) was when Barry as Oliver is talking to Ruby Rose and saying that ""Oliver"" would never dare to compare himself to a badass like Batman.  The dirty look Actual Ollie gives Barry in the background, and Barry's smirk, were gold."
The Flash,"It wouldn't surprise me if they announce Caity Lotz and Melissa Benoist at a later date. They seem to be doing their best to make this ninth season of The Flash a proper send-off for the characters and the Arrowverse as a whole, so they might as well milk it and announce more returning characters over time."
The Flash,That’s a good amount for a universe
The Flash,"> with 710(!) episodes in total.

I doubt this is ever repeated again on network TV, Trek is at over 800 but that took fifty years."
The Flash,Is Superman and Lois not part of Arrowverse?
The Flash,"Same.  No one in my orbit was dumb enough to follow these shows so for a while I didnt have anyone to talk about it with.  Forget exactly how, but I found the FlashTV subreddit and with that I was off to the races."
The Flash,[deleted]
The Flash,"It doesn’t happen off screen, it’s like the second or third episode of Crisis.

He dies so they use Constantine to find a Lazurus Pit on a new earth to bring him back. They then have to go to get his soul like they did last time the pit was used.

They find his soul but he doesn’t go back because he gets asked to be a Spectre which leads him to saving the paragons"
The Flash,"> I don't read comic books so i have no idea

It's okay, neither do the writers most of the seasons anyway."
The Flash,"> I don't read comic books so i have no idea

Reading comic books honestly doesn't help someone to figure out what the hell is going on in the Arrowverse. In fact it makes it harder to understand sometimes."
The Flash,"I stopped following Legends after S4 but it's a shame it didn't get an ending like Arrow, Supergirl, and Flash. I hope at least one cast member returns in The Flash S9."
The Flash,"Even though I wish it hadn’t been cancelled, I kind of like The Legends having a “Here we go again!” ending."
The Flash,"Dragonball is still around, kind of. Also, Bleach is doing a final Anime arc. Stargate might be coming back!"
The Flash,Or The Flash goes back in time and they redo one of their previous team-ups. That would be my guess.
The Flash,"Iris, who hasn’t had any use at all since Season 1 and whom has been outshone by every potential Barry Allen love interest: “We ArE tHe FlAsH!”"
The Flash,"No, he rejected the ring during season 8 of The Flash."
The Flash,"Dude, it got so *weird* in between. Not only did they introduce a human representation of the Speedforce that just happened to look like Barry’s mom, they also had other humans as avatars of *Strength force, sage force and still force*."
The Flash,I had the same thought. I haven't watched it since season 3 or 4.
The Flash,"Absolutely not, that’s truly as good as it gets"
The Flash,"Season 2 and 3 were still very good to me when I rewatched some of it. 

I like season 1 as much as the next guy but a lot of the content is filled with generic material for a origin story. The effects are also pretty bad at times but in season 2-3 the effects/CGI is very nice"
The Flash,"I recommend Season 2, they did some fun stuff with the multiverse and Zoom is a cool villain.  After that though, not worth the watch."
The Flash,Yes. If you watch the show for what it is. It’s a great show!
The Flash,Season 2 is fantastic
The Flash,Agreed!
The Flash,"""The Legends died on the way back to their home timeline."""
The Flash,"""Guys, are we really gonna ignore Barry again? It's another crossover.""


""Nate, sit back down. It's the Wynonna Earp finale and the dvr isn't working"""
The Flash,Just Quantum Leap that shit
The Flash,"Outside of Doom Patrol, it's the most comic booky show to ever exist. Legends of Tomorrow was nonsense and it knew it was nonsense. That let everyone have fun with it."
The Flash,"I was so hyped seeing Booster Gold at the end of season 7. Sad we didn't get to see more.

Despite that I felt Legends got a decent run. They really turned the show around after season 1."
The Flash,Which ones?
The Flash,Arrow season 2 was pure gold
The Flash,"Flash is the only one I've managed to stick with up to current.  It's cringe, but it's *my* cringe at this point.  I'm ride or die to the end."
The Flash,"Those seasons and Legends S2-3 are some of the best superhero stuff i've watched.

Especially the season 1 2nd to last flash episode."
The Flash,"Arrow Season 1 was legit. Season 2 wasnt as great but held up, after that, well, we all know."
The Flash,"A loved Arrow season 1. Especially how in the end it turned out that >!whole conspiracy was a nonsensical plan from the main villain to get a revenge on a killer by destroying a place where he lived 20 years ago with apiece of technology that didn't exist all this time, and every rich person in the city going along with it, and thinking it's a great plan.!<

I mean come on, what could be better then that reveal? Right after that I knew, I just *knew*, how great of a writer team this whole franchise has."
The Flash,"Too many mentions of the Flash in Arrow episodes would have broken the suspension of disbelief that anything Oliver was facing was a real issue. Pretty much every problem/villain of arrow bar maybe Damien Darkh could have been sorted with a quick text message to Barry who'd zoom over and sort it in two seconds flat. ""oh, the island is rigged with explosives? No worries!"".

People like to hand-wave it away with ""Barry's busy dealing with reverse-flash/savitar etc"" as if he wasn't off in his own episodes using his speed to run to Italy for pizza at every opportunity.

As it is I think they ended up using him about once a season or so, like when he ran them to Nanda Parbat iirc."
The Flash,"It really was a great dynamic. Barry allowed himself to be mentored and truly appreciated and listened to Oliver’s advice as he knew he was raw. In turn, Ollie learnt from Barry to lighten up a bit and not take the small things for granted"
The Flash,If anyone deserved a proper send-off it's Caity and any of the other cast from LEGENDS OF TOMORROW (whose show got cancelled on a cliffhanger).
The Flash,Won't be too long now if they do announce it. Flash wraps in early March and all these guests the past few days are apparently for episode 9/13.
The Flash,It was but now it’s not.
The Flash,"> His host, Corrigan, meets Oliver in purgatory, which is the island from Arrow, and gives him those celestial powers. When he fights the Anti-Monitor, he births a new multiverse and dies. That's pretty much it.

i have a feeling this was not well explained in the show."
The Flash,"My favorite part of the crossover was when Lyla showed up with a different costume and announced she was Harbinger now and all of the superheroes just accepted it. And then later, Wells does nearly the same thing as Pariah."
The Flash,"> instead of writing a plot that actually made some sense.

Well, that's the entire Arrowverse, not only the crossover.

And as Netflix has proven, good writing is not worth the expensive cost."
The Flash,"> he gets asked to be a Spectre which leads him to saving the paragons

OK but what the hell is a spectre"
The Flash,Its in a [deleted scene for Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gat_sNL1w8).  Its cheap as hell but I still think it should have been included.
The Flash,Or the writers of any of the movies.
The Flash,"> I stopped following Legends after S4 

You should absolutely give the following seasons a shot. It just keeps getting crazier and crazier. They manage to keep it funny and stupid whilst having genuinely good plots and arcs."
The Flash,It was one of the stronger shows through to the end. Most of the characters you know also got their (mostly happy() endings in the seasons since. Highest cast turnover of any of the shows.
The Flash,The classic Futurama approach of ending your show like 3 times on a quasi-“off to the next adventure”-style cliffhanger-ish.
The Flash,I’m loving TYBW but that will probably end next year with their current pace. Not sure what’s happening with Super Season 2
The Flash,Someone told me that at some point Barry's daughter came back from the future
The Flash,Ah that's unfortunate. Thanks.
The Flash,I totally read this in their voices. I miss the Legends so much. Long live Beebo.
The Flash,I’ve never seen a fan base adopt a new religion so quick after the introduction of Beebo and I am here for it
The Flash,You can also tell that the cast and crew had a good time making it which made the show so good.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I got used to the art style by the end of the trailer, but I also feel I've seen the whole movie now."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,This is giving me mad Sly Cooper vibes
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The reactions in this thread would make it easy to believe this interpretation of the turtles is wholly new when this movie is for the latest TV series that ended 2020.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The art style looks like shit.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Is this the Seth Rogan one?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I know i'm not the target audience, and its for kids, but i hate this artstyle, it looks... idk, generic?

also what's with the design, why is everyone looks from the Michael Bay design from that 2014 movies? is this a spinoff or is that the new standard design?"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"It's telling that this show only made it to 39 episodes. The original ran for 193, the 2003 version 155 and the 2012 version 124."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Mystic powers? \*sigh\*
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Leo reminds me of Kyle Schwartz
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"No, seth rogan movie wont come out till 2023"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Rise of the Teenage Mutants is a show that started in 2018 and now it has a movie.

I don’t know what you mean by spin-off as don’t they always reinvent the characters every couple years?."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Generic? How many cartoons in the last decade can you name that look like this?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Everyone is a specific kind of turtle, it's a cool take on them"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I really dislike the turtle design, that’s usually my beef with all these spin offs, they perfected the turtle look in the 90’s yet feel the need to keep changing it for every adaptation."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Very few cartoons that aren't sitcoms hit lengths like that these days.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The first movie had Splinter telepathically reaching out to Leo
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Not everything has to look and feel the same. I’d rather have the variety.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Ignore the haters, that's for the better."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,It looks like Teen Titans Go and all the other cal-art style Cartoon Network shows.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,None of those things look alike.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Not every show is going for the same thing. I wouldn’t watch She-Ra for the fluid action just like I wouldn’t watch Bob’s Burgers for it either.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"*""It looks like cartoons!!!""*"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I personally wanted to see sick anime fights in Bob’s Burgers, but if you can’t appreciate that then idk what to tell you my friend."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Interesting. I hope there will be another quality series like TMNT 2003 or 2012.

But give me a Shredder movie, please."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Still waiting on the Usagi Yojimbo adaptation.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I wouldn’t mind seeing how Shredder became the leader of the foot but I don’t give a fuck about bebop and rocksteady‘s backstory.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Could Usagi Yojimbo get a chance please
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,TMNT: Rise of Bebop
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The day I learned the original super-violent Mirage Studios ***/*** Image Comics *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* comic series that inspired the animated series is set in the same universe as *Spawn* and *Invincible* was a very amusing day for me.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,2003 is my all time favorite. The animation was perfect
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,2003 was so good I bought dvd sets before they disappeared and went up in value.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I loved the 2012 version. Rob Paulsen came back and the show itself had a lot of similarities to the 80s one but didn't copy it. It actually had a continuous storyline from season to season and had a few surprises and callbacks
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"In the original Mirage comics, they did a story where Raph got a leech on his foot and it mutated into this human sized leech monster. I'd absolutely love an adaption of that arc.


Or the Last Ronin!"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Still hoping for a proper Usagi Yojimbo adaptation
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,You see the trailer for the new show? I want to not exist for a little while
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,90's kids hear the theme song loud and clear without needing to click the link.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,This used to get me so hyped. This an the X-Men theme song.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,April was when I knew I was going to be a straight man
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,man theme songs used to be hype as shit.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"In the UK it had to be changed to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles  
  
https://www.ohmyzod.com/retrospectives/teenage-mutant-hero-turtles"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Oh man, I was obsessed with the Turtles when I was a kid. I watched this show religiously, I collected all of the playing cards, I had all of the action figures (April was the hardest one to find), and my friends and I were at the movie opening night. I don't think people realize how they were such a big part of pop culture at the time. They were literally everywhere. There was a touring concert, they were on Oprah, there were countless Turtle food products and merchandise. It was huge. This song definitely brings me back."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Back when journalism and underground rebels fought against mainstream corrupted gangs and corporations like the foot
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Fuck..... It was a simpler time
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"My favorite Turtle would always change depending on the episode. Still, at 39 years old, Mikey is still my absolute favorite as he was when I was a child."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,is this on any streaming service?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I remember the Saturday morning this show debuted in 1987. I was sitting on the floor of my father's living room creating a character for the TMNT role playing game. My 11 year old brain exploded in that moment!...  'Clang!? Did you say Clang!?'
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Nothing got you juiced up quite like '80s '90s cartoon intros. This one is right up there with Thundercats.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,My god this shit SLAPS
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,This is the only one that matters
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,German version also pretty good
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Man this brings back memories... it's up there with X-men
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"When I was a kid, I had to listen to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles as Ninjas were too violent."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Nope, not listening to it

The last thing I want stuck in my head while I'm writing a midterm is the theme to TMNT"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"FUN FACT: Chuck Lorre wrote the theme song.

Seriously."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,MICHAELANGELO IS A PARTY DUDE!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Surfs up dude!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"And that's a fact, Jack!"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,1234 Turtles!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Haha
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Im sure you've all heard this, but for those who havent, the xmen theme song is basically Whitney Houston's im your baby tonight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWP8vMkAdmA"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Why do millennials hate Gambit!?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,And the 90s animated Spiderman song
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,yes
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"You go back to some shows and the main theme was the best thing about them; Bucky O'Hare, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, M.A.S.K..."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Swat Kats and all the Disney jams immediately come to mind.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I still get hyped by the intro of [King Arthur and the Knights of Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuZ2jzxYEhg)
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Yup. Also we could get imitation sai blades and katanas, but no nunchucks! Those were too dangerous and got banned!"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Oddly, with the ninja turtle action figures about 7 or 8 years ago, April was the hardest to find as well."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I really liked TMNT from the early 2000's
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,2003 series was by far the best and most accurate to the source
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"A couple of interesting facts.
He is also the voice that shouts out the random things like “Hey, get a grip.” He also didn’t get any royalties for the song, but I think he’s doing just fine."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I thought it was Pusha T
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Shut the front door! TIL...
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,He also was a writer on Pole Position (which had a better theme).
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,That's a lot of turtles!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Gambit was the best, especially since he used to try to bang Rogue at every opportunity"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,What? Gambit was easily the coolest X-men. Cyclops was a big dork and no one wanted to be him.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,is this a joke i'm not aware of? i'm millenial and Gambit was always my favorite.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Gambit was my favorite
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,It was Cyclops that most people did not care about.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Because they are *WEAK.*
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Because he hits on women.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,the intro to the GI Joe movie is so fuckin hype
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,It's also why they stopped being used in the show.  Michelangelo started using the grappling hook.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I heard the 2012 Nickelodeon series was good as well
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Yeah, I think he's doing just fine.

Also, I'm pretty sure that his decision to make Charlie in *Two and a Half Men* a jingle writer was inspired by his earlier career."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,That was McDonald’s
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"In a coma. 

Doesn’t matter. Had sex."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"no joke, its just every movie and game typically leaves Gambit out. A few rare exceptions with the few diablo type games and fighting games or a cameo. 

Poor Gambit. Some day Remy... some day"
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,He was the leader
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,There’s at least two. One was def better than the other. Got to get tough >>>>> GI Joe is there.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,That show was great. The theme song was badass as well. My cousin and I memorized the rap.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Now I need to go and listen to that song even though it will curse me and I'll get this stuck in my head the rest of the day.  Thanks!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,...But... the millennials aren't the ones making the games or movies?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"but the games and movies are targeting them. So I dunno, I was just making a joke."
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Not a huge fan of the designs here, but I imagine I'm not really the target audience anymore"
The Great British Baking Show,"Another wholesome British reality show that deserves more attention is The Repair Shop[1].  It's like a combination of The Antiques Road Show and Adam Savages Tested. 

[1] [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0tpFmcChPs)

Edit: had the wrong link"
The Great British Baking Show,"This show was clutch for me during the height of the quarantine. (Almost) Everyone is so nice to each other, they help each other out, and seem to really enjoy just being there because they love baking. Even when they judges really throw shade, it's (almost) always tempered with, ""but you wouldn't be here if you weren't an absolutely amazing baker, so keep it up."" It's a shame that this atmosphere is such an anomaly for TV, at least in America."
The Great British Baking Show,‘The Great British Bake Off’ if you’re going to put it in quotation marks!
The Great British Baking Show,I laughed my ass off this week. Who knew the busted cake version of David Bowie was what I needed.
The Great British Baking Show,This is the comfort tv that I need all the time.  I think I have watched all episodes available to me three times at this point.
The Great British Baking Show,"If you can find it, i recommend the Great Model Railway Challenge. Similar concept but with model trains!"
The Great British Baking Show,"Is this season on Netflix yet? Where can I find it?

Edit: okay I see it’s on Netflix weekly starting soon."
The Great British Baking Show,"For those who don't know this show, I recommend watching some funny clips and you will laugh your ass off. Some of the UK's top comedians show up and they are all hilarious."
The Great British Baking Show,I also really liked The Big Flower Fight and Blown Away. They focus more on building something creative than contestant drama or bizarre challenges. Chef's Line was also something I think is in the same spirit for cooking shows.
The Great British Baking Show,Oh The Repair Shop is amazing. It's the best show on Television. It's like a beautiful warm hug.
The Great British Baking Show,"There's a show on Netflix thats an American BBQ cooking competition show that you would probably enjoy if you like the wholesome food competition show. Im spacing on the name

E: The American Barbecue Showdown"
The Great British Baking Show,it was great because Pru had praised the design initially and remarked on how beautiful Bowie's facial structure was...and then that happened.
The Great British Baking Show,James Acaster on one of the Celebrity episodes is great for a good laugh. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zky4p5HBYE
The Great British Baking Show,Thanks for the recommendation!
The Great British Baking Show,It is certainly more good natured than US masterchef and the like but it sticks religiously to that American overscripted format where it feels like every moment has been planned meticulously beforehand and makes the whole thing feel very disingenuous. imo of course I found it unwatchable.
The Great British Baking Show,"Queer Eye isn’t competitive, it’s self-improvement, so different from the others. But the way the guys treat the men they meet is so sweet, they genuinely just want them to look and especially feel better. It’s so refreshing for them to meet men who are either middle aged or approaching that age and encouraging them to feel sexy. That’s not a message you see. 

But Bake Off is the absolute pinnacle of this. Haven’t watched since it left the BBC, but the positivity of it all was so calming. It was like whale song. "
The Great British Baking Show,"Masterchef Australia. 
  
60+ episodes this season. Not a single harsh word between contestants."
The Great British Baking Show,Terrace House is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine.
The Great British Baking Show,"I swear Nailed It! Is one of the funniest damn things on Netflix. The reveals never feel mean spirited even though good god there are some disasters. The hosts are charming, the tidbits are actually quite interesting, and the creations they’re copying are so damn cool. 

The fact that there are only 6 episodes a season makes me super sad. Give us more!"
The Great British Baking Show,[deleted]
The Great British Baking Show,Face Off is another great example of a nice reality show.
The Great British Baking Show,Masterchef Australia needs a mention.
The Great British Baking Show,Antiques Roadshow is pretty damned nice.
The Great British Baking Show,"Allow me to introduce you to **Please Take Care of My Refrigerator**.  It's a variety cooking show. and the format is pretty damn entertaining and educational.  Each week, guests bring in their refrigerator and chefs are are pit against each other to make something for the guests. The editing and jokes can be a little jarring at first especially if you are used to Western television,  but it's definitely a nice change from the Western reality tv format.

It's on Netflix, so give it a go."
The Great British Baking Show,"I just watched the first episode of Making It last night and was so pleasantly surprised at how nice they all were. Even when the contestant at the end was eliminated, everyone hugged and gave their well wishes. We could use more light and fun material like this on the air. "
The Great British Baking Show,A bit of wholesome is needed once in a while. Queer eye is my go to when I need something feel good. And good place. 
The Great British Baking Show,"Face Off! They are always so supportive of the ones who go. 

And the ones who are eliminated know they deserve to go (failed to mamage time is like 99% of the reasons they go). "
The Great British Baking Show,"I started watching Queer Eye just for some satisfying makeover do overs one afternoon when I was bored and instead I ended up sobbing my way through both seasons. Awesome show, awesome guys."
The Great British Baking Show,"There was a Korean reality show called Roommates a few years ago. The concept was basically The Real World, but with actual TV / Music personalities. 

Maybe it was the difference in cultures, but DAMN was everyone super nice and supportive of each other. I really liked it, made me feel warm inside. "
The Great British Baking Show,American shows are so competitive like the culture. 
The Great British Baking Show,To echo others I'd say face off other than season 1. The first season has some real toxicity and pettiness that's not really seen for the most part in any other season (an argument or 2 in season 2 or 3 being the only other ones I can think of) 
The Great British Baking Show,My wife and I watch Forged in Fire on the History channel.  Not only is it entertaining watching these people make knifes and historical weapons but the contestants are all respective of each other and often help one another out.  It's a refreshing change then say Ink Master where I enjoy the art but the contestants drama is just too much that I've given up watching it.
The Great British Baking Show,Mine is Outdaughtered. Don't laugh  
The Great British Baking Show,"GBBO has Paul Hollywood as the villain. I agree with others about Face Off, never heard anyone say a bad word about another. "
The Great British Baking Show,"Nailed It isn't really nice. They take amateurs that are in over their heads, provide zero help and straight roast them when they fail. In one episode in particular they're laughing at the dummies for not using the ""blast chiller"". Casuals don't know what a ""blast chiller"" is, Chef Jerkface."
The Great British Baking Show,Wholesome is in right now
The Great British Baking Show,"That's not what people usually mean by ""realit tv."" Reality usually refers to supposedly unscripted drama, not skill competitions or self improvement shows. By this definition mythbusters, cooking with Julia child, and NFL football are all ""reality tv"""
The Great British Baking Show,"Who gives a shit?

Who watches reality TV?

Who watches TV at all anymore?

It's 2018, how much longer are you gonna be spoonfed shit that sort of meets the criteria for shit you wanna watch instead of taking five minutes to find something outside of your cable box that fits ten times better and doesn't foster this idea of how corporations love reality TV as they don't pay for writers or actors."
The Great British Baking Show,"Based on the examples it can be nice, or entertaining, but never both. "
The Great British Baking Show,It's all fake scripted directed bull shit!!! Reality does not do cuts and retakes and hey let's take this scene in a different direction. The only reality on TV is cops and Live PD. All these other show are fake bull shit!!! And most of them don't even have good actors or actresses!
The Great British Baking Show,"Why would anyone want reality TV to be ""nice?""  That's just as far from reality as scripting people to be over-the-top awful.

What about shows that are just genuine?  What about shows that don't have ridiculous melodramatic editing and music?  What about not having an episode recap after every commercial break?


Edit: I guess the votes have answered my question.  People don't want honest, quality tv."
The Great British Baking Show,"I completely agree with Queer Eye. It's such a shame that, despite the glowing positivity, there's a strong vocal minority that still gives the show shit for casting only gay men who fulfill the standard homosexual stereotypes.

Nothing is fun anymore and everything has a glaring flaw that sets social progression back years, apparently."
The Great British Baking Show,"the channel 4 version is actually really good, noel fielding is superb"
The Great British Baking Show,"There really is very little competition in it. There's no cash prize, it's a trophy and a lunch IIRC. Americans could learn a thing or two"
The Great British Baking Show,"I saw an episode of the new Celeb version where it was for Stand Up For Cancer and it was downright charming... and so, *so* much harsher in hindsight when it came out that one of the bakers was diagnosed with cancer."
The Great British Baking Show,It’s weird how it’s been going for ten years now and it gets no credit for introducing “nice” reality TV. 
The Great British Baking Show,"Australia has always the nicest reality shows, my ""guilty pleasure"" is House rules, they all seem so nice to each other, even though I only seen one season in its entirety so it might be different with other contestants."
The Great British Baking Show,wait. How many contestants do they have to get 60 episodes?
The Great British Baking Show,"No time to bad mouth another contestant, I gotta film 3 confessionals to cover the next 8 minutes of airtime."
The Great British Baking Show,This show is awful. The host is annoying af. Ruins it for me. 
The Great British Baking Show,"A lot of the specials are also posted on youtube. Mainly the celebrity comedian charity episodes, but they're still great fun.

If you search for them, they'll be under the British title ""Great British Bake-Off"" instead of ""Baking Show"""
The Great British Baking Show,"Technically, they all are.  The Great British Baking Show is the American re-airing of the original British show, The Great British Bake-off.  Not all seasons of Bake-off were aired in the US as part of Baking Show.  So Netflix does have all the episodes of the show that aired in your region."
The Great British Baking Show,"> Please Take Care of My Refrigerator

Korea has some great variety shows that are really positive, and this is one of them! I've only seen a few, so I'm gonna have to catch up on it one of these days.

Throwing a mention out there for the incredible Korean game show, The Genius, which manages to avoid people being assholes despite being a competitive game show, with one exception that got the person in question lambasted across the internet."
The Great British Baking Show,"The one thing that disappointed me about it was the editing. The two things that brought me to it were 1, I adore Poehler and Offerman, and 2, the resemblance in format to GBBO. But man the editing killed it for me. It's hard for me to describe exactly what was wrong. GBBO is so gentle, natural, and almost meandering in its editing. Making It felt too choppy and abrupt, and like they were manufacturing moments and reactions via editing rather than keeping it sincere."
The Great British Baking Show,"While in general I'd agree with you, I would say that in Nailed It the contestants are in on the fun. The judges aren't making fun of them, but rather having fun *with* them. It's vibe is less negative/aggressive and more positive ""having fun with friends"". I  mean, the contestants are often making fun of themselves and even help each other at times. When they talk to the camera it's less ""I need to win this"" and more ""I need to survive this"", which lends to the hilarity."
The Great British Baking Show,The contestants are clearly having a blast and not taking it that seriously.
The Great British Baking Show,It would be pretty expensive if they were all actors and actresses. Reality is supposed to save money and be cheaper than drama.
The Great British Baking Show,A show where people bake and are friendly and make silly puns and enjoy themselves is very genuine to amateur bakers. You’re very cynical. 
The Great British Baking Show,The only thing I’d change is the name. If it wasn’t a reboot I doubt it’d have the word queer in the title. 
The Great British Baking Show,"I have avoided Queer Eye, but I recently watched the first episode of this season. It is extremely wholese and ""nice "". It was great how the group was accepting of the redneck and the redneck was accepting of the group. But ultimately, it s a show that says ""the rest of America has something to learn from gay men."" What's the reciprocal of that? I mean, I really liked that they were truly respectful of the man that he made over (even though they had very  different sensibilities) but what it it was about a gay man getting a spiritual makeover from a group of Christians? Would we be as open to that?

Don't get me wrong. Id love if they came and made over my husband. "

"
The Great British Baking Show,"Also the judges seem to find positive things to call out about even the most dismal performances (after they stop laughing, anyway). The contestants already know they did a bad job so it really is about highlighting the things they did well."
The Great British Baking Show,They are not Union Hollywood actors. That why it's so much cheaper. They are not members of the Screen Actors Guild. SAG 
The Great British Baking Show,"Then I guess my comment would be way off-base if that was the only reality show in existence.  Unfortunately, it’s not even the only one mentioned in the article."
The Great British Baking Show,"I thought ""queer"" had been reclaimed? At least mostly, when the original came out. Or am I now too old and missed it swinging back around?"
The Great British Baking Show,I work in TV and this is untrue
The Great British Baking Show,"So you're telling me you find no enjoyment, sitting with friends and listening to them telling funny anecdotes and stories of their past?
Because that is essentially what 'nice' reality tv is tapping into to. 

It is huge with millenials and the next generation with content creators on YouTube just blogging their lives, mukbanging with friends. All positive. Just chatting and get millions of views. 

It seems you are out of touch. "
The Great British Baking Show,"No you are right, Queer has been reclaimed. It is now a pretty inclusive term for anyone who doesn't completely identify as straight and cis."
The Great British Baking Show,I know a couple of people that were on a couple. They said nobody ever talked about it and nobody from the union ever talked to them or was on location. It was shoot the scenes get paid and go. I guess it might be possible some are and some aren't. And you can tell when what you are watching if it's real or not. 
The Great British Baking Show,"> So you're telling me you find no enjoyment, sitting with friends and listening to them telling funny anecdotes and stories of their past?

...where did I say anything remotely like that?

>Because that is essentially what 'nice' reality tv is tapping into to. 

What reality shows involve people just sitting around chatting with friends?

The Great British Baking Show,They do it in the US i think (Catfish being an obvious example) but they aren't allowed to in the UK.

The Great British Baking Show,Ice road truckers and shipping wars. Two of the worst. I've been in trucking for more than 30 years. Some ridiculous fabricated and exaggerated nonsense. And the this could happen or that and it never does. Storage Wars had their cover blown a few years ago that the network staged all the items in the storage lockers. If one does it the they all do it. I know it's about the money. I didn't get where I am in life believing everything I hear and sew.
The Great British Baking Show,"Those aren't reality TV, those are YouTube videos.  What professional production company is making that kind of content and putting it out for tv broadcast?

Also, wtf is a ""mukbang?"""
The Great British Baking Show,You are so out of touch. Shame. 
The Great British Baking Show,You have nothing of substance to say.  Shame

The Great British Baking Show,"Don’t sleep on Sandi, she’s also great. These two are great at de-stressing the contestants which I don’t believe was always the case with the original hosts. 

And Sandi holding back tears every time she has to send someone home makes her seem like she’s a great. "
The Great British Baking Show,"I miss all the original people of course, but the show is still just lovely. "
The Great British Baking Show,"I am enjoying that series myself, though Noel's wardrobe, as usual, is a bit eye-watering. It did make me realize how short Sandi Toksvig actually is; it's hard to tell on ""QI."""
The Great British Baking Show,"It was the same for me, when I first started it I went it not liking the new hosts but they really grew on me.

I'm still not the biggest fan of Prue, though. She's no Mary Berry."
The Great British Baking Show,he's one of my favorite dudes on the planet
The Great British Baking Show,By the end of the season he feels like a perfect fit
The Great British Baking Show,"I'd never heard of Noel before I saw him on this show, and my initial reaction was ""Bring back Mel & Sue!"" But as the season went along, I saw him grow into the role. He got funnier, and he is great at interacting with the contestants. The way he steps up and makes a joke when someone is getting stressed, then will actually help a little with cooking, makes me feel like he's working hard to help them, to make them feel comfortable. He's now my favorite part of the show. "
The Great British Baking Show,"The new hosts are alright, but I didn't care for the contestants."
The Great British Baking Show,"I know nothing about him except from this show, but he seems like a gentle soul. "
The Great British Baking Show,"I'm nearly done with this season, I was really worried I would hate it with Mary Berry and the two female hosts leaving but Noel Fielding is a lovely surprise! He's adorable and silly and I love their voices when describing the baking creations. "
The Great British Baking Show,"I only started watching last season with the new hosts and I was hooked, brilliant show. I think they are great in their role. I can't make any comparison to the previous incarnation of the show but from a fresh perspective its fantastic."
The Great British Baking Show,"I agree with you about Fielding, he's silly and fun and lightens the atmosphere.  Coupled with Sandi, they seem to have a great time making up skits.  Sandi is hilarious and now hosts QI (I'm an addicted yank) post Stephen Fry.  QI appearances is when I first encountered Noel Fielding.  

I admit I miss Mary Berry, but am willing to give Prue Leith time and a chance.  I particularly enjoyed watching GBBO Masterclass and hope that will continue.  "
The Great British Baking Show,I thought the same as well. First episode I thought WTF is this? As the series progressed I had grown quite fond of the entire updated cast. I just love this show. 
The Great British Baking Show,Noel is just right here.  It’s also my favorite season so far.  Not by much though as I like all the seasons.  
The Great British Baking Show,Guess Im in the minority but I just cant watch it with the new people.  They seem too boring and bland to me.  Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood along with Sue and Mel are irreplaceable.
The Great British Baking Show,No one can replace Mel and Sue (nor Mary Berry!) but Noel was so sweet and kind I loved him.
The Great British Baking Show,Yeah I was worried at first as well. Started watching this season and remembered that I hated the last two meddling host. Then it turned out he was actually perfect for TGBB
The Great British Baking Show,"> Mary Berry was offered 9 Million 

She must regret not accepting that, but the  the Bbc have been known to blacklist performers for going against the wishes of the corporation."
The Great British Baking Show,Dollars not pounds? 
The Great British Baking Show,"Yeah, the new hosts haven't leaned on anyone's baking yet. I just rewatched the first several seasons and I think they did that TWICE."
Scream,They're going to keep playing those parts until shortly after they are claimed by the grave.
Scream,"This show has grown on me so much recently, they were wayyyyyy ahead of their time. I never really liked it when I was younger, but watching it now...I can't stop laughing."
Scream,This movie pulling out ALLL the stops.
Scream,"The fact that the show premiered 20 years ago this year.  


Time waits for no one."
Scream,"Garcia is Ghostface confirmed?

Love to see they're putting out these new mini-episodes/promos so casually. Why does it feel like Dangle looks so much older than he did in 'It's a Wonderful Heist,' though?"
Scream,The greatest show ever! I'm so glad they are making new seasons!!
Scream,this show is still on?
Scream,We deserve no less/more.
Scream,Same! My mom used to be a firefighter back in the 70s and one day when I put this on with her there she remarked that any scenes where the squad would go harass the fire station was unfortunately accurate 😂
Scream,"Thomas Lennon is aging and I don’t like that one bit. For thirty years he’s looked more or less like he did in The State, and that was comforting."
Scream,Yea the new episodes are fantastic!
Scream,oh my god please introduce her to Tacoma F.D. if she isn't already watching it
Scream,Where are the new episodes?
Scream,"We'll have to check it out, thx!"
Scream,Roku
Scream,"I actually started rewatching it!  I think it was the first episode, during the murder scene with the texting and then posting on Twitter/FB or whatever that she needed help while being murdered--I always forget how much I love that scene."
Scream,Chad radwell is hysterical and I’m glad Glen Powell is starting to get more roles
Scream,Denise Hemphill is a goated tv character
Scream,I loved this show when it came out! Season one was such a fun ride and had so many quotable moments. I did never finish season 2 but maybe nows the time to try it again.
Scream,Just started watching it for the first time! Is it true you should stop after the first season? That’s what a roommate told me a few years ago anyways
Scream,Season 1 chad (played by Glenn Powell of Top Gun Maverick) was AMAZING
Scream,"Chanel-O-Ween is the most brilliant parody ever.

[Clip.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6IziijhBI)
[And the follow up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t62_hlRQepU)"
Scream,I loved this show. Billie Lourd’s Chanel 3 was my favorite Chanel.
Scream,Agreed! I wish there was more - I just keep rewatching the two seasons there are haha
Scream,That theme song is a straight up Halloween jam.
Scream,I watch it every Halloween. It’s great.
Scream,"I don't know how he did it but this is somehow Ryan Murphy's most consistent show, in the sense that the endings actually line up with the tone of how the show started and the writing doesn't get any more or less insane than how it started out. Which makes it one of the only of his shows I've been able to enjoy the entire season of."
Scream,"A season 3 would have been so interesting after the reveal in season 2 that >!grace, the protagonist of the first season, went insane after the events of the first season and the dad, seeking revenge in the 2nd season against chanel, died doing so so seeing grace, a protagonist, return in a hypothetical S3 as the villain would've been neat!<."
Scream,Season 1 was so much fun. One of the few times all of the Ryan Murphy hallmarks really worked for me. Season 2 was unfortunately a downgrade that I never got around to finishing.
Scream,"Rewatched it a couple of months ago, top notch stuff indeed. S2 took quite a hit when they benched two of the best characters for some god forsaken reason."
Scream,"I used to love that show when I was 16, maybe I should rewatch it."
Scream,I thought this show was hilarious
Scream,First season is iconic. Don’t watch the second one though
Scream,The first season is great but the second one is trash
Scream,There’s only a handful of times I’ve ever laughed so hard while watching TV as I did when I first saw [that scene.](https://youtu.be/op3H5DY8nXw?t=02m46s)
Scream,The backstreet boys hunt scene is one of my all time faves scenes. [ghetto code](https://youtu.be/nHUYc4HJNYw)
Scream,The fact that she refers to Zayday Williams by her full name always kills me
Scream,"If you watch the first and love it, watch the second. It’s a little worse but still pretty fun. If you watch the first and just mildly enjoyed it… nah, probably skip the second. It isn’t gonna improve the experience."
Scream,"Like most Ryan Murphy shows, all of the really great ideas are used in season 1. I never finished 2 but it's hardly a disaster, just a pretty big step down. Everyone is still having fun and there's still good moments."
Scream,"Second season isn't nearly as good as the first and kills off some characters that probably would have been better to keep on, but it's still mostly fun overall. Deciding to just let the show be a one season thing is a good idea as it lets you leave the show with it feeling like a completed thing. But there's still enjoyment to be found in Season 2 even though it ends on more of an unresolved note than the first season."
Scream,"No, the first season is better but the second season is super fun too"
Scream,I loved the first season and the second one made me so bored I was thinking about dropping the dhow altogether.
Scream,Nope.
Scream,"YES! It was such stupid, campy, hilarious, fun!"
Scream,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"
Scream,Ok thanks for the feedback! I will plan on watching it in full then! Emma Roberts kills in her Mean Girl role ;)
Scream,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"
Scream,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"
Scream,"I finished the second season! It was hilarious the whole way through! And if I didn’t watch the last 30 seconds could have been a good closing to the series ha, but I’ll just pretend cliffhanger was an open ending/didn’t happen ha"
Scream,HBO to Naughty Dog: “ima need you to make a third game or we’ll write our own part three”
Scream,But did you know that diarrhea is hereditary?
Scream,Roughly 20% growth episode on episode is insane. These numbers are insane
Scream,Execs everywhere now combing over every video game ever
Scream,I’ve been loving this show so much. I’m so glad someone who actually cares for the source material is making this show.
Scream,should hopefully keep steady til final.
Scream,"How do the ratings compare between Friday and Sunday nights in the US? I know there are games on other channels on Sunday, but aren't a lot of people out on a Friday night?"
Scream,"Crazy thing about well made shows: people watch them. 

Together we can stop shitty entertainment, but we need to work together on this people"
Scream,"Said it the the second week, I'll say it again

Season finale will have HOTD finale numbers, 10+M."
Scream,Well it helps that the show is really good. Not many shows live up to the hype this had. As a Halo fan I gave up on the show. I’m sure the relative loyalty of the source is retaining fans.
Scream,Aw the IMDB review bombing is working real well
Scream,[deleted]
Scream,"The more I enjoy this great show, the sadder I feel about how they absolutely butchered the Witcher and the Wheel of Time..."
Scream,This show is absolutely killing it!
Scream,"i have not been a hype man for this show at all and i gotta say it's the best videogame adaptation that i know of. typical HBO quality in regards to everything. every episode has been solid and last week's was phenomenal and reminded me of what the walking dead could have been if it was on HBO.

if they push this to two or three seasons by adapting the second game i can totally see it becoming an all-timer for the network. the people making this show know what they're doing."
Scream,"recipe to success is very simple

\- simple story

\- complex characters"
Scream,Have they mentioned whether season 1 is the full game? Because already episode 5…meaning only 4 hours left of story which blows my mind.
Scream,"**It's the behemoth that keeps on growing:**

>Episode 4 of *THE LAST OF US* delivered another series high Sunday night, with 7.5 million viewers across HBO Max and linear telecasts. Viewership was up 17% from Episode 3 last Sunday and 60% above the series debut night in January. Viewing is based on Nielsen and first party data. The series has grown its audience each Sunday night with the release of new episodes."
Scream,cant stop the pedro train
Scream,Season 2 is going to be off the hook.
Scream,Not that surprising consider this is its first week without NFL playoffs.
Scream,"I'm one of the people who helped it grow this weekend.  We hadn't checked it out yet, but I kept hearing so much good feedback about the 3rd episode that I finally decided to check the show out.  My wife and I watched the first episode Friday night and were instantly hooked.  What a well written, directed and acted show so far.

The 3rd episode was a masterpiece, imo.  I've never been so emotionally invested in a pair of one-off characters before.  My wife had tears in her eyes for half the episode.  Not going to elaborate to avoid spoilers.  

Only 4 episodes so far, but no clunkers and no filler.  If it keeps up this pace, it will be my favorite new show since The Expanse."
Scream,"Oh, so you mean all the right wing backlash because episode three had some gay dudes in it amounted to nothing?

Shocker.

These people might be loud assholes, but they’re the minority and they’re slowly being relegated to the sad pages of history."
Scream,A truly impressive video game to TV series adaptation so far. They deviate from the source material when it makes for a better story and I'm here for it
Scream,"You know what?  Good for everyone involved.  When people make a good product to tell a good story everybody wins.  I'm looking forward to the season closing out so I can watch it all in one go and I'll do the same in the second season, too."
Scream,"I love how terminally online bigots said it would drop like crazy after the third episode and then this happens. Like even I expected a slight drop, but it didn't come. This is absolutely insane."
Scream,Surely this can’t be true. A bunch of people online told me that HBO pushing their woke agenda in Ep. 3 was going to kill the show??
Scream,maybe an unpopular opinion but i felt Ep. 4 was the best one so far. only wish it was longer. great character development in this one and still some cool action scenes
Scream,This is easily one of the best shows I’ve ever seen.
Scream,"The creative talent behind this show is off the chain. Craig Mazin has done a tremendous job adapting the source material and building upon an already incredible story. The casting across the board has been A+. The decision to have Peter Hoar direct Ep.3 was a stroke of genius, with his previous work on It's a Sin making total sense. Just goes to show what can happen when talented people are passionate about a project and given the means to see their vision come about."
Scream,"And this is in spite of half of Canadians being left unable to watch it for a couple of hours because our telecom company, bell, is garbage."
Scream,Praise Druckmann. The man is just on a roll every week with the amazing episodes
Scream,Dad jokes delivered!
Scream,"It's amazing what can be achieved when they create a show that is faithful to the spirit of the source material, rather than trying to make wholesale changes in an almost condescending fashion. No one cares about a particular writer or directors idea for how to reimagine a beloved IP just for the sake of making it their own. The audience want the IP. They want what makes that series great.

I don't want an Assassin's Creed movie where the dude is jumping around in some virtual room for example instead of going into the animus as you do in every single game. What the fuck was that even? They completely missed what mattered"
Scream,I have been doing my part to get as many people into it as possible haha
Scream,"Pedro Pascal seems like a magnet to drawing viewers. GoT, Mandalorian, Last of Us he’s doing great"
Scream,This almost guarantees a third last of us game and probably a 3rd season of the show also.
Scream,Good show
Scream,They can easily stretch part 2 into 2 seasons
Scream,"Everyone and their mother is on this.

Which is great, it's a good story and they're doing a good job since they care.

Thing is that the game is cinematic on its own, and I'm glad new people are exposed to it (which was definitely one of the goals) but don't forget, It isn't totally new. So, I'm glad the adaptation is good but the story existed in the last 10 years at this point.

I guess this main stream we-discovered-something-amazing all of a sudden, kinda bugs me, I dunno."
Scream,But but but woke broke or w/e!?
Scream,I think ep4 was pretty mild compared to ep3. So I wonder if that surge will continue.
Scream,"Last episode was okay, first three were huge."
Scream,"It's so good. Not to harp on that dead horse velma, but when the wife and I decided to catch up on last of us..we had to get through three velma promotions to find it in the search bar. They're really advertising that sucker hard in front of last of us"
Scream,"While this news is exciting, the last episode was the least entertaining so far."
Scream,I must be the only person who felt that the show is severely overrated.
Scream,I don’t remember the last time there was so much hype surrounding a show. I’m trying to wait until the seasons over to binge it but it’s getting harder each week!
Scream,So tripping over the fact I watched the new episode with my mom of all people because apparently she is really into it. Pretty cool how its even pulling in people who have no frame of reference of the source material who are just loving it.
Scream,"Crazy how if you make a good show, people will watch it."
Scream,"Three seasons would be good, please dont drag it out forever like the walking dead"
Scream,"I'm curious if the show is also driving sales/downloads of the game. I think it's one of the ps plus classics they're giving away. 

Though it's been out for so long and in the video game world people have been raving about it since release, so I don't even know how big any untapped market could be."
The Virgin Psychics,"Just started watching this and absolutely LOVED it, it’s definitely not a typical superhero show"
The Virgin Psychics,"In case anyone is wondering, the song is “Something for Your Mind” by Superorganism, and yes that is the actual band appearing in the show."
The Virgin Psychics,It's incredible how fast this series exited the collective mind. Nobody seems to talk about it.
The Virgin Psychics,I wish some of the characters from Legion would pop up in Loki.  The production design for the TVA seems heavily inspired by Legion.
The Virgin Psychics,I found Switch exceptionally attractive.  Shame her role basically disappeared after the first couple of episodes of that season.
The Virgin Psychics,I wish the whole season had been a bit more inspired like this.
The Virgin Psychics,Well that was odd
The Virgin Psychics,Love this show and how absolutely trippy and fucked up it was willing to get to tell its story.
The Virgin Psychics,I really like this scence and a lot of the first half of season 3. I think the second of the season really drags
The Virgin Psychics,Best Marvel television show.
The Virgin Psychics,I watched it years ago with the closed captioning on and thought the word `SUPERORGANISM` was explaining the nature Legion’s relationship with his followers.
The Virgin Psychics,It appeared on Fifa soundtrack the same year this season came out so when they played it on the show I literally did the Leo DiCaprio pointing at the tv meme ha
The Virgin Psychics,"Their first album was my most listened to of 2018, I even went and saw them live. (One of the weirdest concerts I’ve ever seen btw) Try as I might though, I just really couldn’t get into their new album World Wide Pop."
The Virgin Psychics,"WOW I didn’t realise it was also the actual band, damn"
The Virgin Psychics,Thought it was them
The Virgin Psychics,"My family talks about it all the time. The third season especially clicked really well with us. I've never read marvel comics, so I was completely blown away by >!David being the son of Charles Xavier!<. I think that there's just so much media that when a show ends, the people who watched it will talk about it, but it doesn't leave certain circles. Like Atlanta, another FX show. Very satisfying ending, to me. Great series. But I haven't seen anyone mention it online since it ended."
The Virgin Psychics,Is it still good?
The Virgin Psychics,"If nothing else, everybody knows MCU's X-Men is coming eventually. There's zero reason they couldn't involve some of the cast into the films/tv shows that follow."
The Virgin Psychics,There was a 3d season?
The Virgin Psychics,Needs a full series Blue Ray release.
The Virgin Psychics,It is an absolute masterpiece of anachronisms. I loved it.
The Virgin Psychics,Yeah. But it does end up having more style than substance.
The Virgin Psychics,"A shorter answer than you're getting is that, yes it's worth watching. Super weird, very memorable, extremely creative."
The Virgin Psychics,"Dan Stevens is wonderful in everything.  Would love to see him in the MCU, even if he doesn't play David."
The Virgin Psychics,Maybe the most style over substance show I’ve ever seen - especially how it resolved - but I really enjoyed it.
The Virgin Psychics,And every now and then we hear Syd saying: *David*
The Virgin Psychics,I'd just like to see him more often in general
The Virgin Psychics,Yup.
The Virgin Psychics,"I watched him in a German film, I’m your Man, and he is just as good in another language!"
The Virgin Psychics,"We have run out of time but want to thank everybody who has watched and enjoyed the show from the bottom of our hearts. Thank you for your questions, sorry we couldn't answer them all and we sincerely hope we'll see you back at Portland Row before too long. 

Joe, Ruby, Cameron and Ali. x"
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: what was your favorite line of dialogue to deliver in season 1?"
The Virgin Psychics,Were you allowed to write on or make additions to the thinking cloth?
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Joe, I don't suppose there's any chance we ever get a proper release of the complete The Adam and Joe Show on Blu-ray is there?"
The Virgin Psychics,To all: is there any footage of the milk gate? It’s been described as the funniest moment on set and fans (me) are curious to see
The Virgin Psychics,"Hi!! Thank you so much for taking time to talk and share with us!! What an incredible adaptation you've gifted us.

For Joe: What was the most difficult and/or rewarding part of the development/pre-pro process for this series?

For Ruby: I saw that you’ve done trapeze! (I’m an aerialist too, with a preference for trapeze/lyra). Have you trained in any other apparatuses? Non-spoiler thoughts on *That* scene in The Empty Grave?

For Ali: Your George has earned such a special place in my heart, thank you for taking such great care of him! What are some of your favorite qualities of George? Any you can relate to?

For Cameron: It's like you walked off straight from the pages as Anthony Lockwood, and we're so grateful. What is your process like for getting into character?

General: Cast birthdays? (For astrological sign reasons 👀)"
The Virgin Psychics,"To the cast & Joe: I've rewatched the show more than 5 times already, if you don't get the greenlight from Netflix for a second season what's the possibility of you switching streaming services? Just asking on behalf of the fandom, we're desperate for more from our absolute favourite cast ever <3"
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Cameron: Having just come out of drama school what were you expecting when it came to getting actual roles? Were you confident in your ability to get a role in this industry or were you like so many other actors unsure of your success?  

Note : You're incredibly talented thank you for gracing our screen with your presence we will forever be in your debt"
The Virgin Psychics,"Brilliant adaptation of an excellent series of books. My Q is directed at Cameron, Ruby and Ali:

Q - what do you imagine Lockwood, Lucy and George would do for a living/hobbies when they hit 20 ish and their ability to see ghosts starts to fade?"
The Virgin Psychics,For Cameron: the books often mention Lockwood's iconic coat being too long and getting in the way. Did you ever have any problems like that on set?
The Virgin Psychics,"As someone who is very conscious of sharp metal objects in close proximity, I get mini heart attacks whenever I see Lockwood or Lucy draw swords within inches of someone standing nearby, or when one of your rapiers stick out behind looking ready to trip someone. 

I'm curious, did anyone ever got hurt on set by the rapiers? Or accidentally poked by your fellow mates?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Hey Joe! Was it written in the script to change Lockwood’s usual pink socks to blue during the party scene to match with Lucy, or was that just an unhinged (in an amazing way) decision by the costume designers?

Show is amazing!!"
The Virgin Psychics,"If the problem finally went away or gifts faded and Lockwood and Co couldn’t be agents, what do you think each character would do for a job?"
The Virgin Psychics,"My question is for whoever wants to answer it, maybe Cameron! I just wanted to know if Lockwood's dark eyebags were all natural or done with makeup? ;)"
The Virgin Psychics,"for Ruby! - 

your northern accent slayed, were you confident going in or did you have a voice coach?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Have you guys read the books and if so what was your favorite? If we get another season are there any particular scenes you are looking forward to filming? Thanks so much for the great adaption, me and my brother loved it."
The Virgin Psychics,Why hasn't Netflix been promoting the show at all? It is truly a hidden gem and deserves more promotion and recognition.
The Virgin Psychics,"This is a wonderful opportunity! Can't thank you enough for it!!

For Joe; How is the process of getting books adapted into a show? I really want to get into the field as a screenwriter/director hopefully, so I was wondering if you also had any advice for someone who has no idea what they're doing 😂

For Ali; I'm so so excited about your character!! I'm Persian myself, so the second I saw your name I was like...can it be? And then you mention ghormeh sabzi and nan khameii and I instantly felt at home. I absolutely love the changes to your character because I've always wanted to see my own culture in a character. And my question is; will there be more cultural exploration for George? Maybe even a nod to kolah Ghermezi (I hope you do know what I'm talking about 😂) 

For Cameron; What's something you love about playing your character? And what's the most challenging part about it? Absolutely love your performance btw!

For Ruby; What are some aspects of your character that you're excited to explore and try to act out? Lucy is such a complex character so mad respect for nailing her character!!"
The Virgin Psychics,Question for Ali: are we going to be seeing more Franklin in future seasons?
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Cameron. 
Do you see any similarities with you and Lockwood?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Hi!! Thank you for the amazing work that you've done in bringing some of my favorite characters and stories to life. Question for Joe: Is there a scene from the books that you really wish you'd have kept in the series, but weren't able to? For Cameron, Ruby, and Ali: What was the most difficult scene(s) to shoot?"
The Virgin Psychics,"This is amazing!

Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: which scene you cherish the most shooting?"
The Virgin Psychics,"to all three of you, how have your friends reacted to your breakthroughs as these iconic characters in a Netflix show that is sure to go down as iconic?"
The Virgin Psychics,Question for everyone: what do you think is the musical taste of each of the main three?  And how do you think the Problem affected the musical industry?
The Virgin Psychics,"Not show related, but for Ali: being that you're a lit student, do you have a favorite book and/or author?!?!"
The Virgin Psychics,"for ruby, cameron and ali: any behind the scenes stories/pranks played/moments?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Which of the trio would win an intense game of Monopoly- Lucy, Lockwood or George? 😂👀"
The Virgin Psychics,for joe! what's a scene from one of the other 3 books do you look forward  to adapting
The Virgin Psychics,[deleted]
The Virgin Psychics,"Hey Joe!

Love this show, 2 questions if you don't mind:

&#x200B;

1. What is your creative process when it comes to building characters and a story? Lockwood and Co was so brilliantly well done and I'd love to learn about your process. Hopefully, the script get's released one day as well :) 
2. How did this show come to be? Were you approached by the author or were you a fan of the books?  It's so rare to find a book-to-show adaptation that was done so well. Would love to hear the story.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to Season 2!"
The Virgin Psychics,"for everyone - There was a lot of iconic london filming locations this season, what other ones would you want to film at in another season?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Hello! This show definitely has a special place in my heart!

My first question is, what can we do on our part to help and ensure the show gets renewed for a second season (besides (re) watching) ?

Second of all, is there some kind of significance to Lockwood's pink socks? What made you make that decision?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Not a question, just a comment, Cam, Ruby and Ali's voices are so soothing. They could honestly record an audiobook and I would buy it.  Lovely trio!"
The Virgin Psychics,"Lockwood and Lucy's relationship is more obvious to the viewer than it is to the reader since the book is from Lucy's point of view, so now we get to see Lockwood's side as well.

My question is, when do you think was the moment Lockwood started to have feelings for Lucy?"
The Virgin Psychics,"To Ruby, Cameron and Ali: 

You guys have mentioned you've seen a few fan-made edits on the show with songs the fandom associates with the characters playing in the background, what songs/music/genres/artists would YOU guys associate with your characters (after all, you know them better than we could ever!)"
The Virgin Psychics,To Cameron: How does it feel to be a heartthrob??
The Virgin Psychics,"If the characters at Portland Row were to get a house pet, what kind of pet would it be?"
The Virgin Psychics,"To Cameron, Ali and Ruby: Assuming all three of you have read all the books, how do you feel about the character of Holly and are you (if at all) anticipating the introduction of this new member of your little family?"
The Virgin Psychics,"I just finished watching the show yesterday.  I absolutely loved it.  I think my favorite thing about the show was that the young adults acted like mature young adults rather than immature/soap opera-esque teenagers.  The three lead actors were incredible, and I never felt like I was watching a “show for kids”.  


As the show creator can you talk about creating this more mature/serious tone? 


For the actors (you guys were amazing-truly blown away), can you talk about your approach to the characters and finding the balance between portraying teenagers but keeping with the more mature tone?  

(Bonus question was it fun using/carrying the swords?  Did you do any training?)"
The Virgin Psychics,"hello, my name is mel, i'm 19, i was a HUGE fan of the book series when i was younger and the netflix show means a great deal to me. thanks so much for taking the time to do this!!

joe: are there any scenes you wish you could've put in the show, but were unable to for any reason? and were there any scenes that you instantly knew you couldn't wait to film?

cameron: as this is your first role, how was your first experience as an actor in a big netflix show like this? and do you have any advice for someone like me who'd like to go into the film industry?

ruby: do you have any of your own little 'headcanons' about lucy - like, any little extra traits that you've given her along the course of you playing her?

ali: how easy was it for you to connect to george as a character, and do you see any similarities and differences between you and him? p.s. i am autistic and i see a lot of myself in george, so thank you so much for bringing this wonderful portrayal of him to the screen!!

all of the characters are so perfect and i genuinely think this is my favourite book to screen adaptation i've ever seen. it stays true to the books, and still manages to put its own special little twist on it, and i really couldn't imagine a better adaptation! thank you so much ❤️"
The Virgin Psychics,Kinda curious what prop/costume/set piece etc from the show are you all most attached to? And may perhaps take home? Lol
The Virgin Psychics,When will season 2 be announced? We're on the edge of our seats! Just give us a hint or something
The Virgin Psychics,"for cameron and ruby: did you expect there to be a separate fanbase for ‘locklyle’ shippers while you were filming, or has it caught you by surprise?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Cameron, Ruby & Ali: Which scene was the most emotional to film?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking your time to answer some of our burning questions! The show was absolutely amazing. It gave me chills, smiles, and tears, and it certainly was true to the books! Every detail was immeasurably impressive and the writing and acting was marvelous! Really hoping for a season two! It’d make my year!

Now, for questions!

* There were some tough and emotional scenes throughout the series. In what ways did you prepare and what was your thought process when it came to these scenes? ( Did you consider the character’s past? Did you think of something sad? Etc.) In this instance for Joe, what made you decide to write these scenes?
* What moment from the books do you wish would have made it on screen?
* Which of the characters do you relate to the most?
* Which episode did you enjoy filming / writing the most and why? Your least favorite episode writing / filming?
* If the trio weren’t having to deal with cyclical missions and ghosts and were to live a normal life, what would do you think they’d be doing?"
The Virgin Psychics,"For Ruby, Cameron and Ali are there certain techniques of acting you used to prepare yourself? And is it different reading the books when preparing to a role, do you pay attention to certain details?

And thank you so so much for portraying this characters so perfectly! Must have been hard work also which is much appreciated."
The Virgin Psychics,Question for everyone: how does it feel bring the leads in such a great show?
The Virgin Psychics,"Loved the show. 
How is it filming with different directors? The show felt consistent, but with different people at the helm it would be easy to see how things could get complicated. Unlike with a movie where usually there's one director leading."
The Virgin Psychics,"I loved the show, and genuinely believe it’s one of the best book to screen adaptations out there. The character-focused storytelling is brilliantly written and acted wonderfully. Here’s my questions: 

For Joe Cornish: When writing this script, since it’s based on books, were there any challenges in adapting the source material, and any really fun aspects? 
 
For the cast: How did you prepare to take on these roles? Is there anything you do to help get into character?"
The Virgin Psychics,"thank you for bringing the series to life in such a beautiful way! this is a question for everyone: if *you* (the actors and joe) were in Stroud's London, do you think you'd be agents? relic men? or something else?"
The Virgin Psychics,for ruby and cameron: how would you describe locklyle?
The Virgin Psychics,for everyone: what career or path do you think your characters would follow in a world without The Problem?
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Ruby: What was it like stepping into this relatively unheard of and new franchise, having no idea as to where it would head (its popularity etc) from something as big as Bridgerton, and what about the Lockwood and Co world appealed to you?"
The Virgin Psychics,For Ruby: What do you think of Lucy's shades of blue wardrobe color? Do you think it matches her character?
The Virgin Psychics,question for ruby: whats a trait about lucy that you can relate to?
The Virgin Psychics,"Hi Joe! Huge fan of your work, love love love the Kid Who Would Be King and am really enjoying Lockwood & Co. 

I love how your work always balances a fantastical element with a grounded universe, while still doing a fair bit of world building. I'm wondering how you approach that kind of world building and how you find that balance?

An optional second question! I deeply admire your ability to write stories about kids that don't talk down to them, and are appealing to adults as well. I'd love to know what drives you to write such engaging stories about kids - is that a conscious choice? And how do you approach creating engaging kid characters?

......and will we ever see another Tintin movie?!?!!?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Love this, love the show! It was wonderful to see Lucy, Lockwood and George come to life in this amazing book adaptation. I would really love a season 2!  
Question for Ruby, Cameron and Ali: What personality trait of your character did you struggle with the most during rehearsal/filming?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Do Joe: Did you have a say in the soundtrack of the show because the songs picked were perfect for the show, a big thank you to whoever selected the soundtrack!"
The Virgin Psychics,"Joe! I've been such an admirer of your work and am a young producer who also loves this genre and space! Thank you for this incredible adaptation and for the thoughtfulness and love that so clearly went into every detail of this show!

You're often known for discovering and working with young talent and I was wondering if you could talk more about how you foster and support them on set/throughout production. What are some things thoughtful producers and creators should think about that help create an environment for young or newer talent to grow and offer their best work?

And secondly I really appreciated how much you involved Jonathan in an adaptation like this, down to what I read somewhere was having him and Ali consult on George's new last name or even some of the details on set or the Thinking Cloth. I find it unfortunately rare that creators are so collaborative with authors of IP being adapted and wondered how you figured out how to strike the right balance?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Hello everyone! Being especially fond of the swordfights, I want to ask to Ruby, Cameron and Ali: did you enjoy learning to use your rapiers? Was it physically demanding?

Thank you everyone for your time!"
The Virgin Psychics,"question for ali,ruby and cameron:what was the moment when you laugh the most while you were filming the scene?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Hello, by any chance, do you take interns?"
The Virgin Psychics,Do you guys have nicknames for each other?
The Virgin Psychics,"hii! what would be on lockwood, lucy and george's shared playlist for their ghosthunting trips?"
The Virgin Psychics,"for the cast - what's one actor that you didn't share many scenes with in the show, but that you wish your character would've interacted with more?"
The Virgin Psychics,what were first and last shootings?
The Virgin Psychics,"were there any scenes that got cut out of final versions of episodes? if yes, could you tell more?"
The Virgin Psychics,question for all of you: which book is your favourite out of L&Co series? (if spoilers are not allowed just say which one out of 5)
The Virgin Psychics,"I just want to show my appreciation for such a wonderful adaptation of one of my favourite book series! I binged all the episodes in a day which shows how much I enjoyed it.

Okay, maybe a quick question for our rising young stars. How do you see yourselves in 5 years time and if there's anything you wish to challenge yourself in other than acting (for example directing, writing, producing etc... Maybe Joe could be your mentor? Haha)? And also if there's any other or specific film genres you wish to play a role in the future?"
The Virgin Psychics,"Question for Ali, Ruby, and Cameron: in the case that Netflix does approve for more seasons, what book are you looking forward to adapting?"
The Virgin Psychics,"on some of bts photos there were dogs on sets, what are their names and how did they end up stealing all the spotlight on those pics?"
Benidorm,"Watch it until it moves from 30 minute episodes to 1 hr episodes. After that, it's all downhill."
Benidorm,">Think UK trailer park boys.

Is it similar to People Just Do Nothing?"
Benidorm,"I love Benidorm, and can't wait for the new series."
Benidorm,I think it's more like Alan Partridge when he's living in the motel.
Dark Matter,"> 'Dark Matter' is based on the novel by Blake Crouch, who is writing and showrunning the series.

First season of 'Wayward Pines', also based on a novel by Blake Crouch, was great, so I'm going to give 'Dark Matter' a shot. 

On a side note, this is the 3rd show on Apple TV+ that has a simialr title to an older TV show: Invasion, Surface, and Dark Matter."
Dark Matter,"Wish the other Dark Matter, never got canceled, such a shame"
Dark Matter,"> In this labyrinth

> Connelly 

I see what you (probably unintentionally) did there, Variety."
Dark Matter,Loved this book! Recursion was wild as well
Dark Matter,Nice. I am a big fan of Blake Crouch. I just finished his new book a few weeks back.
Dark Matter,Is this going to be filmed in Chicago?
Dark Matter,God I fucking love Joel Edgerton. Triple threat
Dark Matter,"Noted smokeshow, Jennifer Connelly"
Dark Matter,I highly recommended Crouch’s new book Upgrade for anyone who liked Dark Matter.
Dark Matter,That multiverse idea sounds like a really cool concept. Reminds me of Primer.
Dark Matter,I read the book which was really good. I always thought it would make a good movie or TV series. Glad to see Hollywood agreed.
Dark Matter,How about continuing the cancelled “Dark Matter”? :(
Dark Matter,"Awesome book, a must read for sci fi fans. Hope the show doesn’t suck!"
Dark Matter,Literally started this book this morning!
Dark Matter,Great book! Perfect for a limited series.
Dark Matter,Read the book twice! I’m excited.
Dark Matter,Didn’t she also do a movie called Dark Water?
Dark Matter,Has Apple TV acquired much of a subscriber base yet? I was tempted to go get The Tragedy of Macbeth but that's about it so far.
Dark Matter,"Oh my fucking god!!!

This novel is insanely fucking good!!!!"
Dark Matter,"…and has also starred in films like “Requiem for a Dream,” “House of Sand and Fog,” and “Blood Diamond.”

Let’s not forget about her turn in “Dark City,” which in addition to being a great late ‘90s sci-fi movie also has the word “Dark” in it. Dark City…Dark Matter…hmm."
Dark Matter,Oh shit this is a great book!
Dark Matter,If you guys thought Kingpin said 'Vanessa' a lot in Daredevil wait to see how many times Jason says 'Daniela'.
Dark Matter,I binged this book in 3 hours last week. Pumped for this!
Dark Matter,"Great book, if they can manage to not fuck it up it could be a very good show."
Dark Matter,"Oh I actually read this book when I was like 14 for summer reading at my highschool. Good book, I actually finished it unlike some of my other summer reading choices"
Dark Matter,Wait…so is Snowpiercer over?
Dark Matter,"Damn thought the old show was coming back.  Sad.



Still it sounds interesting"
Dark Matter,I enjoyed the plot of the book but I definitely think the characters need a lot of work. The lead character was just kind of your run of the mill guy and a lot of the characters didn't feel like they had enough personality. Still definitely interested to see how hard they'll lean into the scifi of it all and if the story will follow the same plot.
Dark Matter,"It’s funny. I read the book earlier this year and Jennifer was the person I saw in my head as the wife. You are welcome, everyone."
Dark Matter,"Ah damn it...

Thought it was coming back for a min! :("
Dark Matter,"I’ll watch anything Jennifer Connelly is in, top gun confirmed she’s still first ballot unanimous hall of fame hottie"
Dark Matter,Going to be confusing with 2 shows named Dark Matter
Dark Matter,I really hope its better than the book
Dark Matter,I LOVE Jennifer Connelly and I HATE multiverse plots. What to do???
Dark Matter,"Here's hoping the show actually makes sense, and removes the weird sexism from the book."
Dark Matter,"Wait..... Is this???

Oh... No its not... Will check It out, I suppose, but.... After that last cliffhanger I thought finally..."
Dark Matter,this book is one of the least scientific science fiction novels I've ever read. It's like He-man science
Dark Matter,"Ok, this is unusual. An older actress playing a wife of a younger actor. Usually its the other way around. 

Not that I would ever blame them when it comes to Jennifer Connelly."
Dark Matter,I'm just here to say. Kill joys was a better show then Dark matter and deserved the dub  over dark matter to not get cancelled
Dark Matter,"Interesting concept let down by the writing, hopefully it will be elevated by these actors."
Dark Matter,🎵I saw your eyes and it made me smile🎵
Dark Matter,ass to ass😳
Dark Matter,H
Dark Matter,Dance Magic Dance!
Dark Matter,"I absolutely loved the book, and Recursion. I can't wait for this show. Apple has been crushing it with their shows, so I have really high hopes."
Dark Matter,"And this got my SyFy Dark Matter loving heart in a twist. I know Malozzi is trying to bring it back, but this is too much to hope for."
Dark Matter,Dark Matter is a brilliant book
Dark Matter,"I liked the second season of Wayward Pines, it was batshit insane.

The incest storyline was great and made my jaw drop."
Dark Matter,"As someone, who is currently re-watching Dark Matter, I was really confused at first, because show was canceled back in a day.

&#x200B;

Wayward Pines first season was phenomenal"
Dark Matter,The book felt pretty surface level and the woman I presume Jennifer Connelly is playing is written really thinly. Hopefully they can flesh the characters out a bit.
Dark Matter,"> First season of 'Wayward Pines'

I remember watching some of that. Got to the first twist and thought it was pretty cool but didn't keep with it. 

Weren't the Duffer brothers (Stranger Things) and M. Night Shyamalan also involved somehow with that?"
Dark Matter,I’m sure some basic local daytime program running between 6am-9am is also called “The Morning Show.”
Dark Matter,"My wife tells me often I was the only person to ever watch or enjoy that show and I’m going to tearfully show her this comment so she knows there are potentially dozens of us. Dozens! Also, this show is Simu Liu and Ruby Rose’s best performances."
Dark Matter,I was excited for a minute that Apple was bringing it back.  I saw the headline said “sci fi” and got even more stoked.  Then skimmed the article and was bummed out.
Dark Matter,Just realized it’s not it. Sad
Dark Matter,"Aww... momentary hope dashed. This new series might be interesting though. Or it may suck, devil's always in the details, how it is done.

Could be just another drama with scifi entry as an excuse. Or it may be a drama that constantly explores the possibilities of mirror worlds intelligently and interestingly."
Dark Matter,Same.  My hopes have been dashed.
Dark Matter,I Loved that show so much.  It was a load of fun.  Still annoyed it was cancelled.
Dark Matter,Seriously. I accidentally got excited for a moment
Dark Matter,First couple episodes were pretty good.   It went of the rails pretty quickly though.
Dark Matter,For real
Dark Matter,"> Wish the other Dark Matter, never got canceled

You don’t need, that comma."
Dark Matter,Oh I just finished Dark Matter last month! Sweet!
Dark Matter,"Check out Upgrade. It came out recently (and Blake Crouch did an AMA), and I enjoyed it the same as the others."
Dark Matter,"Yeah, productions supposed to start in October."
Dark Matter,"I love him too, has a lot of great performances. Have you seen Wish You Were Here?"
Dark Matter,"Crouch is a dang machine, didn’t know he had a new one out"
Dark Matter,"We're reading it now, off to a good start!"
Dark Matter,"Finished it a few weeks ago. Maybe not as mind-blowing as Recursion and Dark Matter, but still an awesome book and **very** fun read. I love his style of writing. It's intricately intelligent, but still easy to read and understand."
Dark Matter,The book goes off the fucking rails with it. Super hyped.
Dark Matter,I’m convinced crouch writes his books with an adaptIon in mind. They seem like they would translate with minimal effort.
Dark Matter,Apple has a good track record. I love their sci-fi shows
Dark Matter,"With how much of a page turner it is, almost done then?"
Dark Matter,Dark City was good…
Dark Matter,It is included in Apple One and iPhones/Macbooks sell insanely well so I assume they have a subscriber base like Amazon's Prime.
Dark Matter,"I thought there was one more season...But yeah, I'm confused now."
Dark Matter,"I thought the same thing about Connelly’s character in Top Gun, ironically."
Dark Matter,Watch Requiem for a Dream.
Dark Matter,"The book was written as a pulpy, fun sci-fi story and it was. Nobody ever once pretended it was hard sci-fi. Weird flex."
Dark Matter,"It's a three year difference, they're basically the same age."
Dark Matter,"All I can think of when I see her is “Ass to ass, baby” and the cumshot scene."
Dark Matter,Oh hell no
Dark Matter,"No, no it was not. By the time Dark Matter was cancelled, Killjoy was a mess and only became even more convoluted."
Dark Matter,"Have you read Recursion? If so, how would you compare it?"
Dark Matter,I loved it
Dark Matter,I dont understand why WP did not catch up with ppls interest. I liked it
Dark Matter,Dozen + 1! I love that show!
Dark Matter,"Dude, Dark Matter is THE SHIT. Such great characters - the way the storyline evolved and twisted and turned was great as well."
Dark Matter,"Killjoys was another show at the same time I thought was very similar, except boring. That got multiple seasons while Dark Matter didn't."
Dark Matter,Loved that show.
Dark Matter,Add me to the list!
Dark Matter,"Me and a friend of mine also watched it. I'm not saying it was perfect...sometimes more of a guilty pleasure, but it was fun space sci-fi that went places."
Dark Matter,Possibly a gross even!
Dark Matter,"That show had the best time loop day episode I have ever seen.

Shame we wont find out more about that universe."
Dark Matter,"It was really good but towards the last season, it got too big and too weird time travel-ish. I really liked the cast."
Dark Matter,"Yeah, you're not alone. My reply is 2 days late, but hope this is just one of many to come in the next 10 years... At one point you'll be like, ""what even was that show? ""..."
Dark Matter,There are hundreds of us (at least). We had it trending on Twitter back in the day
Dark Matter,"I understand and agree with your feelings, but don't count this show out just yet.  The book was quite fantastic, I have no doubts the show will be as well."
Dark Matter,"The book is one of my all time favourites, give this one a shot."
Dark Matter,Read the book. It’s incredible.
Zoo,"One of my bigger fears in buying a home was that I was going to accidentally dig up a pet or something in the back yard. Anyway...

Good luck laying foundations, new zoo owner!"
Zoo,"The show had a sort of trainwreck fascination to it, but now that's over and I really don't care to hear from any of these people again."
Zoo,"> it can't be used for 'anything related to Tiger King'

I think that's good. that would be creepy"
Zoo,Is it ever gonna financially recover from this?
Zoo,Enter…the Lion King!
Zoo,"What's stopping the buyer from selling the property for more, and without that stipulation?"
Zoo,That show was a wild ride. Perfect way to start lockdown. Though I do feel bad that some people watched it as a documentary because it was definitely more entertainment than information.
Zoo,It's Oklahoma someone will probably buy it to grow weed on.
Zoo,Sometimes I forget that these are real people
Zoo,Imma start a new zoo called Lion Queen
Zoo,Wow he really never did financially recover from that.
Zoo,There goes my idea of a meth lab theme park
Zoo,Hey all you cool cats and kittens
Zoo,"Joe Exotic was far from a saint, and a genuinely crazy dangerous person.
Carol Baskin wants to do the right thing, but I personally find her insufferable."
Zoo,"That bitch! 

/s"
Zoo,He never did financially recover from it.
Zoo,"Damn, Joe was trying to ruin and literally kill Baskin but failed as miserably as anyone could. She now has a few documentaries under her belt, a nearly world famous name to the point that she can charge for appearances, oh and she is not in prison… none of that would have happened without Joe’s determination."
Zoo,I still think she did it
Zoo,my mom went to high school with Carole.  She said Carole was a stuck up bitch.
Zoo,That bitch carol baskin
Zoo,"Anyone else just waiting for the day, in the near future, when it turns out Baskin really did murder her husband and Joe Exotic was right the whole time?"
Zoo,"Carol Baskin seems to have had the last word. But I wonder if it's the last chapter of this bizarre, bizarre saga."
Zoo,Hear me out... Lion Prime Minister? Tiger Queen? Ocelot Empire? Any of these sounding good?  Agent Orangutan Orange?  No? I'll see myself out...
Zoo,*Liger Prince*
Zoo,">""When we sold the property in June, we required that it never be used as a zoo, or for anything related to Tiger King or anything like that,"" Baskin told Yahoo. 

But, could it be used as a place to house numerous big cats and other animals, which people could pay to look at on a tour and at which other people would agree to work for no pay, I mean volunteer to assist with the cats? I wouldn't call it a zoo, it would obviously be a sanctuary."
Zoo,That bitch Carole baskins
Zoo,Fuck Carole baskin
Zoo,That fucking bitch
Zoo,ITT: a massive PR campaign from Carol Baskins “volunteers”
Zoo,"""I told y'all that that fucking bitch, Carole Baskin, killed her husband.  You take a look in her sump pump and I guarantee you'll find that body.  Fucking bitch!"""
Zoo,He’ll never financially recover from this
Zoo,Carole fuckin’ Baskin this pandemic has been long
Zoo,These are all terrible people
Zoo,Can you really stop it from being used a certain way if you sold it? 🤔
Zoo,Does this mean she is also shutting down her own tiger prison? Or just shutting down the competition?
Zoo,“Do you see a sign on the garage that says ‘dead husband storage?’ “
Zoo,Hey its that woman who murdered her husband
Zoo,There was really never a good reason to think she did anything to kill her husband.  I think the worst she did was possibly fucking with his will afterwards.  (AFTERwards)
Zoo,Think of all of the bodies she could bury there if she kept that place!
Zoo,That bitch!
Zoo,"Tiger king was a fascinating documentary about a cast of disgusting people.  


And Baskin was one of them."
Zoo,Don’t love her tbh
Zoo,They forgot “That fuckin bitch” in the title.
Zoo,Wow I love Carol Baskin now
Zoo,"Gonna be honest I still have never seen Tiger King and at this point I really don’t care about who, what, where about anything related to it."
Zoo,Fuck that bitch
Zoo,Good for her!
Zoo,"Carole Baskin!

Killed her husband! 

Wacked him!

Can't convince me. That it didn't happen!

Carole Baskin!"
Zoo,"The outright hatred for Baskin is insane. She’s done nothing wrong. She runs a charity and lobbies against animal abuse. She’s literally one of the only people on the show who’s not a monster. But because she’s a bit weird and annoying, suddenly she’s evil and malicious, whilst the murderers and rapists are super nice guys."
Zoo,Have they found her husband yet?
Zoo,I wonder where her husband is
Zoo,What a bitch.
Zoo,Killer husband wack’d him
Zoo,Who cares tbh
Zoo,"That bitch, Carole Baskins"
Zoo,"Carole baskins killed her husband, wacked him, she fed him to tigers they snackin ….what’s happenin? …. Carole Baskins… 😭🤣"
Zoo,"I actually don’t think anyone will believe this but I’m gonna tell it anyway, my cousin was involved in a documentary that’s being filmed that involves the murder of carol baskins husband, now as for who is right and wrong in this entire Tiger king thing is pretty cut and dry, joe is bad, those other animal exhibitionist are also bad, and quite possibly carol baskins is bad. So there are no real winners here with all these people in my opinion. But my cousin actually knew Carol’s husband, and she was staying with her boyfriend at the husbands home in..Costa rica I believe. Anyways she said that Carol’s husband was planning on divorcing her and relocating full time to Costa Rica. She said things definitely were not good between carol and the husband. She doesn’t know if Carol had anything to do with his death, but she left her boyfriend at the time and he also went missing the same time Carols husband did, he was a German citizen I believe. Anyways. Keep a look out for a new joe exotic/carol baskins doc and remember you read some random guy dropping some info at random. Small world."
Zoo,"While Joe Exotic is scum, this woman is a grade A cunt."
Zoo,She is such a nutter.
Zoo,What a bitch
Zoo,The Last Witch Alive
Zoo,Fukkin bitch
Zoo,She should still be investigated about her dead husband.
Zoo,That bitch Carol Baskin
Zoo,She wants to limit her competition who can raise and profit from wild cats and big animals.
Zoo,"She sucks. 

Edit: Carol and her husband are on here down voting all the shitpost about her lmao. No one likes you girl."
Zoo,Maybe for a place to bury her dead husband she murdered?
Zoo,I’d buy it and excavate the land to find her husbands dead body and then film a murder mystery show
Zoo,This bitch
Zoo,So…. Did she kill her husband and feed him to tigers? I gotta know.
Zoo,She should be in jail too.
Zoo,Fuck Carol Baskin
Zoo,Forgot all about this Baskin case!
Zoo,Prolly doesn’t want anyone digging up the property where she buried the bones of her dead husband.
Zoo,Fuck this thunder cunt
Zoo,That bitch
Zoo,That bitch
Zoo,CB is a b
Zoo,# Carole Fuggin' Baskin!
Zoo,Fucking Carol Baskin.
Zoo,That Bitch
Zoo,Do you think she is anti vaxx… she look anti vaxx
Zoo,Why is this cat criminal not in jail? Shes just as bad as Joe! Is she suggesting she can’t be caged in there? Sounds like a milk crate challenge to me.
Zoo,Carole baskin….Killed her. Husband. Whacked him.
Zoo,[removed]
Zoo,I love how Carol has been trying really hard to position herself as the hero in this incredibly sordid affair. She really is the worst lol
Zoo,#Fuckcarolebaskin
Zoo,That bitch!
Zoo,Killed her husband. Pass it on
Zoo,"Killed her husband, whacked him."
Zoo,Of course don't think about the consequences to your actions.
Zoo,This lady gives me the creeps.
Zoo,That fuckin' bitch Carole fuckin' Baskin!
Zoo,Carole FUCKING Baskins!
Zoo,That Bitch!
Zoo,Carole Baskin? The murderer?
Zoo,Killed her husband... wacked him.
Zoo,Hilary Clinton’s cousin for sure
Zoo,Yew beeetch
Zoo,Cuz she's a right murdering cunt bag
How to Get Away with Murder,"Even in the end you never saw her coming. You never knew what side she was fully on. Each step was so calculated, and she was the conductor of an orchestra and made beautiful music."
How to Get Away with Murder,">	comes off as a hero 

She was a villain, certainly not an anti-hero.  Great acting and great writing.  but not anywhere near a hero.  same for Walter White."
How to Get Away with Murder,And played by one of the greatest actresses too. The show became a mess but I kept coming back for Viola / Annalise.
How to Get Away with Murder,She is legit one of the worst characters ever put to screen. There’s just too much wrong about this show and this character. Completely unredeemable and unlikable.
How to Get Away with Murder,[deleted]
How to Get Away with Murder,"You can’t possibly watch the show and believe she was strictly a villain who possessed evil intentions all the time. 

Annalise displayed heroic methods by trying to save Laurel’s premature baby, defending those who are oppressed by the court system regarding their race multiple times and not to mention putting her life on the line for the K5 often when all went wrong.

She also displays villainous moments like the situation with Rebecca, times she tampered with evidence and framed others which benefited in saving in the K5 and herself.

Like I said, there’s definitely a big case to be made for her to qualify for a hero, villain and anti-hero but she definitely isn’t strictly a villain."
How to Get Away with Murder,It got deleted because I didn’t include the name of the show I was referring to in the title. But i’m surprised anyone remembers.
How to Get Away with Murder,A true chaotic neutral.
How to Get Away with Murder,"using the but Hitler also built the autobahn defense does not make her any less of a villain. 

a villain doesn’t have to have evil intentions all the time.

characters are judged by the totality of their actions and that puts her in the villain camp."
How to Get Away with Murder,"You went from a fictional character to a real life war criminal, what?"
How to Get Away with Murder,"it’s called an analogy.  pointing out nice things a villain has done does not absolve them of being a villain.  once you crossed the line, you crossed the line."
How to Get Away with Murder,Ok that got a laugh out of me. I might check this show out
How to Get Away with Murder,One of the best breakout/secondary characters.
How to Get Away with Murder,"I'm halfway through season 2 and Sandra is the absolute best character on the show, right up there with Dina. The fact that she has a photographic memory and can never forget one hellish moment of working there is funnier than it has any right to be."
How to Get Away with Murder,"God I fucking love Sandra. I think my favourite line from her is the really quiet “if it helps, I’m a trained midwife”"
How to Get Away with Murder,Sandra v Carole one of the best blood feuds on tv.
How to Get Away with Murder,"One of my favorite moments in the show is during Sandra’s wedding when it cuts to her and Jerry singing a wholesome version of Creep by Radiohead lmao

“You’re my weirdo

I’m so happy that you’re here

We both belong here.”"
How to Get Away with Murder,"AQUASOCKS, AMY! ******* AQUASOCKS"
How to Get Away with Murder,She was a manicurist in an episode of Modern Family. She is my all-time favorite character on Superstore.
How to Get Away with Murder,"On a B99 rewatch I noticed she was an extra on the episode ""Ava""

Love this actress, hope we see more of her now that superstore is over."
How to Get Away with Murder,Sandra is so good in this show. This show is so underrated. It’s so funny.
How to Get Away with Murder,Sandra is one of the best characters on the show. My favorite scene with her is one of the morning meetings where she admits to having two lunches; a decoy lunch in case Carol does something to it and her real lunch. The look of horror on Sandra's face when Carol screams ' I know about your second lunch Sandra!' is hysterical.
How to Get Away with Murder,Shut up Sandra
How to Get Away with Murder,Jesus...
How to Get Away with Murder,"Good to see that every comedy now employs the conference room meeting as a way to pack in a lot of jokes

The Office was the first. Then Parks and Rec. B99 does it a lot. I guess Superstore does it too."
How to Get Away with Murder,....why are there so many overweight people on this show?
How to Get Away with Murder,it just ended at 6 seasons
How to Get Away with Murder,"Please do, it was such a treat.  Especially if you've ever worked in retail or the service industry."
How to Get Away with Murder,"It’s a very clever show, helped lift my kid out of depression"
How to Get Away with Murder,Just ended; I found it well rounded
How to Get Away with Murder,"This show is straight gold and had the perfect ending. I for sure wasn’t crying at the end... I was. If you do end up watching it, pay attention to the random B reel in between scenes, some of the funniest stuff."
How to Get Away with Murder,"I just started watching it last week, did not expect to enjoy it this much. I thought it would be like a Chuck Lorre type sitcom but its actually pretty funny and dark at times. Sandra is my favourite."
How to Get Away with Murder,"Honestly man I loved it, was unsure for a couple episodes but it became my most binged show. If you like stuff like the office or parks and rec then this is up your street."
How to Get Away with Murder,I love the she and Jerry are juggaloes XD
How to Get Away with Murder,Because in the episode with Brett's funeral we found out it's the only song she knows how to play!
How to Get Away with Murder,[Best love story since Twilight](https://youtu.be/JXdjqTtjAt8) :P
How to Get Away with Murder,The song she comes down the aisle to is the Hamster Dance.
How to Get Away with Murder,"I loved Sandra being the resident ""shipper on deck"" for Jonah and Amy lmao"
How to Get Away with Murder,She was also in Parks and Rec as the Mongolian woman get the international award. She was really great as the rub and tug masseuse in Legit.
How to Get Away with Murder,Underrated? The first season was shaky but seasons 2-5 all have 100% ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and the show was nominated for several awards. Seems rated very well.
How to Get Away with Murder,"I always hated shows like The Walking Dead which was just a bunch of 1 on 1 private conversations.

Other group members talking about or simply reacting to B or C story lines are a good thing.

Besides all those places DO have meetings so it’s not really feeling forced."
How to Get Away with Murder,Representative of America!
How to Get Away with Murder,Being overweight in America is strongly correlated to being in a lower socioeconomic class. It's a show about people working at a Walmart-like superstore. It pretty accurately depicts the amount of obese people you would find employed at these places.
How to Get Away with Murder,"There hasn’t even been a fat joke on this show.

What are you talking about?"
How to Get Away with Murder,And it was such a great ending
How to Get Away with Murder,It was oddly therapeutic
How to Get Away with Murder,"Hey haven’t finished yet (Season 4)

What do you think of Garett and Jonah so far?

Garett has the most hilarious delivery.

Jonah is basically Reddit embodied.

They are such slept on funny characters!"
How to Get Away with Murder,I love that she lost jerry in a bet and both of them went along with it like “what are we gonna do?”
How to Get Away with Murder,I wish Jerry had more screen time with Sandra
How to Get Away with Murder,Sandra herself would super disagree. We all know what relationship she was really invested in
How to Get Away with Murder,"Well yeah every workplace has meetings. 

Part of the joke from The Office was the commentary on office culture. Not just the 
meetings being used as a device to tell jokes.

These other shows are just using conference room meetings as a device to gather characters together."
How to Get Away with Murder,The customers in the background
How to Get Away with Murder,"I'm up to Season 3, but so far Garrett is fantastic but Jonah just seems like a weak character, not really sure what to make of him.  It's the supporting cast that makes it work for me not so much Jonah/Amy and their will they/won't they thing."
How to Get Away with Murder,And the fact that she didn't consider a best 2/3!!
How to Get Away with Murder,"He does have [anger problems](https://youtu.be/PmNS-LLIukk?t=83), so I'm not surprised :P"
How to Get Away with Murder,"This is an interesting observation and maybe you’re onto something.

The office started a satire but abandoned that fairly quickly and became something different.

If B99 was grounded in any way it would be so much better. But it’s waay silly from the jump.

Parks and Rec makes fun of how incompetent local Government can be but takes it to 11

Walmart is exactly as portrayed by Superstore. It’s not exaggerating customers or employees.

 It doesn’t jump the shark. It hits the mark.

It arguably uses **meetings** more naturally than the others imo.

But your right, it’s been done before.

Though your connection of its similarities was fun to think about and maybe the influence other shows had, reflecting on post office shows was very interesting to think about, I like your comment."
How to Get Away with Murder,"I feel ya. I think one of the strengths of the show is that the “Will They Or Won’t They” is more in the background and not front and center.

And in the episodes that it is the B and C plots are so funny that they might as well be A. It’s a good balance, hope you enjoy as much as I did.

It’s a fun show, sucks it’s only getting “water cooler talk” after it’s ended."
How to Get Away with Murder,I loved it. If you like dramatic unrealistic soapy shows then yes. If you’re looking for a real depiction of law school I’d look elsewhere lol
How to Get Away with Murder,"Too late OJ

sorry Juice"
How to Get Away with Murder,stick to just the first season
How to Get Away with Murder,No
How to Get Away with Murder,Do u have any recommendations for shows that show a true depiction of law school?
How to Get Away with Murder,"i only watched the first season and thought it was good, lost interest in s2 tho"
How to Get Away with Murder,"I just started it. Completely ridiculous show with shoddy writing at best, but I’m watching it anyway."
How to Get Away with Murder,*The Paper Chase*
How to Get Away with Murder,I think the movie Legally Blonde is probably more accurate than How to Get Away with Murder. This is relative.
How to Get Away with Murder,"Thank god. I do like the show, but season 1 was the only one I felt like had a story to be told. Hope it's a good one the sixth."
How to Get Away with Murder,"This is a good thing, will miss the show but it should have ended a while ago."
How to Get Away with Murder,Maybe they need to call the last season “Oscar Winner Viola Davis in ‘How To Get Away With Fulfilling Contractual Obligations”
How to Get Away with Murder,"this show is just like prison break. season 1 was so good.

but this type of show, if you don't already plan ahead what's gonna happen in these later seasons (or even season 2 really) - you just get yourself written into a corner and whatever they try to do doesn't make any sense and is obviously tacked on, on a whim."
How to Get Away with Murder,"Finally. This show has been pretty rough the last 2-3 seasons. You can really tell the writers have just completely run out of ideas, which makes sense, because a series with this kind of concept has no point lasting 6 years. I honestly felt it should have been a one-season miniseries and left it at that, but being a network show, of course they have to drag it out until it's a shell of what it once was, and everyone hates it."
How to Get Away with Murder,"""And that, is how you get away with murder""

*roll credits*"
How to Get Away with Murder,"For someone who couldn’t be arsed to watch past season 2, did they get away with it?"
How to Get Away with Murder,Show has been sucking ass since S2 anyway
How to Get Away with Murder,"I stopped watching when they killed Wes in whichever season that was. It needed to be over, I hope they all go to jail in the end. I do love Viola though."
How to Get Away with Murder,Unlike you unfaithful hoes I would've watched till season 10 and the some VIVA LA VIOLA VIVA LA ANNALISE
How to Get Away with Murder,This is good. I was beginning to hate everyone on the show including Annalise herself but I will be sad to see it go. I do think it’s the right time though.
How to Get Away with Murder,"Good. Don’t get me wrong, my wife and I will continue to watch it, but none of these characters do anything for me. It’d been more interesting if they’d had Thanos snap them all, starting with Annalise."
How to Get Away with Murder,"Am glad to be honest. I like the show but it also doesn't need more seasons, hope it ends on a good note."
How to Get Away with Murder,The Orville. Stop with the Kelly/Ed shit already.
How to Get Away with Murder,I’ve always felt like the writers thought that killing Wes was going to breathe new life into the show but all it did was sink it. And I wasn’t even a Wes fan.
How to Get Away with Murder,That first season was great. It has just gotten way over the top now. It's past time for it to end. I hope the final season can rekindle that spark of the first season with a solid mystery but its so far gone now that I doubt it will be any good then the last few seasons we had
How to Get Away with Murder,"It's already been around for 5 seasons? I've never watched, but remember seeing promos for the series premiere. It doesn't feel like it's been 5 years. 

Fuckin' A."
How to Get Away with Murder,"That's six seasons too late.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adx4of7Pnvo"
How to Get Away with Murder,6 seasons too many.
How to Get Away with Murder,"Unlike the edge lords (who eagerly gobbled every minute of this and then acted like they didn't enjoy it at the time) I'll say this program is very well crafted and serves its purpose with twists and time shifts and flashback surprises.  And it has done so throughout its run up to current.  

The complaints are people who ate three delicious pizzas and two delicious cakes now trying to claim those pizzas and cakes weren't delicious at the time.  But they were. 

There's a trend that it's Reddit-cool to shit on anything good and to try and be the earliest shitter.   Make sure and say Game Of Thrones - that people loved to their core - is crap.  Sopranos and The Simpsons apparently all should have ended season one.  Every episode of every show past the pilot has ""jumped the shark""."
How to Get Away with Murder,"I really loved the first season of the show, but it got worse every year... season 2 was still pretty great. Season 3 less so, but still thrilling in its own right. Season 4 was terrible and season 5 was almost unwatchable for me. I dont think i can take more than another season of it tbh so this news isnt disappointing to me. I dont have high hopes at this point but i too hope it's a good season. I want them to take the show back to its roots of a simple murder mystery before they started with all the convoluted political conspiracy stuff."
How to Get Away with Murder,"It was almost like they didnt expect to make it past 1 season, and have had no clue what to do since."
How to Get Away with Murder,But in fact subsequent seasons did rely on and expand on deliciously planted clues from prior seasons and did tell amazing stories.
How to Get Away with Murder,"This will shock the complainers, but there's an obscure law which says you're allowed to stop watching a show you hate."
How to Get Away with Murder,"She never phones in it though. 

You can say a lot about the writing, but her acting is always top tier"
How to Get Away with Murder,"IIRC, the writers said they just come up with things on the fly and dont plan ahead."
How to Get Away with Murder,Actually a really great comparison. The later seasons of both shows are ridiculously stupid and clearly not planned.
How to Get Away with Murder,"I could even see it being an AHS-style show where every season is a new concept with different characters, but I would be flummoxed on how to draw this type of show out 6 seasons."
How to Get Away with Murder,Just kinda kept murdering people. As you do.
How to Get Away with Murder,They broke out of prison and then went back for some reason iirc.
How to Get Away with Murder,Nah I’m a die hard but shit ran out of juice about two seasons ago. I’m glad they’r ending now before further damage is done now let’s just hope Bony or Laurel or both die🙃.
How to Get Away with Murder,">There's a trend that it's Reddit-cool to shit on anything good 

but this show is NOT good and thats why people shit on it lol, season 1 was great, season 2 was good and its been on a steady decline since then"
How to Get Away with Murder,"I agree there is a lot of people in this sub that talk like every TV should only have one season, I don't think HTGAWM should be a one season show but they really didn't plan the show forward. A lot of the characters feel under developed and under used and it's been really repetitive as of late with Laurel's father being behind everything twice."
How to Get Away with Murder,"Its ""roots"" were not a ""simple murder mystery"".  First season contained a rather non-simple and non-single murder arc. We even know outcome but get drawn into figuring out the mysteries of how it transpired.  It's powerful and engaging storytelling.

And early seasons also included ""case of the week"" B stories in which clients would come in from the sidelines and the Professor would work with the students to handle and close them like a procedural while the season long arcs would also be furthered.  That's the true ""roots"".

The case-of-the-week element and the use of classroom vignettes to introduce and conclude B stories has gone away."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Cranston:

>”I love that show. To me, it was the comedic flip side to Breaking Bad because of the quality of the writing. Linwood Boomer is really considering it. And he said — just like [Breaking Bad creator] Vince Gilligan would say — if there was a great idea that everybody got excited about, he would really consider doing it. And we're all onboard. All the actors said, Well, we'd love to see each other again, for those very same reasons.”


>”But I, too, want it to be a good reason. I don't need a job. I don't want to just be busy. But I love to work, and I would love to reunite with that cast and that crew, and tell those stories in that character again. To be able to slip into Hal again, at this age, all those years ago, [would be] phenomenal.... I'm thrilled at the prospect of it."""
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Please god give us another roller skating episode.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Give me a reunion episode with Malcolm running for President
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Wow even Erik Per Sullivan? Last I heard about him Frankie Muniz was saying he wasn't interested in a potential revival. Don't do it if ya can't get everyone.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"The thought of seeing Jane Kaczmarek back in that role is what really makes me happy about this. A few actors have dominated Emmys for their sitcom roles and justifiably so: Don Knotts, John Laroquette, and Jane Kaczmarek."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"As long as it's not like The Bradys 1990 revival, which featured Peter as a NASCAR driver who was paralyzed after a crash."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I want the original actors to carry on playing the parents and three young school-aged kids and acting like everything is normal.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"""Are you thrilled at the prospect of a reunion?""  

""Sure""

""BRIAN CRANSTON IS THRILLED"""
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Even Dewey?  Didn't his actor like disappear?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Life is unf^a^i^r
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Fun fact: Frankie Muniz and Phoebe Waller-Bridge are the same age, which makes Malcolm & Fleabag fourth-wall breaking contemporaries."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I remember Malcolm played a computer simulation where his life went to shit while everyone else did ok, it would be funny if part of their back story from the last 20 years played off that"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I hope Malcolm really does become President and Dewey became like an Elon Musk level eccentric billionaire. And Reese is still the janitor at the same high school.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I demand at least one like where Hal mentions his dream where he was a meth cook
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I really hope Reese is a crypto millionaire….
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Love that show!  It’s up there with 30 rock, parks n rec, cheers, mash, taxi."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Surprised to hear that Erik Sullivan is game to join them. Seemed he ran away from acting after the show ended.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I don't get excited for these kind of things anymore, alot of shows have been ruined but this I can get behind."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"With all the stuff going on with his brother, would Christopher Matherson be involved? I believe he's a Scientologist as well."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Would love to see Grandpa Hal. The connors came back on a regular basis, would be dope if they can do something similar for this show"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I don’t think it needs a series, just do a movie"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Didnt like all the boys quit acting years ago?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Theyve been saying this pretty much every year since I rewatched it 10 years ago
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Personally I think I'd prefer a Friends-style reunion instead of some painfully unfunny special that absolutely fails to build on or even capture the original show.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Malcolm in the middle reunion or the breaking bad prequel that fills in the missing years between them? 😁
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Why?  It's just going to turn into, ""Hey man, wouldn;t it be cool if hal became walter?"" It's like people think breaking bad is the only show ever."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Somebody remind Frankie.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I loved that show!
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I’ll watch!
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"After starting breaking bad along with the clips associated with the show throughout the main parts of it, I immediately see why people believe in the conspiracy theories of Hal being Walter White and vice versa where he didn’t die: he just found ways to get out of a bad situation, you know like Jimmy AKA Saul."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"If he can go back to Hal from Walter White, I will be in absolute awe of those acting chops."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,This is basically the only show that I would watch in the morning tv here in Germany otherwise the tv is only on for console gaming.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I. Would. Really. Enjoy. This... I. Hope. They. Make. It.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Malcolm should be stuck in a soul crushing middle class job (teacher?), Reese is a successful scammy management consultant, or MLM founder. Dewey married a rich girl, might have a blue collar skilled trade job, or is a stay home dad & happy family. Francis has 6 kids from 3 mothers, and he's raising them all by himself."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,[He already did a bit as Hal not too long ago](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oVdB36lmbII)
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I don’t even care. His best role. I love that show.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"just do a MitM/BrBa crossover already.

that's what we're all salivating over"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Everybody loves Raymond style show with the Malcolm in the Middle Family.

I’m so fucking on board!"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I’m kinda over reunion specials. I want these show to take a page out of the Brady Bunch’s book and do a full on special episode. Imagine catching up with Malcolm and his family in the present time. The whole episode could be them returning for Lois and Hal’s vowel renewal.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,[deleted]
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"LOL, just imagine the director have Cranston's Hal go ""Walter White"" mode over a family tiff. 

""Lois, enough. Francis is gone. He had it coming after he ran off to Alaska and then sold us out to those Germans. No UK for Malcolm. I need to keep him in reach in case he starts to talk."""
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"If Hal doesn’t wale up saying he had an awful dream about becoming a drug lord, they’ll have missed a huge opportunity"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Will we find out what the anime from the intro is?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I thought the Malcolm character, I'm sorry his name escapes me right now, left acting for racing cars."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"And I just now realized that Cranston is both Hal and Walter. I'm not a big follower of media, but I feel like this is something I should have twigged to before. Grant me, I haven't watched breaking bad except for the first couple episodes when it first came out."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I don’t Need That. All of those reunions were bad. It can’t get any better than the original
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Surprised to hear Muniz is in, but money talks I guess..."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,doesnt Frankie Muniz have these memory-loss problems which made him unable to work in acting?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"They’re all going to get to the set but Frankie won’t be there. They’ll call Frankie and ask him where he is, and he’ll say he doesn’t remember Malcolm in the Middle."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Is it just going to be Frankie Muniz saying “who are these people? Where am I? What’s going on?” For 25 episodes lol??
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I'm not a praying man, but....."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I’m excited for this.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,who’s gonna play the baby?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I want this. Very badly.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Malcom is at least a senator by this point in life
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,YES BRO!!!
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Pretty sure Malcolm is a nascar driver now. Lol
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Fuck. Yes.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Frankie Muniz still looks the exact fuckin same lol
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,One of my favorite shows of all time
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,That’s the best news I have heard all night
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,We Want Adult Dewey!
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,All the yes
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,My favorite show of all time.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Be sure to subscribe to the hilarious stories from our podcast where we review the podcast that looked back on our podcast about the show.


**Idiocracy includes nostalgia.**"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,High key excited to see Frankie Muniz act again.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Hasn't the actor who played dewy fucking dropped off the grid?

I dont blame him. But would he be in it?"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I'd love to see Cranston do a comedic role like Hal again.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Reunion means one of those 'meeting to mix up with a documentary style content'? Or actual episodes? Cause I really want the second.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Oh my god this would be amazing. Malcolm in the Middle is genuinely one of the best sitcoms of all time, and definitely the most underrated imo. Every episode is a goldmine"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"it just needs a witty name, ""Malcom at the top, sorta"""
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,This was a classic back in my youth!
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,He better be cooking meth
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Malcolm is a racing driver now 😎
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I never got to see malcolm in the middle as a kid as it always finished airing just before I got home from school, and we only had 3 channels and no recorder so I could see it later. I always knew it was meant to be an amazing show but never saw any of it until a couple weeks ago when I started binging it. Its really good. And not a kids show at all. I can't believe what I missed out on."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Even Dewey?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I'm ready!
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Even Dewey?
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,A movie style episode with all the kids coming back and it’s chaos with their children would be pretty funny.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Ah, Chris Masterson - The good brother."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Giancarlo Esposito needs to cameo as the owner of a local Mexican restaurant that is nice to everyone expect Bryan Cranston and it’s never explained why.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Omgggg I binged the whole series a couple months ago and even jumped into the ""will they do a reunion show"" because I love it immensely."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"In the “Useless information “ column-

Malcom is racing at Daytona next weekend"
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I can never see Frankie Muniz the same after seeing his [sex scene in Extreme Movie](https://youtu.be/SWyF66BUH4k)
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Looks like all the shows of my childhood are coming back
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"The future is now, old man."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,It just boggles my mind how different Bryan looks with hair and a shaved face as opposed to bald and a goatee.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"He mentioned that they’re planning on releasing a movie, I really hope it’s happening instead of releasing a new season of the show."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Holy shit what a coincidence.  My wife and i are going through the series right now and Hal is far and away the best character.   His little screams of excitement/fear are hilarious coupled with the fact that Cranston seems to be down to do any and everything lmao.  Especially if it means he gets to be in his underwear.  I swear he negotiates underwear time in his contract.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,I heard Dewey got molested
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,YES! my childhood favorite non cartoon tv show
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"I loved that show and discovered it while unfortunately, going thru an awful depression. I watched every episode on repeat for quite awhile. I’d do it again. I’m fine now, this was years ago but, I’d be there for whatever they might do."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Walt’s life before.
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Malcom X in The Middle: By All Means Necessary
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Reece was caught selling Meth to the kids at school……it’s blue
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,is Dewey on board though
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"Malcolm has been living in a space utopia he and the other geniuses built. He touches on the old series finale by saying he's too smart to be president and there is no fixing the country. The show starts with his return to earth after being ousted for throwing a temper tantrum, even though he started the place. He spent all his billions on the utopia and is now broke.

Lois and Hal accepted some money from Malcolm (for repayment of years of home destruction) but were too proud to take anything more from him so they live in the same house and take him in. 

Reese has a Michelin Star food truck but gets in trouble for living in it and off the grid. He's sentenced to house arrest at his last known address - his parents address. The judge takes great pleasure in this.

Dewy has lived in the new mansion next door for years but none of his family know. Hal has had a fued with the mysterious neighbor the whole time. 

Francis is the president of a small, militant nation. He's just as surprised as anyone. 

Jamie and his little sibling (it ended on another pregnancy right?) are in both cadets at the Marlin Academy."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,Bryan Cranston really is an anomaly in Hollywood. He's very gracious and very kind. He never wants to stop playing his most known characters in Hal and Walter White. The way he talks is he'd play those characters forever no matter how bad the scripts are because he just loves playing them. Vast difference to many other actors who end their big TV show and are like thank god I never have to play this character again. And I do understand that perspective 100%. I just find Cranston's point of view of it so interesting and it just gives off intense gratitude for everyone who helped him be where he is today
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,"All the while reading that quote, I could see Hal in my head with all his mannerisms, his giddy optimism, saying all of this.  It's hard to choose my favorite character that Bryan Cranston has played because Hal and Walter are such juxtaposition characters, and he NAILS them both.  But it's not with those 2 either, he's just an all around GOOD actor.  Also, he's a decent dude if anything, his recent Hot Ones interview reenforces that."
Sinatra: All or Nothing at All,">  All the actors said, Well, we'd love to see each other again

except for malcolm, who is looking forward to working with them all for the first time (in his memory)

edit: I see from comments that my information is old.  thanks to those who helped me correct my misunderstanding."

Only Fools and Horses,The Dave channel - known for being pretty eccentric in general - was apparently named because everyone in Britain knows someone called Dave.
Only Fools and Horses,"Yeah Gold, named after Dave."

Only Fools and Horses,"I certainly remember the garage in the final episode, not the door specifically."
Only Fools and Horses,I had never heard of this show so I thought it meant that only 1 show in history had covered this thought experiment before WandaVision.
Only Fools and Horses,"[John dies in the end](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1783732/) did it as well...

Only Fools and Horses,It's been done [quite a few times](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ship_of_Theseus_examples) apparently.
Only Fools and Horses,Articles like this are straight trash.
Only Fools and Horses,"She's mortified that pre 2020 woke era tv had a few words and attitudes in it that didnt fit with her world view. Who would have thought it!?

Only Fools & Horses is the greatest British sitcom of all time."
Only Fools and Horses,It's almost as if removing the programme from it's original context exposes all the flaws of television from that era!
Only Fools and Horses,Imagine being mortified by all the racism and swearing in Deadwood. Trotters are/were low class London con men trash. And they were written as such.
Only Fools and Horses,Imagine writing something as fucking bland as this
Only Fools and Horses,"This is just another form of clickbait, it's like saying ""I fucking despise the Avengers"", no one hates the avengers, they're universally beloved films."
Only Fools and Horses,in 50 years we all look back in horror at the shows that are produced now
Only Fools and Horses,"I'm bored with the Avengers.

I don't hate them, I don't love then. I wouldn't say they're universally beloved."
Only Fools and Horses,"Rarely see it mentioned on here. It's a legendary show, almost perfect. There's a sub for it here on Reddit, though I haven't been on it in a long time. 


Some interesting stuff I've learned about it is that the reason David Jason was cast as Del is because he was a lot smaller than Nicholas Lyndhurst, and so there would never be a significant level of physical intimidation from Del to Rodney. 

Also, Cassandra was written as being much younger than she was seemingly portrayed. She was supposed to be very young, maybe sixteen when Rodney met her.


Something I love about this show is the weird characters that we rarely if ever see, and the racial and national stereotyping that would probably not fly at all these days. Paddy the Greek, Sunglasses Ron. As an Irishman I'm a big fan of Brendan, and how scared Rodney was of him, and then acting tough the second he's out of earshot. 

Boycey, Grandad, Albert, Slater, Trigger, and the long suffering Denzel were great characters. 

The card game with Boycey, getting pinched by Slater, the jolly boys outing, Albert falling down the cellar, the watch, the blow up dolls, Del's ""daughter"" going out with Rodney, painting Denzel's house. All great episodes off the top of my head. Last I checked there wasn't a lot of episodes on Netflix. Hopefully they'll sort all that out soon. You know it makes sense."
Only Fools and Horses,"It was a great show.  I still watch repeats of it.  While you know what is going to happen, it is still funny now.  Elements of it might not transfer well to America, like the Cockney rhyming slang, and references to British people and events, but we do understand those thing here in Ireland.  A classic comedy, no doubt.  One of the best since Fawlty Towers."
Only Fools and Horses,"I loved it. I'm an American who grew up watching British comedies on PBS. But someone suggested this to me around 2010, watched the whole thing laughing. Also because of David jason, I got into Open All Hours."
Only Fools and Horses,"One of the greatest, but I'm biased as I was pretty much raised on that and Black Adder"
Only Fools and Horses,Love it! The characters are so funny and down to earth. One of the best British TV shows around.
Only Fools and Horses,Perfick!
Only Fools and Horses,"The seven original series are an absolute masterclass of comedy writing. I've seen some of the specials, and they're definitely not bad - but do leave a little to be desired. I don't think I've ever tried the prequel series, I figured the ship had sailed by that point."
Only Fools and Horses,Definitely one of my top ten favourite comedies ever.
Only Fools and Horses,"Interesting fact, the show is hugely popular in the Balkans, and has been airing there for ages, but I thinks it's largely because the humor is very similar and the topics are close. I have spoken to a lot of other europeans, younger and older, and they've never heard of it. It is probably one of my favourite comedic shows of all time."
Only Fools and Horses,It is quite the wonderful series. David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst played so well against each other.
Only Fools and Horses,"Probably because it never aired here. While Monty Python started airing on PBS shortly after the show wrapped in 1974. It was also airing in truncated form on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment in 1975. Plus it was a staple of the early era of MTV. Then it was later on A&E, Comedy Central & BBC America. It was pretty much always on somewhere for a solid 30 year clip. I don't recall Only Fools and Horses ever being on even BBC America. 

That didn't stop the US from wanting to remake it though. They've been trying to make an American version for years. Different versions including one with Harry Morgan as Grandad with him being the main character, Steve Carrell  said he'd like to play Del Boy while he was still on The Office & they actually shot a pilot in 2012 with John Leguizamo as Del Boy plus Christopher Lloyd as Grandad. "
Only Fools and Horses,"I think because it just never caught on and the humor isn't as universal.  I only just recently started watching it and with Monty Python the humor is more universal and it doesn't mention a lot of British culture.  

I'd never heard of the show until a co-worker found out I like British shows and he gave me the DVD's.  I've only seen the first few episodes but they're pretty funny, albeit, predictable.

The one about the briefcases was absolutely hilarious though."
Only Fools and Horses,"In Portugal, it never aired, at least to my knowledge. It did get a portuguese remake though, named *O Fura-Vidas,* which is well regarded and remembered fondly by most people who watched it when it was on, and which had a stellar main cast."
Only Fools and Horses,"Monty Python was shown on TV in America quite a bit from the '70s to the present (as was Fawlty Towers). Only Fools and Horses wasn't. It's that simple.

Same story with The Young Ones. A lot of Americans love that show because MTV used to air it often in the '80s."
Only Fools and Horses,"Strange, as a Brit I never used to watch Only Fools And Horses. Just never did. Loved a lot of the other BBC comedy at the time - Blackadder, Red Dwarf, Bottom and Young Ones, but never thought Only Fools... could be that funny.

Thankfully my wife bought the entire box set and we've just gone through the first two series. Quite enjoyed it so far. "
Only Fools and Horses,"As a Yank where (growing up) my access to BBC shows was what was rebroadcast on PBS, I'd never heard of it - but my British friends swear by it. They tell me it's slow going at first but introduces the audience to the characters for much ensuing hilarity later on. I have a copy of the show they've given me and haven't watched it yet, but am looking forward to it. "
Only Fools and Horses,One of my all time favourite shows. Although I was born in Scotland so I’ve been raised on stuff like this. Christmas feels incomplete in my house if I haven’t watched the Christmas trilogy. 
Only Fools and Horses,"As an American, I think it's just too English. Personally, I love Monty Python, Blackadder, and even Jeeves and Wooster, but I can't stand Only Fools and Horses."
Only Fools and Horses,"I watched the first two episodes about 10 years ago and it wasn't that funny. I watched a couple of episodes of a later season last year because of people on reddit talking about it and they were much better. Most people only give a show a few episodes before moving on. 

Some older English comedies don't translate well for me. Men Behaving Badly was very popular there and it is not funny at all to me. I tried it multiple times. "
Only Fools and Horses,Because I've never heard of it. 
Only Fools and Horses,We've never seen it.
Only Fools and Horses,Yeah here in the Balkans we consider it as a definite proof that us and working class Brits are related
Only Fools and Horses,That's true. I'm Croatian. It's one of the most popular sitcoms here. I would say the most popular alongside Seinfeld.
Only Fools and Horses,"It's not just a TV show here, it's considered to be separate branch of philosophy "
Only Fools and Horses,One problem is that there is a lot of very British slang in the show; it would be very difficult for an American to understand it.
Only Fools and Horses,I'd have said the Monty Python stuff was less universal
Only Fools and Horses,"The early episodes of every classic comedy is generally a bit sketchy until they find their footing. It really gets going by series 2 and 3. Stick with it.

Just wait until you get to the chandelier episode! "
Only Fools and Horses,True. And one of our public channels aired Britcoms during several years regularly. All the classics. I loved watching Allo Allo and Faulty Towers. 
Only Fools and Horses,That is strange. Seems like you are enjoying it now though. The wonderful thing about Only Fools is that the humour hasn't aged. The jokes still feel very fresh...you can't really say the same about those other shows.
Only Fools and Horses,Do yourself a favour and just watch it. Best UK comedy every made. UK humour down to a tee.
Only Fools and Horses,I just think it's not that funny. It was pretty good towards the end but the classic scenes are just not that funny
Only Fools and Horses,Men Behaving Badly is not even in the same ballpark as Only Fools
Only Fools and Horses,Give it a watch then. It's on Netflix.
Only Fools and Horses,I can't think of anything that would be a problem. It's either unimportant or you can work it out from context
Only Fools and Horses,The Batman and Robin one is probably the hardest I've ever laughed when I first watched it.
Only Fools and Horses,"That bloody chandelier! I could see it coming, but it was still hilarious. The setup for the gag was agonisingly good. "
Only Fools and Horses,o.O that's what my co-worker said too.  Bob?
Only Fools and Horses,"I'm not arguing that they are on the same level.  Both were on online lists of top British comedies though. 

That's all I had to go by 10-12 years ago. 

From what I can tell both of these programs depend on cultural familiarity for humor. I'm sure I'm missing most of the humor in both shows. That's why I brought up Men Behaving Badly. 

In my opinion this is a big reason why  Only Fools and Horses isn't very popular in the US. 

Im sure that there are US shows that don't translate well either. 
"
Only Fools and Horses,Well it's not here in Turkey. 
Only Fools and Horses,As an american i had trouble understanding the British Office
Only Fools and Horses,"That's part of its enduring appeal, the long set ups, the inevitable gags you know are coming but still get you right in the laughs. "
Only Fools and Horses,It's on YouTube
Only Fools and Horses,What did you have trouble with?
Only Fools and Horses,These guys claiming to see every joke coming like a pair of comedy experts. 
Only Fools and Horses,"No need to be so snarky, they're just offering their view on it, not even a controversial one at that."
Only Fools and Horses,Yeah I just don't think I would count the show as predictable. The jokes come thick and fast.
Only Fools and Horses,"A show isn't just about the actors and the script. Many need you to be able to relate to the clothes, location and cultural recognition.

A lot of the humor would be lost if it were three Americans in a New York apartment.

Also, English humour is subtle sometimes and the laughs come from the viewer ""getting"" the joke based on a feeling of nostalgia/recognition.

Also, some things don't translate as well as they could, especially humour.

I live in Spain, and similarly I don't ""get"" some comedies which the locals find hilarious."
Only Fools and Horses,"It's not a unique phenomenon. Seinfeld was a critical and commercial success in the US, but never really made any impact over here. It can be down to a number of things really - cultural differences is the most likely, but it could even be something as trivial as the network that initially picked it up not promoting it effectively, meaning it never took off while it had the chance."
Only Fools and Horses,"It's relatively known in Malta.

I'd say most people who know anything about the UK would have seen that show."
Only Fools and Horses,"One thing that always surprised me about OFAH was how Del could make all these French jokes which most of my Irish and British friends and family understood. None of my American family members (apart from one brother who also speaks French) would ever know that 'oui oui mangetout' was a joke. I wouldn't call the humor high brow, but there are definitely aspects that can be lost on some viewers."
Only Fools and Horses,"Australian here. I'm a huge fan of British comedy. I love Blackadder, Red Dwarf, Flying Circus, Fawlty Towers, Black Books, Father Ted, IT Crowd, Mighty Boosh, Young Ones and many more that I can't remember right now.

I've never seen Only Fools and Horses. I've heard of it, I know how popular it is. I even know people who are fans. I just don't think it was widely available here."
Only Fools and Horses,"It was popular, my dad was in it and received royalties from over ninety countries.

Countries you wouldn't expect loved it"
Only Fools and Horses,"I know Only Fools and Horses aired on at least one local PBS affiliate for a while.

I'm sure that this show, along with a huge number of other Britcoms, weren't pick up in other countries because the humor is so particularly British, and just isn't funny enough to non-British audiences, the way there are some American shows that aren't popular outside the U.S. because they're just so *American*. Granted that's not the best example, but it's not super ridiculous that the people in charge of licensing tv shows would think a show like Only Fools and Horses is just not something most people outside of its home country would be super into watching. "
Only Fools and Horses,"Sometimes, especially if there's a lot of slang, the British comedies are  hard to decipher. I had to translate a lot of AbFab for a friend. Torchwood, with the Welsh accent was torturous. Could this be it?"
Only Fools and Horses,I'm guessing it wasn't one of the shows PBS purchased back in the 70s and 80s. That's why Americans don't know it. Dunno about those other countries.
Only Fools and Horses,"A Portuguese version was produced and it was very popular. I've never watched the original version, but I'm sure it's as good as the show we got, if not better."
Only Fools and Horses,MUĆKE
Only Fools and Horses,"I'm an American and I have seen and liked lots of UK comedies, I watched the first few episodes of Only Fools and Horses and I didn't find it very funny. 

Some of your highly rated comedies weren't very funny to me. Only Fools and Horses, The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, Men Behaving Badly are all shows that were highly rated that fell flat for me. 

I was a member of a UK expat torrent site for years so I've seen lots of UK shows and liked a good percentage of them. "
Only Fools and Horses,US here. Never heard of it. I like Britcoms so I'll look for it.
Only Fools and Horses,"I don't understand how Keeping Up Appearances can be popular. If they spoke with an American accent, that show would have been cancelled after 6 episodes."
Only Fools and Horses,Because only fools and horses care
Only Fools and Horses,Because 1. It's a British sitcom and 2. It has to compete with a long list of already popular sitcoms in the US. I don't know why that's difficult to understand.
Only Fools and Horses,It's rubbish
Only Fools and Horses,It was really popular here in Croatia.
Only Fools and Horses,Which part did your dad play? :) 
Only Fools and Horses,"What role did your Dad have? 
"
Only Fools and Horses,"There are quite a few pieces of slang in OFAH, yes.

Weird that you had to translate a lot of Torchwood, though. I didn't think the Welsh accent was too heavy."
Only Fools and Horses,"OFAH doesn't really get good until halfway through Series 2 (A Touch of Glass). Up until that point, it is still trying to find its feet. "
Only Fools and Horses,"Because no matter where in the world you live, chances are you know a Hyacinth. I think the relatability made it so awesome. 

It's also hilariously British, but at the same time it doesn't rely on cultural stereotypes to a point where it would be incomprehensible to non-Brits . It's just a lighthearted comedy about an annoying old woman. Everbody can enjoy that.

The series would never work if it was American, simply because that kind of show format doesn't exist in the US. "
Only Fools and Horses,"I don't get it either.

I am living in Sweden right now. People are constantly asking me ""Do you like Keeping up Appearances?""

I can't say I have watched many episodes.

Blackadder isn't broadcast here either, nor Fawlty Towers. It makes no sense. The lesser-comedies are being broadcast, but not the decent stuff."
Only Fools and Horses,"I also don't get it. I saw one episode (it was something about her keeping a delivery truck outside her house so people would think she had ordered something expensive, I think) and couldn't understand how they milked 30 minutes of programming out of the storyline (*nothing else happened in the episode*; like, other shows would have a secondary plot going on that's unrelated to that one), and then I find out the entire show is basically the same ""woman does something to make neighbors think she's more well-off than she is"" premise. The only thing I like about that show is the main female character reminds me of Julia Child for some reason."
Only Fools and Horses,"I am not talking about just in the US.

There are plenty of lesser sitcoms (Keeping up Appearances etc.) which have made it big in mainland Europe, but OFAH never did."
Only Fools and Horses,Yeah. But it really isn't.
Only Fools and Horses,"Probably since we can relate to characters pretty well and UK shows are common on our national TV. 

Translation of the title is excellent too, some shows get almost zero chance to be successful with bad title translation."
Only Fools and Horses,Slovenia too. They still have re-runs from time to time.
