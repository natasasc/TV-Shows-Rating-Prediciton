Wolf Girl and Black Prince,I hated this character right up until this very scene and then I was blown away by this performance. The writing and directing just added to how good it is. I think it's got to be up there with some of the best stuff we've seen in Star Trek.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Man, did they replace the entire writing team or something? The difference between this season and the first two is night and day.

For a while now, I've thought it was kind of weird for Michael Chabon of all people to be involved with this show. I've enjoyed several of his novels, and he does have numerous writing credits on other projects, but it always seemed like an odd fit to me. Did he approach them or did they approach him?

My personal theory is that, as a veteran writer and screenwriter, Michael Chabon was there specifically to take everyone else's spontaneous and somewhat conflicting ideas and somehow help develop that hodge-podge amalgamation into something that made sense. Which sounds like a miserable nightmare. The show had ""too many cooks"" written all over it."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"The actor playing shaw is really good.

They can definitely do a series with shaw and seven continuing the journey on the titan"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Star Trek: Picard is a true successor to TNG in the sense that we had to wait until season 3 for it to get really good.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Could somebody please, **please** buy the production a f-ing light-bulb? Is that part of the legally-mandated-percent-difference in a contract somewhere? Are they trying to hide terrible sets?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Shaw is the most understandable asshole I've seen on television in awhile. He's been right every step of the way while Picard and Riker kept fucking up. The first two seasons of Picard are unwatchable* trash, but this one has been surprisingly good."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"“I’m sorry I tried to kill you, I was possessed by an evil alien entity at the time” is such a common apology in Star Trek there’s probably a section at Hallmark. No one is blaming Keiko O’Brien for trying to murder the Prophets while possessed by a Pah Wraith, we didn’t spend weeks on the Voyager tiptoeing around Kes because she might try to conquer the galaxy again like when she was being mind controlled by a dead dictator, and none of the people possessed by an ancient mask with the power to reshape their surroundings into an ancient temple got thrown in the brig for nearly killing everyone.  Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Can this season be watched without seeing the previous 2?  I bailed s1e2.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"wow, first time i've seen a nuTrek clip kind of trend. 👏"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I'd really love a Shaw series, most boring explorative mission in the history of Starfleet"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,You knows it’s good when even those schlubs over at RLM liked it.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"""The only Borg so deadly the gave him a goddamn name"" is not one of my favorite Star Trek lines, just under ""Its a cellular peptide cake, with mint frosting"""
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,I enjoyed the first season. I stopped watching season 2 after the third or fourth episode. I’m liking the new season
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,[Now I know why they named him Shaw.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9S41Kplsbs)
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Why is it so dark in Star Trek now.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,He can not hate Picard more then Picard hates himself for his failure on that day and allowing himself to become a Borg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuzoxcErOc8
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"This is good. I liked the episode.
But this is borrowed. We've already seen a captain (commander at the time) having an issue with Picard because of Wolf 359. I wish Trek would do something new. They keep referencing things over and over."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Wolf 359 is, of course, the darkly destructive planet that evolved as the result of a scientific experiment in season 2 episode 8 of the old ""The Outer Limits"" TV show."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I mean yeah, the backstory explains his behavior, but to me that didn’t excuse him from being an asshat.  :)"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I know this is nu-trek and I have to adjust my expectations of what a show with Star Trek in the title is BUT…everyone, without exception, is a *violent, emotional idiot*. 

I felt the entire character is so hacky and forced. 

Taking capt sisko’s backstory and giving it to another character was pretty lame. At least change the details a little! 

And sisko had more depth. There was the overdone survivor guilt angle, but also his desire to protect his remaining family and *leaving starfleet*

If you’re still *that* bitter 20+ years after the fact *and* still in the same organization that overwhelmingly praises the man that you solely blame for a significantly tragic moment in your life….how did this man reach captain? Oh right…you have to a violent emotional idiot to be a starfleet officer

This is not even close to what Star Trek is for me. But, unlike previous seasons/shows, at least it’s watchable. Is that what people are excited about?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Not a very captainly acting character. He's been a tantrum throwing bitch the whole season.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,I would have understood if the encounter with Picard had triggered PTSD or something. But that looks more like open resentment. Even though it was the Borg and not Picard himself. A distinction a Starfleet Captain should be able to make.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I'm sorry but this is still the same shit as the first two seasons. There's no difference between Admiral Hubris and Shaw. They're their just to berate and admonish Picard, Shaw will be doing it season long though (as Raffi did in S1 incidentally cause they can't write different characters).

Crusher introfuced exacrly as Seven was in S1&2, both guncrazed for some reason.

Worf is just Elnor now.

It also looks really bad. Why would I want to watch into something so dark, literally?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,They pulled a Captain Jellico. Shaw is a terrific character.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Oh, I loved his character since the first scene. His lambasting of Riker and Picard is priceless, and in the end he places them in the lower decks! Yes he was an asshole, but a master-level one. 

Starfleet is usually too nice and clean and with too many heroic figures, so I like when the occasional deeply flawed - but still competent in the end - character shows up. Another example of that, with a personality kind of opposite to Shaw, is Barclay."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I skipped season 1 and 2, so if Captain Shaw was introduced there, I missed it.  In episode 1, I didn't like Shaw, but it was clear that he's trying to be a company man.  It was impressive that he wasn't evil or a megalomaniac, just doing what he thought he was supposed to do.

I haven't watched episode 4 yet, but this season is really shaping up."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"as a lover of 12 monkeys
I am loving that Terry matalas is getting his due and he bought in a 12 monkeys actor and let him shine too"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"The first 4 episodes of Picard feel like a lost Star trek Movie. Multiple great character arcs with proper setup and payoff. The ending is classic Trek, they remember that they are supposed to be scientists, diplomats and explorers, not action heroes."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Haven't watched the past 2 seasons but that reminds me of the actors role in 12 monkeys show (also written/co written by matalas).
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I think they had close to *twenty* producers in the credits. 

The first two seasons were all over the fucking place, with just random shit thrown in that never pays off. A major part of the first season was this Borg cube, which gets reactivated…then the Borg just get blown into space, and cube crashes, and that’s it. 

The second season just had the most kind-numbing my stupid ideas anyone could conceive of. 

It’s like someone in the writers’ room was like “We should have a storyline addressing immigration,” and someone else decided the most efficient way of doing that would be to travel back in time to the present day, have one of the characters get arrested by ICE, and get beat up by an ICE officer. 

Like…this is science fiction. One of the main benefits is you’re able to use allegory and get people to look at their world in a different way. 

And don’t even get me started on Q. Someone just said “Let’s have Q back!” Then all the writers cheered. And someone said “Oh, and let’s have him be *sick* and then he can *die.*”

Nevermind the fact that it’s not explained and has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other storylines. Like the one where Picard has been sad his whole life because his mom hanged herself."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Chabon has talked about how much he loved Star Trek so he might have approached then. 

I absolutely love his novels, so I was very disappointed in how godawful S1 of Picard. The show violated Chekov's Gun rule and the producer has a Pulitzer Prize. Incredible. 

Also, someone loved Mass Effect,  because entire scenes and ideas were lifted from the game."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Terry Matalas is the new Showrunner. Michael Chabon has left completely along with Akiva Goldsman.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,I think he's the best thing about Picard season 3 so far - an interesting character who is very well acted by Todd Stashwick.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"TNG season 1 and 2 were not mind-mindbogglingly horrendous. They're very much watchable; they just found their groove with season 3. Picard season 3 feels more like ""Welp, we can't come up with any good new ideas, so let's just use old ones because they worked."""
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"This season is what season one should have been from the get go. Just like the original run, it took until season 3 to find its footing and Riker growing the beard.

Unfortunately it’s reading like this will be the last."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Can't argue with that. A pity that it took so long though, you would have thought that with the rich source of material they had to reference it wouldn't have taken so long."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,can you just start watching season 3? i don't want to watch 2 seasons of trash to get to the good.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Oof
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,The showrunner tweeted that it’s some kind of bug for that episode and that they fixed it. It wasn’t supposed to be that dim.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Strange New Worlds spent the light bulb budget for Star Trek...
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,That's sadly been the norm for quite a few years now.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"First season was at least watchable. Second was pure shit.

Third is what it should have been all along."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Yes Picard is the badmiral to Shaw
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,He's the Larry David of Star trek.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> The first two seasons of Picard are unwatacle trash,

Hard disagree."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?

Because logic doesn't override PTSD. 

Yes, Picard had no choice about being assimilated, or about leading the Borg assault on the fleet at Wolf 359. But he was still the face of that, he was the voice of that, and Locutus executed his job with apparent relish, to the point of tweaking Riker using Picard's own words. 

That's going to be remembered by Ben Sisko, who lost his wife at Wolf 359. It's going to be remembered by Shaw, who lost his friends and was then forced into a nightmarish choice. Those are events that leave powerful, fundamental marks on a person. And being able to think rationally that Picard had his mind taken over isn't going to stop the emotional feeling that he was somehow complicit, or that he could have done something more to resist, and maybe your loved ones would still be alive."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"[This gets a bit long, so there is a broad-strokes summary at the end]

I agree that the various shows almost never properly explore the long-term consequences of a lot of the stuff that happens, and are very selective in who is treated as culpable for certain things, but none of the examples you list are really comparable in the least. Keiko did not actually succeed, neither did Kes (though the Voyager crew did actually become more wary of her as time went on, and with good cause), and nothing permanently bad happened at all because of the masks -- just another weird day at the office. The only of these three that actually killed anyone was Kes, and in ""Warlord"" most of the people directly affected by her possession are confined to one community in the Delta Quadrant. I can well imagine that Ensign Martin's friends or family would harbour a grudge about this (the only Starfleet officer killed in that incident, if I recall correctly), but Kes is no longer around and it's all a moot point.

On the other side of this comparison, the cube at Wolf 359 -- evidently with the help of insights shared by Picard while enslaved as Locutus -- killed some 11,000 Starfleet personnel, almost all of them probably with surviving friends, family, or colleagues who had a good chance of still being alive over the ensuing decades. This is a wound that cuts deep, with many open nerves still exposed, and the people most affected are all in locations that Picard is likely to visit or at least in which he is likely to be known and spoken of. It probably hurts a great deal to keep seeing headlines like ""Picard saves the day again"" or ""Picard brokers peace between X and Y at last"" or whatever, month after month, when all you can experience when you sleep is the fire in the black and that green glow and the screams being torn out of your friends' lungs as the bulkheads decompressed.

Beyond all this, the fact that Picard was enslaved by the Borg at the time may mean less to people now than it used to. That it would have been a traumatic experience is not something many would doubt, but at least he got to come back from it -- unlike so many others. Even then, as the UFP has encountered a wider and wider variety of Borg and learned more about how the Collective works / worked, many may now reasonably wonder just how totally a ""puppet"" he was during these events. There's like a whole civil rights campaign about how Borg drones can actually maintain their individuality and ""selves"" in spite of assimilation, with some even managing to reassert these aspects of their identity even before being liberated from the Collective. If they could do it, why not Picard? Did he not try hard enough? 

All of this, too, is happening within the context of a broad realignment of UFP policy about the Borg to begin with. Lots of people are trying to take a more conciliatory tack, studying and working with the X-Bs at the Artifact and now trying to form an alliance of sorts with Jurati's Legion, or whatever they're calling it. Lots of people must be pretty unhappy about this, given how many UFP people the Borg have killed on multiple occasions, so it is quite possible that some people are not ready to just treat everything as though it's water under the bridge.

**In summary:** For good or for bad, much as was the case with his role AS Locutus in the first place, Picard is the visible face of a nightmare from which many UFP people still cannot awaken. Even if the Borg were ultimately prevented from conquering the Alpha Quadrant, they still killed thousands with Locutus' help. It is worth remembering that Wolf 359 was likely one of the most traumatic events in Starfleet history for a generation, up to that point -- not only the fact of so many dead at once, but with no hope at all of defending themselves. It was a complete unsettling of certainty and security, comparable to something like the [Battle of Isandlwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Isandlwana) during the Anglo-Zulu War. Maybe it's unfair that the pain generated by this kind of loss has been displaced onto Picard, but it should not at all be surprising or inexplicable."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Picard as Locutus didn't just try to kill people, he did. 11,000 people and almost 40 starships died at the Borg's hands, ""led"" by Locutus and if it wasn't for the crew of E-D, Earth would have been absolutely devastated. Before the Dominion War it might have been the single biggest loss of life in Starfleet's history, almost certainly certainly the biggest in the previous 100 years.

Wolf 359 was basically the Federation's equivalent to 9/11."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Because he was so good at it?
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> Why does Picard get so much shit for the time the Borg used him as a hand puppet?

Bad Writing.

> “I’m sorry I tried to kill you, I was possessed by an evil alien entity at the time” is such a common apology in Star Trek there’s probably a section at Hallmark.

This gets funnier the more I think about it. I regret I have but one upvote to give."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,">No one is blaming Keiko O’Brien for trying to murder the Prophets

ugg please don't remind me of that episode."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Yeah you can just start with this one, it's basically a reboot. Only one new character from the first two seasons is still around."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Yes, thankfully you can ignore seasons 1 and 2. They are pits of despair due to a lot of atrocious writing."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Yeah, I think there might be one fact from season 1 you'd want to know but it hasn't played a big role in season 3 so far, just maybe one minor mention.  Season 2 is utterly forgettable and garbage."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Yes. But you're cheating yourself if you don't at least watch S1. It starts a little slow, but it's worth it."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Not the first one. I've seen quite a few Strange New Worlds posts getting upvoted.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"It's also true. Man. 

https://www.britannica.com/topic/USS-Indianapolis"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,In the future electricity costs even more than it does now.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Most if the power was going to life-support! All the ships in this season are almost on the verge of exploding... Except The Shrike but it's mandatory for the bad guys' ships to be dim and dark.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Strange New Worlds must have stolen all the lightbulbs, because that show is definitely brightly lit."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Well, alternatively, why was TNG and TOS so bright? I think it's fair to reason that they shot so much on a small budget that it was easier to just keep the set brightly lit all the time. VOY, ENT and DS9 are better compromises with the lighting IMO."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"To be fair, it has been awhile since we saw such an interaction…and Shaw’s monologue is way more harsh / bitter than the one given by Sisko, which was buried, but still respectful anger."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Hack writers can't move past Wrath of Kahn and the Borg.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Can you accept that everyone is going to have a different reaction to Picard's role in the Battle of Wolf 359?

Most of the younger officers revere Picard as a legendary decorated Starfleet officer. We've seen them reverently asking Picard for his personal view on events. We've also seen Titan's bridge crew hesitate when Shaw gave the order to leave Picard to his fate.

So far, we have only seen two officers who hated Picard's role at Wolf 359 - Sisko and Shaw. Both of them are also survivors of Wolf 359. I'm sure there are more, but given the statistical sampling we have been given, Sisko and Shaw are in the minority. 

This fits reality quite well. Not every hero is going to be viewed as one by everybody. Shaw's survivor's guilt has delayed his career, taking him a full 30+ years to painfully work his way up to the rank of captain. Surely you can allow for one man to not be aligned with the rest of Starfleet where Picard is concerned?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> everyone, without exception, is a violent, emotional idiot.

When was Shaw Violent?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> you have to a violent emotional idiot to be a starfleet officer

It worked for Kirk.   j/k"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"First they took his hobby of cooking, since Pike does that now, and now they’re taking his tragic origin story"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,He used his engineering to follow the protocols exactly throughout his career and landed the Titan in the vacuum of Riker leaving. We only saw him while stuck with a former Borg first officer and seeing the man he blames for his cripplng survivors guilt. Definitely an ass but I bet he has more to show still.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Survivors guilt seemed to be a major factor too. He survived by shear luck. So from then on he followed all protocol to a t.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,[removed]
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I'd say he honestly works better than Jellico. Jellico came into his story throwing his weight around for no good reason. Shaw was even more of a jerk, but he has an entirely legitimate and traumatic reason for that behavior when faced with Picard and Seven at the same time. You can imagine Shaw probably being a pretty normal Captain removed from the biggest traumatic trigger he could imagine, meanwhile I can only assume Jellico was a control freak in every command he ever had including ones where he was only stepping in on a temporary basis as the ""supply captain""."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"The first scene with Seven cemented it for me, yes the OPs scene they’ve linked was fantastic but that scene was just great.

“Hey Hanson, bang up job your heroes are doing with my ship, love the view”

Lifetime fan of the character after that line 😂"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"All if Star Trek now is basically bad people and flawed characters to be edgy. It's bullshit, unoriginal and lazy. There is very little of the new shows that is Star Trek and they could work as a new standalone big budget sci-fi franchise"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Shaw is fresh for this season. Enjoy
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,The first 4 episodes basically serve as a first act. If you took out the stuff with Raffi and Worf it could easily work as a standalone movie with threads left dangling for the sequel. I'm very impressed so far.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,Deacon was a crucial part of the 12 Monkeys mix. The yin to Dr Jones' yang.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Star Trek: Discovery also had an obscene number of production credits. It's like, okay, I get it, all that movie-grade CGI isn't cheap. That series always looked pretty impressive for a TV show. A lot of the time, someone will be credited as a producer when all they really did the whole time was contribute money. But there's always the possibility that they might have also demanded some amount of creative input in exchange for doing that."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> The first two seasons were all over the fucking place, with just random shit thrown in that never pays off.

My pet theory has always been that season 2 came about when those twenty producers all got *really* drunk at a bar together one night and scrawled a bunch of incoherent random nonsense about Star Trek and other various unrelated topics on a bunch of cocktail napkins, then the next morning at the studio they gave each napkin to a different intern and demanded an episode script based on it by the end of the day."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"S1 at least was bleeding awful early on. Like, people couldn't deliver lines ( Patrick Stewart to the side ). I do not recall S2 that much. 

My understanding is that things improved after they got Roddenberry less involved. 

> Picard season 3 feels more like ""Welp, we can't come up with any good new ideas, so let's just use old ones because they worked.""

TOS started in *1967*. The whole thing is a massive legacy property."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I don’t agree. I thought the first two seasons were boring and miserable.


Edit: apologies for any confusion. I was referring to Picard"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,TNG seasons 1 and 2 were like Hamlet compared to PIC seasons 1 and 2 lol
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I'm just hoping it leads to a spin-off with Shaw, Seven, and the Titan. Maybe some other old cast (like Frakes\Dorn) stick around even if Patrick Stewart is done."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,">True, but bad as seasons 1 and 2 of TNG were they had some good, even great, episodes as well. I also have to say that even a bad episode of those seasons is better than the best episode of Picard seasons 1 and 2. 
>
>Also, even when it was bad, TNG was always fun, something that Picard seasons 1 and 2 forgot about (they are either too 'dark' or very clumsily go in the opposite direction and end up stupidly goofy).

We're talking about season 3 though, not rehashing older bad seasons to keep your hate boners erect."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,I'd say for most part yes. There are some call backs mostly as quick close offs or quick jokes so don't think you'll miss those. One of the characters has developed quite a bit in the intervening 20 years so that might be jarring. You'll be a little behind there but don't think it will hurt story.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"If you know TNG and remember Seven from VOY, you should be good. Only one or two new characters (one having only a minor role for this season so far) from the first 2 seasons appeared only in Picard, and you'll manage. 

If you know nothing about the TNG era and the major story points and characters, I am not sure the series would work. (Even though they'll get you some basics for the major story threads, the characters and the story just won't have the impact.)"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"You would miss one of the best ones, 2x9, the measure of a man. One of my all time favorites, there were some good episodes in season 2."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,">Oof

oof"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I think that's only half the issue. The showrunner was talking about more of a contrast/compression issue on streaming which kinda made things look muddled, but their lighting choices are also just on the dark and dim side. I don't mind it that much, but I think I would prefer just a little more warmth in the lighting like in the TOS films or SNW."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,But it's been every episode this season. I feel like no one on that ship can see a frickin thing!
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Wasn’t there a “bug” the week before where everything was horribly oversaturated?

How is it possible to have a “bug” like this? They’re spending *millions of dollars* on every episode, then someone just uses the wrong settings when they export or upload the video?

And no one bothers to check it ahead of time?"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"And they do a REALLY bad job of hiding the fact that they are up to some sketchy stuff. ""Oh yes, we'll just fly off to this random system in the opposite direction of our destination. It will impress people, or something."""
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"I think with Sisko the context is also important. It’s three years after he lost his wife and the mother of his child as well as his ship and presumably friends. He put his life on hold for those three years at Utopia Planetia then his first mission back out he runs into a Picard who has no idea who he is and even starts smiling when he realises Sisko knows him, mistakenly thinking he’s forgotten them meeting before.

Now that’s the setup for it, but by the end of the episode Sisko is far more at peace having processed some of his feelings in the episode and is far less hostile to Picard.

EDIT: Also for context for anyone not familiar with it, Wolf 359 was likely the single most destructive loss in the Federation's history. By the time of Wolf 359 the Federation had become accustomed to having amongst the most powerful starships in the quadrant with very little able to assail them directly. Wolf 359 saw thirty nine vessels destroyed in a battle with a single Borg cube; an unprecedented loss to a single vessel, of which the Borg have a large but indeterminate number. That cube then took a run at Earth and made it into the Solar system before being deactivated by fluke; a unique connection between the then recovered Locutus and the vessel itself. This was very much the Federation's 9/11 and their reaction to it was based on the horror that a probing attack by a single Borg vessel had nearly beaten the Federation.

EDIT 2: Also I suspect Locutus wasn't named because he was deadly, Locutus is slightly fluffed latin that seems intended to translate as 'speaker'. Locutus is fundamentally a borg/human diplomat designed to ease the Federation into assimilation. When Locutus says 'I am Locutus of Borg' he means he's the Borg's spokesman."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,There is also probably a hypospray they can give you that just removes the biological effects of PTSD.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Wow. Wow. Wow. Everything I just read makes me super super glad I stopped watching Picard halfway through the first season. That is all so dumb. I’m so amazingly dumb. I thought Voyager ruined the Borg, but fuck it seems like this show done *ruined* the Borg.  Fair enough. I concede that this dude in this stupid ass timeline where the Borg are no longer the Borg, may have a valid complaint."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Yup.  Wolf 359 changed the entire tone of the franchise going forward: Federation officers got more militaristic and rivals like the Cardassians got bolder.

Then that all started to spiral with the Maquis and later the Dominion - the next big cultural upset for the Federation."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"lol

they just said fuck it and threw out the garbage huh"
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,And that character wasn't even in this episode.
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,But then you wont know why Picard is making out with someone that could be his granddaughter in the first episode!
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"> but it's worth it.

No it's not. Both S1 and S2 are a disaster."
Wolf Girl and Black Prince,"Picard is literally some of the worst TV I’ve ever seen, made me want to scratch my own eyes out of my sockets as the pain from that experience would be more enjoyable than what I was being forced to watch

No one should EVER watch Picard 1 and 2. EVER"
Ingobernable,[deleted]
Ingobernable,Trailer looks great. 
Ingobernable,Is this on all territory Netflix because I'm craving crime dramas like mad
Ingobernable,"Thanks for this, I was trying to decide whether I should try this or not, and now I definitely will."
Ingobernable,This was just as cheesy as any telenovela I've ever seen and I only watches the first 3.They didn't even try to make the scenarios seem believable or logical. The acting was the only saving grace. 
Ingobernable,"Dude, I'm in the same boat you are, and agree 100%. This show is actually really awesome!"
Ingobernable,It's a Netflix original so I'd assume so.
Ingobernable,I hope. Its really good.
Dave Chappelle,Ok now bring back the Community DnD episode if offending people isn't a problem for you
Dave Chappelle,No shit the guy making money from it doesn't mind the fuss. If anything he's probably hoping the next special garners even more controversy.
Dave Chappelle,Someone is going to buy Dave’s special and make money from it. It should come as no surprise that a businessman would want in on that action.
Dave Chappelle,"I didn't find Chappelle as funny as he once was, but I absolutely think that it is to comedy's detriment when we designate certain topics as sacred cows, immune from discussion. The best comedians challenge status quo and will likely cause some type of offense. Comedy should be fearless."
Dave Chappelle,This website over estimates how controversial his specials are. The man hosted SNL. Only people who spend all day on Reddit and Twitter were triggered and they make up less of the population than trans people
Dave Chappelle,But I thought he was canceled??  Now I'll have to wait for his next special to hear all the things that he's not allowed to say anymore while saying them and being paid millions to.
Dave Chappelle,"I’ll give any Chappelle project a chance. However, I watched most of The Closer and I don’t think I laughed a single time. It was just him lecturing the audience. If that’s his style now and it works for him and Netflix then go for it."
Dave Chappelle,Will it just be two hours of Dave Chapelle saying he’s the GOAT and ranting about the dangers of cancel culture? Hopefully he has better “material” this time.
Dave Chappelle,"I'm trans and a progressive lefty. 

I don't give a fuck if Dave makes 'jokes' about transpeople. He can say what he want, _I've said things to myself that are a thousand times worse_. I care a lot more about actual important issues like getting the health care I need, or not being discriminated in the workplace. Most of these issues people don't want to talk about, because that would mean ACTUAL and REAL change. So let's keep talking about... some jokes... and not actually help my group to have it a bit easier in life?

However, if he is allowed to do that, I'm allowed to express some criticism as well. His jokes just weren't funny, and it mostly sounded like him just venting his emotions. Most of his work is getting worse the older he gets. 

He keeps whining about being ""cancelled"", like he isn't earning more money than most of the people commenting in this thread COMBINED. If criticising Dave is cancel culture, then him criticising transpeople is cancel culture too, right? Except I don't get a giant paycheck for bitching about someone else. 

I've seen a lot of comedians make jokes about controversial topics. Dave just isn't good at it anymore. Bill Burr's last special had a lot of jokes about controversial topics and minority groups and it was funny as shit. 

So maybe we can stop crying about lame jokes and """"CaNcEl CuLtUrE"" and fix the waiting list in my country that's 3 years long for transpeople?

EDIT: 

For any easily offended person reading this, I just want to make clear: this is all just my opinion. Obviously, that was already clear from the beginning, but just to be sure no one starts crying like a bitch because I dared to use my goddamn freedom of speech to express an opinion: it's just an opinion. Imo imo imo imo imo imo imo imo."
Dave Chappelle,"I see we have a ""popular = correct"" crowd."
Dave Chappelle,"I dont really give a fuck whether Dave's content is taboo... I honestly just do not find his standup funny anymore. It feels like all he does is whine about how people aren't being ""fair"" to him."
Dave Chappelle,"At the same event, he acclaimed Elon Musk and said that launching the new Knives Out in the movie theaters is just to make noise. Looks like he's out to be hated by Hollywood. Jealous of Zaslav?"
Dave Chappelle,"You know this topic is divisive when both, pro-Dave and anti-Dave comments are getting downvoted."
Dave Chappelle,"The only way Chappelle goes away is if people stop watching him. Obviously, that's not happening."
Dave Chappelle,"This is one of the few times I honestly completely agree with the CEO.

Censorship is never the solution."
Dave Chappelle,…you got anymore of them Dave Chapelle specials?? (scratching neck and chest)
Dave Chappelle,"CEO likes money, who would have guessed."
Dave Chappelle,Great. I'm a big fan of Dave Chappelle.
Dave Chappelle,"I’ve been complaining to my CEO for years, do they listen to me? 
No.

What makes anyone think a money driven ceo from netflix is going to listen to a few employees?"
Dave Chappelle,"Protecting comedy, love to see it"
Dave Chappelle,Dave is funny as fuck.
Dave Chappelle,Dave is awesome…… f*ck cancel culture
Dave Chappelle,And I'll watch them again and again.
Dave Chappelle,Maybe reed should worry about subscriber count …
Dave Chappelle,"Eh I love Dave Chapelle's specials.  There was one of them were the jokes on the trans community got too repetitive though to the point of not being funny, dont remember the one.  The one about ""the alphabet people"" was very funny."
Dave Chappelle,Good….now quit nickel and diming your customers.
Dave Chappelle,So the message here is fans of pretty much any Netflix show should instead of save our show campaigns should just get some Netflix employees and others to all protest a next season.
Dave Chappelle,Stop canceling so many shows and no one would give a fuck fucking asshole
Dave Chappelle,Based Netflix
Dave Chappelle,Love Dave Chapelle!!
Dave Chappelle,Despite not returning a profit greater than other programming that he canceled. Why? Because he wants to hang out with Dave.
Dave Chappelle,"Help him bring the new chapelle show to the surface then, he’s been wanting to do it ever since he got his rights back"
Dave Chappelle,"Here’s a secret, the folks who love Dave and subscribe for his specials don’t care about any of the drama from social activists."
Dave Chappelle,"I love Chappelle, I just wish he wasn't obsessed with trans stuff. It's not funny at this point, just boring and weird."
Dave Chappelle,"If you don’t like it, then it’s not for you. Go watch another comedian."
Dave Chappelle,"And I'm sure he'll keep doing ""bits"" about how cancelled he is."
Dave Chappelle,"Love Dave Chappelle. The same people that say ""well he's not funny anymore"" also try to act like he's some sort of trans-hating monster. His entire career has been indiscriminate shock value humor but when he targets LGBTQ suddenly he's the biggest bigot on the earth and needs cancelling. Then he tries to be philosophical and basically just tell people to love each other. Shit is wild."
Dave Chappelle,I'll never understand why some people want censorship so badly.
Dave Chappelle,I love Dave. My favorite comedian and a great person.
Dave Chappelle,The fake outrage is only a small vocal percentage of viewers. People love Chappelle.
Dave Chappelle,Because Dave is amazing
Dave Chappelle,It doesn't seem that employees understand that Netflix users pay their salaries.  Being upset for giving the customers what they want is a strange position to have as an employee.
Dave Chappelle,"Employee backlash? For what? It’s Dave Chappelle, a comedian, making jokes. Holy fuck lol"
Dave Chappelle,Dave Chappelle is funny and people love watching him. Seems like pretty simple math to me.
Dave Chappelle,Jokes are funny. I like jokes.
Dave Chappelle,"Good, free speech is important and Dave Chappelle is hilarious."
Dave Chappelle,Ever heard of controversy creating cash?
Dave Chappelle,"good, they're hilarious 

every - and I mean every group - should be able to be made fun of"
Dave Chappelle,"Has nothing to do with whether he supports dave or the other side. It's just good money. Wait till the backlash is enough to cause him loses, see how quickly he changes his stance"
Dave Chappelle,Is this the cancel culture he was complaining about?
Dave Chappelle,[removed]
Dave Chappelle,Genuinely curious what happened to if you don’t like it don’t watch ut
Dave Chappelle,He makes them money.
Dave Chappelle,oh god who cares anymore
Dave Chappelle,I mean a Netflix is a business not a humanitarian no profit
Dave Chappelle,Good.  The people mad at Chappell are out of their god damn minds.
Dave Chappelle,"Looking forward to them!

Edit: downvoted for this really?"
Dave Chappelle,"And I will watch every single one! Dave Chappelle is one of the greatest comedians of all time. 

Downvote your lives away ¯|_(ツ)_|¯"
Dave Chappelle,"Will the specials actually start to be funny if they keep on making them? That was my biggest takeaway from the Chappelle specials, the stand up just isn't that good and the format just doesn't fit the social commentary Chappelle is obviously desperate for everyone to hear his thoughts on. Or at least it doesn't fit as far as Chappelle talents go, in this arena he is no George Carlin."
Dave Chappelle,"Good. If they want to be whiney shits who think the world revolves around them and a company should bow to their every demand, they can go work somewhere else."
Dave Chappelle,"Why does this article exist? Who cares? 

Why do I need to hear about Chapelle every day"
Dave Chappelle,"I don't agree with every last thing Dave Chappelle says. Luckily, he's a comedian, so that doesn't matter at ALL."
Dave Chappelle,"Good, Dave is hilarious and he’s doing what comedians have always done, which is pushing the status quo. If you really listen to what he’s saying, you might not be so offended…comedy is supposed to be somewhat offensive, not hateful, just making fun, and that is exactly what Dave does"
Dave Chappelle,"Comedy's not supposed to appeal to everybody, it's supposed to be daring an edgy. Chappelle is a genius."
Dave Chappelle,"I mean Netflix is a content and analytics business. Dave Chapelle's specials are routinely some of the most top-watched things on Netflix period. Dave Chappelle is not telling people to kill trans people. He's doing a stand up comedy bit on a stage. People have the chance to simply not watch the shit or not. Netflix employees being offended by the content that's on the platform should probably either seek other employment or understand that not all of the content your employer puts on their platform is something that you're going to agree with. Suck that up or simply don't work there. 

One of my first jobs in college was working as a front desk receptionist at a doctors office. I watched as the doctor came in an hour late every day despite booking patients to come in an hour earlier, I watched him give people opiods who were hooked on opiods, basically make up shit about the person being injured to keep his connections with the injury lawyers, etc. I felt the doctor and the company was unethical so I quit. That's what standing your ground means. 

 What people don't realize is that if you ignore and don't talk about someone then that person slowly fades. I don't think Dave's last special was that strong. I think it was mediorce work by his standards, but what propelled that special for months was the outrage by people being offended by jokes. Look at what happened to that rapper da baby. He said a bunch of what was perceived homophobic jokes people were outraged, but then boycotted his music and ignored his content and now he's irrelevant. I doubt that happens to Dave, but the more people that are offended by his specials just simply stop watching the special the more those specials won't be a big thing any longer."
Dave Chappelle,So long as they’re funny and are profitable I don’t see why he wouldn’t.
Dave Chappelle,Good. He’s funny
Dave Chappelle,Employees shouldn't think they have the influence to make changes in content based on their own personal views.   Nice to see a CEO keep them in their place.   They should work somewhere else if they are effected when 100% of shows don't fit their positions.
Dave Chappelle,Bring it on. More stuff for me to watch.
Dave Chappelle,Wonderful! Can't wait to see them!
Dave Chappelle,Ah! The reliable gears of capitalism at work.
Dave Chappelle,"I think that the CEO is acknowledging the fact that even if a show/podcast is controversial cancelling it is a bad play if it is also one of your most viewed materials. Everyone on this publication is making fun about Chappelles take on cancel culture and how he pushes his own agenda but let's be honest this whole article is about a group of people trying to cancel the very thing that gives them money over their own agenda because if it was a matter of moral they would have just said ""well I quit"" after all they are employees on a major company on the industry, they wouldn't have a problem finding a decent job in the short term."
Dave Chappelle,And I’ll keep watching them.
Dave Chappelle,"The last person a culture should ever cancel is a comedian. They are by design meant to shock and outrage, to entertain and exploit, to brazenly speak on topics polite society ignores. Banning comedians is the first step toward tyranny."
Dave Chappelle,Where are all the people boycotting Hulu/DirecTV/Youtube TV/etc for carrying Fox News with the same/worse talking points than anything Dave Chappelle has ever said?
Dave Chappelle,"What the fuss with Dave Chappel?

Are people angry that Dave likes to have no borders on comedy?

Because if that's the case, good for him to challenge those who want borders."
Dave Chappelle,"Let Dave tank if he isn’t funny, don’t try and make him into legend by censoring him into mythology"
Dave Chappelle,"And I'll watch them.

I watch comedy to laugh, and I want the envelope pushed. 

He does both. There are safer comics out there that are still incredibly funny. Watch them."
Dave Chappelle,Stop trying to cancel comedians you twitter tyrants. If your world view is threatened by *some jokes* then I'd argue you lack the courage of your convictions and are just seeking attention through misplaced virtue signalling.
Dave Chappelle,That's what we like to hear!
Dave Chappelle,"Good. Time plus tragedy equals comedy. Getting offended at jokes is your prerogative. It's stupid but it's your prerogative none the less. As the old saying goes, ""take a joke or take a hike."""
Dave Chappelle,Good. The people that call him out literally didn't even listen to what he was saying.
Dave Chappelle,"This is the same thinking that leads to adverts on Netflix.  On an infinite human timeline, greed always wins."
Dave Chappelle,Yea but are they working? Are they still pulling in the numbers? I’m used to be a fan but the specials just haven’t been funny.
Dave Chappelle,The outrage over this man seemed to be truly manufactured.
Dave Chappelle,Can’t cancel the king
Dave Chappelle,Good.
Dave Chappelle,"To be honest I find the whole idea of employees trying to prevent something from being on the platform they work for kinda funny.

You want to have power as an employee, join a union."
Dave Chappelle,"“My life isn’t in danger, why would I care?”"
Dave Chappelle,"I'm not gonna watch his next special unless it gets great word of mouth. Not because of any moral feelings, just because the last few haven't been funny to me."
Dave Chappelle,"Oh no, how dare someone have the freedom to choose."
Dave Chappelle,Good. Dave Chappelle is hilarious.
Dave Chappelle,Awesome! I love Dave!
Dave Chappelle,And I'll keep watching and laughing.
Dave Chappelle,Good Dave is one of the only good things on Netflix fuck the staff if they don’t like him
Dave Chappelle,"2005:  OMG CHAPPELLE IS GREAT
2021: whoa whoa.  He’s gone too far.

Society has become way too sensitive."
Dave Chappelle,"Americans are so blithely ignorant and yet so privileged that their ""feels"" are everything when they are simply not smart enough to understand that their ""feels"" are easily manipulated.  
ATTENTION:  
There is a difference between overt, concentrated, aggressive bigotry and observational comedy that brings about complex multifaceted conversation."
Dave Chappelle,Good. F the woke mob
Dave Chappelle,"I mean.. good.

Comedy is supposed to be uncomfortable and push boundaries"
Dave Chappelle,"Could be because he specials are funny

And employees might not be much of a comedy crowd"
Mononoke,"He think he's more similar to a Coen Brothers villain. He's cold, calculating, has no morals and isn't phased by his actions.

He's very similar to Anton Chigurgh or Leonard Smalls. The violence and chaos he creates are solely for his entertainment and he's just unstoppable"
Mononoke,"I see how he's a similar to a Coen Brothers villain, but I don't know that the chaos he's creating is necessarily solely for his own entertainment.

Well, to some degree, but I don't think 'entertainment' is the right word -- he's a modern predator, and his thirst for the hunt is only satiated by more killing.  Hence all the wolf imagery, talk of hunters, and other characters mentioning  how 'men like him don't stop.' 

Have you seen Mononoke?  The two characters are extremely alike... Jigo the Monk was certainly not as crazy, his motivations were more aligned with wealth and fame rather than simply his hunter instincts, but that aside there are definitely similarities. 

"
Mononoke,The Dalai Lama’s name is Tenzin Gyatso so the franchise used both his names for characters.
Mononoke,">The culture of the Water Tribes, as well as their location in the polar regions of the world, is primarily based on the real-life Arctic cultures such as the Inuit and Yupik.

It makes sense that water benders would mostly live on the poles. Since they have so much control over water, they would want to live in a place where they could use water as a building material. The water tribes basically just eliminated a large portion of the population to focus on other labor, since construction and repair are now no longer labor intensive projects. This also explains why the southern water tribe seems much more on the brink of collapse in season 1, because all of their water benders have left.

Similarly, in the earth kingdom, construction and repair are really, really easy, so although the cities of Ba Sing Se and Omashu are supposed to look amazing, it's not a very impressive feat for the earth civilization to have such large cities because creating a building in stone doesn't take much effort for their benders."
Mononoke,Speaking of the original earthbender I believe I read that he was repurposed  to be avatar rokus earthbending teacher
Mononoke,"Bolin in Legend of Korra resembles Toph's earlier male design.

Also maleToph was supposed to be a love interest for Katara!"
Mononoke,"The original series order was only for 13 episodes. This made the last two episodes of the original production The Storm and The Blue Spirit, with a 6 month gap between it and the next episode.

In an alternate universe where the show failed, that would have been two great episodes to go out on... but imagine that being the ending."
Mononoke,"I didn’t realize it when the movie came out, but it’s obvious in hindsight that one of reasons the studio/ M. Night Shyamalan white-washed the cast was to avoid angering China, by making the Tibetan influence on the character less obvious. Disney did the same thing when they cast Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One in Doctor Strange. I hope Netflix is willing to cast Asian and First Nations actors in the lead roles and cast diversely for the Earth Nation since that would actually make sense in the context of the show. 😐"
Mononoke,Thanks for this!
Mononoke,"even after all these and multiple viewings, reading stuff like this about the show gives me goosebumps"
Mononoke,Can anyone give me a site where I can watch Avatar. I've been meaning to watch but couldn't find it.
Mononoke,I seem to remember reading (so this could be entirely wrong) that they changed Toph from a large male character to a little girl because one of the creators made a joke about doing that and they realized that that would actually be way better. And it was.
Mononoke,"Interesting to note that Azula’s name is based on the Spanish word for blue, “Azul”."
Mononoke,"The comics as well as the Kyoshi novel go into it more. The Southern Water Tribe has basically always been a 3rd world country in the eyes of the rest of the world, pitiful at best, dangerous and savage at worst. Snow Savage is used as a derogatory term by the other nations. (Ash-Maker and Dirt Girl/Guy are also used depending on who's insulting whom). Pakku and others from the North made it a city after the war but a lot of Southerners started to feel like they were losing their culture and were just being a cheap copy of the North. Katara and Sokka's father Hakoda and his new girlfriend from the North found a large oil reserve and wanted to use it for money to develop the South as the world's industrial revolution was taking off. Katara hated the environmental damage it would cause but Sokka loved the machines making things more fair for nonbenders. Aang also didn't like the environmental cost whereas the Beinfongs stood to profit from it and Toph helped with early planning via metalbending. 

Back in Kyoshi's time when she was still a teenager some pirates had gotten strong over a few generations and recruited some earthbenders and firebenders as well, calling themselves The Fifth Nation. They're ships were small though and they couldn't really expand since The South doesn't have trees to build better ships with. The Fifth Nation had essentially boxed in The Southern Tribe and even started kidnapping people from southern Earth Kingdom villages as slaves, intending to invade and take over Yakoya, the orginal name of Kyoshi's village when it was still attached to the mainland for the trees, carpenters etc for a better fleet.

At this time Lu Beifong Toph's ancestor refused to loan The Southern Tribe any money or materials for their own defense since they could turn around and use it against the Earth Kingdom."
Mononoke,"Thankfully it didn't turn out that way, wow."
Mononoke,"Close, it was actually a 3-month gap, but everything else you said was true."
Mononoke,"Whoa! I didn't know that one, that's very interesting."
Mononoke,It’s on Netflix US!
Mononoke,Netflix
Mononoke,I'm from India so it isn't available yet. So I'll try Torrent then.
Mononoke,Netflix
Mononoke,"As someone who loves the show but has never really gotten into the broader universe (well I watched Korra too, but I never got into the comics and didn't even know there were novels), thanks for writing this up. Super cool to read."
Mononoke,I can't see that working
Mononoke,I hope you enjoy the show!
Mononoke,"You're welcome. Kyoshi is also half Air Nomad and was actually an orphan servant girl for Yun, one of her best friends that the world and Kyoshi herself believed was the Avatar for a number of years."
Mononoke,"PRIMAL is a great example of what animation, especially outside of comedy, can be in the hands of skilled directors."
Mononoke,Did the second half drop yet?
Mononoke,Great animation and style
Mononoke,"It's a fantastic show. I always wanted to get into Samurai Jack, because it looked really interesting but I just never really could get into it... primal on the other hand is exhilarating. I can't wait for the rest of the episodes."
Mononoke,I heard good things about it so I’ll likely check it out.
Mononoke,No. And I have no idea why not. It's only another 5 episodes and they are supposedly already completed. If I have to wait til October I will be pissed.
Mononoke,There's a second half?!
Mononoke,TL:DR 
Mononoke,"The Simpsons is a product of the 90s, I agree.  It’s no longer relevant in our time, and even the show acknowledges it.

It’s just a job for them now, and with nothing left to prove, and no motivation to improve, it’s no wonder it’s such a boring show."
Mononoke,"I was downvoted for saying what most fans thought that the series has gone downhill since 11. Most fans don't even recognize anything past 11. 1-9 are generally agreed to be the glory days, 9-12 are meh, and anything after that is pushing it. "
Mononoke,"Yeah the have really milked it for far too long, I stopped watching a long time ago. "
Mononoke,"If definitely is a product of the 90s and became Zombie Simpsons, but it's not like it died *because* the 90s ended. It died because they ran out of storylines.

There's no way you can keep a long-running show fresh. I'm sure there are examples of shows that have defied this general rule, but as a general rule, it's quite a good one. So many shows have run on too long and tarnished their own good names.

EDIT: To anyone who hasn't read this fantastic article / essay, it's amazing. Will take quite a long time to read though, so budget some time or prepare to read a chapter at a time: 
https://deadhomersociety.com/zombiesimpsons/"
Mononoke,"I blame social media and the “news” for ruining everything. Easily offended people can go on there to cry and be supported by other countless dolts. Some news outlet picks up the story and makes a even bigger deal out of nothing. It’s a yellow snowball effect. 
Bad/negative publicity is not good even if it’s not true and corporate just wants to play it safe. So, we now get watered down version of what we once used to enjoy that panders to the care bears. "
Mononoke,I miss the DHS blog.
Mononoke,Seconded 
Mononoke,"Do you agree Bojack Horseman, Rick and Morty, Archer, Castlevania etc. are more relevant adult animation than Zombie Simpsons? and it's time to bury The Simpsons and remember the good old 90s show of it as in the REAL Simpsons and cherish seasons 1 to 10?"
Mononoke,9 and 10 had some decent episodes but you agree the show should had ended in 2001?
Mononoke,I stopped in 2003
Mononoke,love that site
Mononoke,You agree with everything i said?
Mononoke,I'm pretty sure it was something about gatekeeping. But who will every know?
Mononoke,. 
Mononoke,"I’m not sure how I didn’t make that clear lol.  The Simpsons isn’t about creativity/entertainment at this point... it’s a cash cow. 

All of the shows you mentioned have miles more creativity/entertainment value and are more relevant to today’s world."
Mononoke,I don't know when I stopped watching it just happened slowly and it really wasn't really conscious on my part.
Mononoke," 

although I’ve stuck with the zombie theme in saying that early episodes suffering from a subtle decline are like a “freshly bitten” zombie. You know something’s wrong with the person, you just can’t place it, and other people in the group keep trying to defend them, either due to denial or willful ignorance. But then as the wound starts festering and the infected person starts eying everyone’s craniums, you get more and more suspicious until the bitten individual latches on to one of the last stubborn members in the group who is in mid speech defending them, and takes a bite out of their face. At that point, most of the group acts accordingly, and anyone still willing to defend the zombie deserves what’s coming to them, getting killed or infected themselves.

But the problem with Zombie Simpsons is that there’s a disproportionate amount of defenders in denial while the stinking, rotting corpse is gnawing on their skulls. We’re past B-flick territory and are firmly entrenched in Z-grade scripts."
Mononoke," The Simpsons is like the family dog: We all grew up with it, love and cherish all the memories, but sadly, the time has come to put it down. "
Mononoke,Sam literally hates his dad. I don't see him doing that 
Mononoke,Samwell hates his dad.  And he loves Jon Snow.  He’s not gonna side with his asshole dad’s memory over what Jon is telling him to do. That’s just dumb.
Mononoke,None of this is happening.
Mononoke,"I always thought of Arya as Princess Mononoke when I was reading the books. I dream of the day she rides Nymeria into a battle with the army of wolves behind her. But we're unlikely to see that in the show. And seeing how much George dislikes war, we may not see it in the books either. It's would just be too badass for people to see it in a negative light."
Mononoke,Some of those are pretty outlandish. Why do you think those things?
Mononoke,"Dunno about all that, but I'm pretty sure Bran will warg into a dragon."
Mononoke,I disagree with most of this - but I do think Dany will die.
Mononoke,"this is a joke, right"
Mononoke,You forgot the part where Tyrion will be executed for treason 🙄
Mononoke,[deleted]
Mononoke,Did you see Sam being the guy to kill a white walker?
Mononoke,"Because...

1. Great Libraries are known to burn throwing the world into a dark age.

2. Samwell Tarley is that guy no one suspects will pose a threat.

3. The Maesters were discussing a prophecy that the drowned god will come for Aegon the Conquerer.

4. Dragons & Knights equal Dragonlance.

5. Arya Stark is basically Princess Mononoke.

6. Because the metal rings around the star are real - part of the Propulsion system for the moving of the dyson sphere. The white walkers are a ghost in the nanomachine swarm that normally repairs the dyson sphere.

7. Bron said he would climb it in season one."
Mononoke,A bit. Must type the long ones up in an app before posting.
Mononoke,"Sam killed a White Walker to protect Gilly, which is super in character. Killing Dany isn’t. "
Mononoke,"> Because the metal rings around the star are real - part of the Propulsion system for the moving of the dyson sphere. The white walkers are a ghost in the nanomachine swarm that normally repairs the dyson sphere.

How high are you? I'm pretty sure this would go down as one of the worst-received endings in television history. Just the phrase ""dyson sphere"" being used in a ASOIAF discussion makes me wonder if *I'm* on drugs!"
Mononoke,She murdered his family. Its funny what pushes people over an edge. 
Mononoke,Dungeons & Dragons has always had a wrecked spaceship somewhere in it. Game of Thrones is basically GRR Martins D&D Campaign Setting.
Mononoke,"If you can find it, I'd recommend Monster. "
Mononoke,"Bebop is my #3 favorite anime of all time, but a lot of that has to do with nostalgia.

Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels, was the first time I think I ever saw real beauty in a movie/tv show/cartoon/etc.  The ""Green Bird"" scene is probably my favorite scene in anything ever, even though Bebop is my #3 anime.

The fact that the brief flashbacks we get during that scene is basically all the back story we ever get on Spike's past took me years to appreciate.  When the movie came out, I was so ready for a prequel-type flick that primarily focused on Spike's time in the crime syndicate.

What I got instead was a fun, long, random episode that takes place in the middle of the series.

Again, took my years to appreciate.

Even after I had come to love Bebop for everything it is, I found a video on YouTube called [Cowboy Bebop: The Meaning of Nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkXFBPGZpTM).  It's a little long, but it honestly helped me fall in love with the show all over again just by showing me the entire series in a new light I hadn't noticed before.

It also plays a buncha the OST.

Bebop is hands down my favorite soundtrack to anything.  Yoko Kanno is a flat out deity for what she pulled off with that series.

If you're looking for what to watch next, anime-wise, a lot of the recommendations here in the comments section are pretty good.

Bebop has a wider appeal, because it doesn't go too over the top zany anime wackiness, but it also doesn't go super violent mind fuckery.

I don't watch a whole lot of anime these days, but there are three that I can recommend to almost anyone.  

3.) Bebop
2.) Death Note
1.) Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood

I would definitely keep going in that order.  Death Note is a little more grounded (despite the concept of magic killing notebooks and Gods of Death) and is just probably the greatest game of cat and mouse between law enforcement and a serial killer I've ever seen.

It's around the same ballpark of episodes as Bebop (I wanna say 32?) and has a pretty finite ending and an *absolutely stellar* soundtrack.

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is my favorite story of all time in any medium, but there's a lot of over-the-top anime moments and magic powers and craziness.  I can't recommend anything higher to someone, but if you're just getting into anime and you need somewhere to go after Bebop, then yeah...

...Death Note all day.  You won't regret it."
Mononoke,Prince of Tennis is pretty good.
Mononoke,cowboy bebop is so great 
Mononoke,"The movie should have been a few episodes. It's definitely within the same chapter.,"
Mononoke,I've been meaning to watch through it however maybe check out deadman wonderland it's a dark little anime but it's so good also durararara is great as well
Mononoke,[removed]
Mononoke,"My siblings (oldest of five and 28/yo here) are super into anime and so is my boyfriend, so I recently watched my first two series! 
First was Sword Art Online. Loved the first season, the second one had some triggering content for me, so i stopped. 
But LET ME TELL YOU how much I ADORE Fairytale! I’m addicted. 😂"
Mononoke,if u want something completely different to see how varried anime can be check out pop team epic. 
Mononoke,"Welcome to the rabbit hole.

Also try out r/anime"
Mononoke,You should watch Samurai Champloo it's from the same director of Cowboy bebop
Mononoke,"love death note what about Inuyasha
stand alone complex, and full metal alchemist "
The Tatami Galaxy,"If you like time travel, check out Future Man on Hulu. It's Terminator meets Back to the Future meets The Last Starfighter meets a Seth Rogan comedy production. Josh Hutcherson is cast perfectly as the loser who is supposed to be a hero but is really just a loser with a conscious surrounded by a bunch of psychopaths. 

Along with The Great it's my favorite thing on Hulu."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Where are you that it's actually available on Disney+? I know Disney licensed it, but I didn't think it had even been released outside Japan at all yet."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Is this somehow related to the movie [""Summer time machine blues"" \(2005\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498567/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)? Because the plot synopsis sounds identical!

Anyway that movie is great, if the anime is as good as that movie it'll be a blast. Thanks for the heads up!"
The Tatami Galaxy,"12 Monkeys

Also, Misfits has one of the best self-contained time travel episodes ever. Both shows are on Hulu."
The Tatami Galaxy,Wolf has such a great character arc across the 3 seasons.
The Tatami Galaxy,"aha! this must be why my American-self can't find this on disney+

thanks."
The Tatami Galaxy,[deleted]
The Tatami Galaxy,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
The Tatami Galaxy,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
The Tatami Galaxy,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
The Tatami Galaxy,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
The Tatami Galaxy,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
The Tatami Galaxy,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
The Tatami Galaxy,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
The Tatami Galaxy,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
The Tatami Galaxy,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
The Tatami Galaxy,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
The Tatami Galaxy,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
The Tatami Galaxy,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
The Tatami Galaxy,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
The Tatami Galaxy,🙂💕
The Tatami Galaxy,It’s great but it’s depressing.
The Tatami Galaxy,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
The Tatami Galaxy,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
The Tatami Galaxy,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
The Tatami Galaxy,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
The Tatami Galaxy,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
The Tatami Galaxy,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
The Tatami Galaxy,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
The Tatami Galaxy,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
The Tatami Galaxy,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
The Tatami Galaxy,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
The Tatami Galaxy,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
The Tatami Galaxy,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
The Tatami Galaxy,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
The Tatami Galaxy,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
The Tatami Galaxy,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
The Tatami Galaxy,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
The Tatami Galaxy,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
The Tatami Galaxy,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
The Tatami Galaxy,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

The Tatami Galaxy,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
The Tatami Galaxy,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
The Tatami Galaxy,Needs more Jojo
The Tatami Galaxy,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
The Tatami Galaxy,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
The Tatami Galaxy,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
The Tatami Galaxy,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
The Tatami Galaxy,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
The Tatami Galaxy,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
The Tatami Galaxy,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
The Tatami Galaxy,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
The Tatami Galaxy,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
The Tatami Galaxy,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
The Tatami Galaxy,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show

The Tatami Galaxy,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
The Tatami Galaxy,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
The Tatami Galaxy,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
The Tatami Galaxy,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
The Tatami Galaxy,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
The Tatami Galaxy,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
The Tatami Galaxy,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
The Tatami Galaxy,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
The Tatami Galaxy,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
The Tatami Galaxy,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
The Tatami Galaxy,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol

The Tatami Galaxy,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
The Tatami Galaxy,Black Clover?
The Tatami Galaxy,.
The Tatami Galaxy,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
The Tatami Galaxy,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
The Tatami Galaxy,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
The Tatami Galaxy,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
The Tatami Galaxy,[deleted]
The Tatami Galaxy,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
The Tatami Galaxy,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
The Tatami Galaxy,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
The Tatami Galaxy,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
The Tatami Galaxy,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
The Tatami Galaxy,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
The Tatami Galaxy,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."

Imagine eating a heart stopper beef burger replicated and it’s only a 100 calories, total, with all the necessary vitamins and minerals increased to your specifications, and you don’t gain a pound.

Marvels Iron Fist,Goddamn this hurts. Is this the worst reviewed Netflix original so far?
Marvels Iron Fist,I still can't believe Scott Buck landed the job of show runner on this show after what happened with Dexter.
Marvels Iron Fist,I had a bad feeling about this show once Scott Buck (who was responsible for the worst seasons of Dexter) was hired on as showrunner. Guess my fears have now been vindicated. :(
Marvels Iron Fist,"**33/100** on metacritic from 5 reviews. Things aren't looking good at all.

I feel sorry for Finn Jones as well. I was hoping after GOT he'd be able to use that as a solid platform"
Marvels Iron Fist,"Don't worry, Armond White will certify it fresh and bump it up to 15%"
Marvels Iron Fist,Great. I don't know why they bothered to separate Luke Cage and Iron Fist anyway. I personally think it would have made more sense to put them together for Heroes for Hire. Problem is they drag out these shows anyway so the pacing is never perfect all the way through. I'm still in the middle of Luke Cage and I'll finish it eventually but it's just not overly exciting/interesting.
Marvels Iron Fist,"I was so god damned hyped for this show.

I love Iron Fist. I play him in Marvel Heroes.

Is this the first time an MCU show or film has gotten a poor review?"
Marvels Iron Fist,"When something people are excited about gets absolutely rave reviews, on RT or in general, I'd love to know the percentage who then say ""well, RT is unreliable, I'll just wait and judge it for myself.""

It's almost like people are more inclined to believe the reviews they want to believe. 

ETA -- you don't have to explain why you use RT in general. My point was that people don't have to announce that they are skeptical of a critical consensus they disagree with. We get it."
Marvels Iron Fist,Never thought I'd see the day that a MCU property would fail critically. How fucking weird would it be if Wonder Woman got good reviews? 
Marvels Iron Fist,"I'll still watch it. Critic's opinions seem to rarely seem to be representative of my own after I watch something. Luke Cage has a 96% on RT, and I didn't love it. "
Marvels Iron Fist,At this rate r/ironfist is gonna turn into /r/arrow 
Marvels Iron Fist,"I think the problem is Netflix is making things that should be movies stretch out to 10 episodes and there just isn't enough content for 10 hours of fucking show to use. 

Luke Cage was a fucking killer show for the first 3 episodes and then fucking dragged on like a dead dog behind a lawn mower on the highway. It was just boring and the number of times they kept referencing older things like ""pops"" every 5 minutes. 

If Netflix would make these into 2-3 hour movies I think they'd be insane, but 10 episodes is just too much."
Marvels Iron Fist,[deleted]
Marvels Iron Fist,"The showrunner is a hack, so I don't doubt that it's not a good show.  

But I'm also in the minority who hasn't thought any of the Marvel Netflix shows were great or anything.  I feel like they're really raking this over the coals when there's no way it can be that significantly worse than the second half of Luke Cage.  Or even how stupid Daredevil became when it boiled down to Daredevil vs. Ninjas any time the plot started to drag.  "
Marvels Iron Fist,I just hope they don't fuck up 'the punisher'. 
Marvels Iron Fist,This has got to be embarrassing for Marvel. This is not only the first poorly reviewed product they've had (Thor 2 and Age of Ultron are still fresh) but it's also the lead in to Defenders. 
Marvels Iron Fist,"Honestly. I stopped watching Luke Cage half trough. It got high ratings, and i agree acting and directing was not bad at all.

But story about superhero that has strength and invulnerability level of superman. But needs 12 episodes to take down street corner gang. Because why ? He dont want to fight them hands on, but wear them down - make them leave crime by them selves ( out boredom ). And only risk in the whole series is that he is sometimes careless, since the approach to any fight is ""Fuck, i just walk in and swing - since nothing can hurt me""

"
Marvels Iron Fist,I guess people weren't interested in Bruce Wayne Clone #4
Marvels Iron Fist,"The tomato to score representation makes zero sense. No one scored below a 6/10. No one scored higher than a 6.5/10. Two scores of 6/10 are fresh, all the others, including the 6.5/10, are rotten.

The scores mean nothing and someone at rotten tomatoes gets to make it whatever they want?"
Marvels Iron Fist,"Just gonna be honest, both seasons of *Daredevil* and *Jessica Jones* were incredibly well-written, with great characterization and morally complex villains. I excitedly re-watched both of them almost immediately after watching them the first time.

But *Luke Cage* was **weak**: Sub-par writing, boring characters, laughably cartoon-ish villains, deus ex machina galore, and beat-you-over-the-head-with-Harlem culture. Some it was likely intentional as an ode to early blaxploitation films, and I respect that, but all-in-all I struggled to get through the one season and don't think I could give it a re-watch anytime soon, if at all. The best part was Claire Temple's arc *by far*.

Just being honest, and this is purely my opinion -- others may feel differently.

But hearing about Iron Fist receiving such low marks makes my stomach drop. I can't imagine it being much more sub-par than Luke Cage and a 14% on Rotten Tomatoes does not bode well. I won't judge it until I see it, but daggum..."
Marvels Iron Fist,Not sure if bad or if people on the internet are just whining that the show is relatively faithful to the source material...
Marvels Iron Fist,"I watch these other ones because I'm loyal to my man DD.  He swept me off my feet with his gorgeous hallway ass kicking and I've been his ever since.  If I have to watch 18 hours of shit tier Marvel characters to make him happy, so be it."
Marvels Iron Fist,The only hope is that the second half is amazing but man that is a long hope.
Marvels Iron Fist,I am not surprised. Marvel Netflix is not some majestic being that is flawless. Very far from it. The main criticism is that the show is super slow/boring and with barely any action. That does not seem like a criticism you can just pull out of nowhere. If there is no action - there is no action and that is just terrible. No two ways about it. I 100% believe that this show could be absolutely terrible.
Marvels Iron Fist,"If you want to watch a good marvel series.
Watch agents of shield.
Start of season 1 is cheesy as fuck.
But the quality has done NOTHING but improve since season 2.

The latest season is some really quality writing and story driven episodes.
None of the OMG Who is the bad guy find out in 16 episodes time shit you get with flash  or  arrow/
They literally are closing storys left and right and leave a new one open.

The LMD arc was AMAZINGLY well done and the show does a decent job of making you keep guesing who the bad guy is that's pretty hard to do in todays world

Marvels Iron Fist,"The reviews of the top 3 critics in the OP's link, all whine about the protagonist being a white guy, cultural appropriation, and note this as part of the negatives.

To me this means that based on my criteria of what is a good television, it is probably better than the score implies, but not necessarilly good. In short, they judge as negatives things that I don't see as negative, and at worse, this puts into question their value system as extreme. 

Personally I understand complaints to a degree when it comes to way to excessive patterns, but I don't sympathise with those complaining about the one marvel series with a rich white dude protagonist and I rarely see validity in complaints about appropriation.  Diversity is about having a variety of perspectives, including of those with not majority race, not about hating on white protagonists. We need a more moderate perspective by critics.

Anyway, that issue aside, I doubt this is a good television series. Even if it was good, these critics would still have complained about ""white guy/cultural appropriation"", but maybe it would be praised on doing other stuff well. 

My expectations is that it isn't  good, but probably not 14% rotten score awful. Without the complaints about those issues, which is clear is part of their evaluation criteria, it would be better regarded. But it would probably still be rotten.

Might be the one netflix marvel series I would skip from watching, unless I see positive reaction by fans.  This doesn't mean 100% praise, something similar or a bit worse than the reaction I saw from people about Luke Cage would qualify to me, that this is a series that might be worth watching. I liked the other ones, flaws and all, so if it is at all decent I would probably see it."
Marvels Iron Fist,Critics are like weathermen. Sure I'll listen but if I want to know if it's raining out I'll just open the door and look for myself thanks.
Marvels Iron Fist,As soon as I saw Finn Jones as Danny Rand I knew it had potential to be awful. I hope it's a decent show but RT is usually reliable. 
Marvels Iron Fist,It was at 9% when I looked yesterday so this is actually an improvement LOL
Marvels Iron Fist,"Everyone here is shitting on it but no one has seen it yet. I'm still gonna watch, can't wait to binge."
Marvels Iron Fist,I worry it's because the story is like...old school white washing. Iron Fist's origin is...dated. I'm still excited for the show.
Marvels Iron Fist,"Just personally chiming in... I couldn't get into S2 of Daredevil after binging the first one. Bailed on Luke Cage halfway through. I'd watch Krysten Ritter read the phone book so S2 of Jessica Jones is it for me. I won't even bother to check this one out. Good isn't even ""good enough"" for me these days and this thing id DOA bad. There's tons of good tv out there right now so something has to be really above and beyond great to keep me tuned in."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Not surprised considering this is the same guy who turned Dexter into a lumberjack. JJ is the best, followed by DD season 1,  Lukcage and DD season 2 tying since both fell apart during the second half of the season. Lmao at DC TV shows > MC TV shows. There's no way in hell Arrow, Flash, Supergirl etc is better than any of Netflix's Marvel shows besides Iron Fist.  Legion is where it's at when it's all said and done lol"
Marvels Iron Fist,I'm thinking about just skipping this show entirely 
Marvels Iron Fist,"I came to this sub after seeing the teaser... it gave me a bad feeling and came to ask ppl: this thread isn't making me feel any better :(     

The story seems basically the same as Luke Cage and Daredevil; how many people mob bosses can rule New York simultaneously? If this series has crooked cops and an evil guy making the protagonist seem like a vigilante/terrorist to the public eye, I'm giving up on Marvel "
Marvels Iron Fist,"It's only the first six episodes.  People sucked Luke Cage's dick when the first six episodes were out (and even after it was fully released), but I believe that show is a pile of garbage (so many logical flaws from characters and story-telling standpoints that I would give it a 14%).  I'm going to wait and see; I don't trust other people after Luke Cage."
Marvels Iron Fist,"This is the delay in true ratings that seems to exist. Luke Cage should have received much lower ratings than it did; 96% when it should have been more like 70%. Critics went overboard and gave it too much praise and when people watched it they got annoyed at the critics for not giving an accurate review. Now critics overcompensate by completely tanking this one because they're morons. Their reviews aren't honest opinions, they're just trying to predict what people will think of the show so that they can keep their job. Another problem with trusting the ratings is that most critics review 1 to 4 episodes before putting out a judgement on a 13 episode series. Who the hell watches 10 minutes of a movie and then puts out their review? It makes no sense at all. "
Marvels Iron Fist,"Sucks that all Marvel shows have gotten progressively worse since DareDevil season 1 came out (this includes Agent Carter, which I loved)."
Marvels Iron Fist,The Netflix Marvel shows have been dropping in quality since DD season 1 ended. JJ suffered from lazy writing and terribly plotting and DD season 2 was the Karen Page/Punisher show. I can't comment on Luke Cage as i wasn't able to get past episode 4. It appears that Iron Fist may be a perfect storm of all the issues that the previous show have had.
Marvels Iron Fist,[deleted]
Marvels Iron Fist,"Awe...winning streak had to end somewhere I guess. They are not perfect, but theres been at least one great thing i have liked about Marvel's Netflix shows.. but this looks like the end of that."
Marvels Iron Fist,"It kind of sucks to see the same thing happen with Marvel TV that happened with the movies. After a while, they all blend together and seem so boring because the stakes can't get higher, and origin stories can only vary so much before they start to repeat themselves or get too inaccessible."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Just watched the trailer since people were saying it looked pretty bad, I thought it looked like it could be good (like a melee form of the green arrow). The main actor didn't look horrible (I wasn't a fan of the female lead). Overall hoping it plays out well, as I would enjoy a new show to bingewatch."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Watched the trailer...blandest lead I've ever seen.
"
Marvels Iron Fist,0/10 worst live action adaption of One Punch Man ever. 
Marvels Iron Fist,"For the first 6 episodes out of 13, let's remember."
Marvels Iron Fist,the netflix marvel shows had a steady decline in quality but holy shit this looks extreme. 
Marvels Iron Fist,"these marvel tv shows have always perplexed me.  I'm a big marvel movies fan, but i've found every single marvel tv series with the exception of daredevil to be basically unwatchable.  I feel like i'm watching some low budget childrens' adventure show with a target audience of 6-10 years old with absolutely horrible acting and writing that will go unnoticed by children who will be dazzled by the idea of kids with super powers.  Yet, aside from ironfist, they all have high ratings on rottentomatoes..."
Marvels Iron Fist,"I think Marvel is going a bit too nuts on their superhero shows on Netflix, it was only a matter of time before quality was going to really slip...and this was apparently it.  Personally I think Luke Cage was not a very good show either, and Jessica Jones was merely OK.  The only reason I finished JJ was the villain was good and different."
Marvels Iron Fist,"All I wanted was to see Danny rand rip the heart out of a dragon. 

IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?!

Also why is daredevil the only Netflix series with decent fight stunts? Jessica jones went out of at way to obfuscate the fights. And Luke cage's fights were almost boring because of their one sidedness. 
"
Marvels Iron Fist,"Daredevil has been awesome, but Jessica Jones and Luke Cage were pretty mediocre if you ask me (Luke Cage's third act in particular.) Now Iron Fist is a dud, I just really hope they don't fuck up Punisher."
Marvels Iron Fist,I'll still be watching 
Marvels Iron Fist,"Well, the train had to stop sooner or later."
Marvels Iron Fist,It's a bit suspicious that nearly all the critical reviews focus on the casting of a white male lead as a problem.
Marvels Iron Fist,"I mean, it is the Verge so I don't know what I expected but what the hell kind of a racist/click-baity title is this?! 

http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14848336/iron-fist-review-netflix-show-marvel

"
Marvels Iron Fist,Funny how 90% of those reviews are just whining about non-issues like Danny being played by a white guy.
Marvels Iron Fist,"If a critic didn't like the show, fair enough but I've seen a lot of mainstream outlets saying that the show ""suffers from a white lead"". As if the show is worse off somehow simply because the actor is white, not even considering his acting ability.

I really dislike these critics who seem to put their social justice criteria checklist first when evaluation the quality of a show instead of the actual content being presented. "
Marvels Iron Fist,How have people seen this already?
Marvels Iron Fist,"I kinda felt like this would happen eventually. There are hundreds of marvel heroes, and we have already started to scrape the bottom of the barrel with Jessica Jones and Luke Cage. They are legit heroes, and Netflix did a good job with both of them. But in terms of revenue? They were on marvel's low side. Like the aqua-man of DC low. Combine that with Netflix rapid expansion here and overseas, the metric ton of shows they have in the pipe, they were bound to drop the ball eventually. I thought Luke cage was going to be garbage, but it turned out pretty dope. If they fuck up punisher, the shit will really hit the fan. 

But it's interesting to see a show of this hype fail before it starts. The same stuff happens on big networks constantly. Should we be surprised? "
Marvels Iron Fist,Thanks Trump. 
Marvels Iron Fist,"I've seen so many reviews talking about how Iron Fist should've been an Asian American actor, and most of the reviewers think appropriation of Asian Culture is the worst aspect in the show. I will reserve any judgement until I actually watch the show, and I'm sure it suffers from problems just as Luke Cage did. Though I doubt it will be shitty enough to deserve 14%, and will be worth watching for crucial Defenders setup. Most of the people reviewing Iron Fist need to stop being so PC."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Oh no, SJW critics who have been throwing tantrums for months because they clearly never read the comics still don't like it?! I am stunned by this! No, wait, the opposite. 

I believe I shall watch it and make my own decision."
Marvels Iron Fist,"I will wait to see it myself before I judge but it's worth noting...Jessica Jones got rave reviews but it was very lack lustered at times, Luke Cage got great reviews and it was flat out boring at times for me personally.

So who knows."
Marvels Iron Fist,"i'm concerned, but i'll still go into it as open minded as I can. i wasn't looking forward to iron fist that much anyway really, it's more something to tide me over until Guardians and Defenders."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Honestly, this is encouraging. They've successfully been turning more obscure characters into successful movies and shows, and (after not being impressed by Daredevil) I was worried they've only been popular due to the Marvel brand. At least now we know for sure these things are being looked at critically, and aren't just a cash-grab.

I mean, they're still a cash-grab.."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Yeah it's meh, with the whole Scott buck thing, but "" critic "" reviews on RT are usually pretty shit."
Marvels Iron Fist,I choose not to follow rotten tomatoes or any other review site people like what they like I don't need a rejected movie director or failed reviewer to tell me what to watch and what not to watch......sorry not sorry
Marvels Iron Fist,"Ugh makes me so sad. Was really look forward to this, and I'm worried it'll derail the hype for the Defenders"
Marvels Iron Fist,One of the shows had to flop at some point.  Not all comic oriented TV shows and movies will be Avengers and Agents of Shield/Heroes.
Marvels Iron Fist,The trailer looked so cheesy and the way they portrayed the story did not interest me. 
Marvels Iron Fist,I told all of the fucking naysayers it was going to bomb the day the trailer came out for it. 
Marvels Iron Fist,"Well...it was bound to happen sometime, I for one hope this is a wake up call for Disney and friends, don't get me wrong I like Disney and have enjoyed most of what they've done but they make too much money with cookie cutter characters with very little depth. "
Marvels Iron Fist,"God damn, this was the one i wanted to watch the most."
Marvels Iron Fist,Is anyone else really scared that Scott Buck is going to ruin Inhumans? It keeps me up at night...
Marvels Iron Fist,"From the trailer it looks like it could be interesting, don't always listen to some reviews as everyones different. Thought it was going to follow ghostbusters with a gender reversal of all characters or change ethnicity of the main character like the fantastic four reboot just to please some people who don't read the comics and likely never will. Going to watch it to give it a chance."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Blizzard's Doom Fist: 100% on PTR

Marvels Iron Fist,Scott Buck making a shitty show? No. Way.
Marvels Iron Fist,This is how I would rate most of marvels recent films
Marvels Iron Fist,This is sad to see but I bet that it's gonna rise a lot after a while.
Marvels Iron Fist,RIP Scott Buck's Undead Career for good
Marvels Iron Fist,D.C. Netflix is shitting on Marval Netflix
Marvels Iron Fist,"This bums me out, this is the show I've been waiting for ever since netflix announced they were doing the marvel shows. That's been what 4 years now, and I'm hearing it's the worst of the bunch. Man I really hope I like it at the very least."
Marvels Iron Fist,Are these real poor reviews or people whining about cultural appropriation?
Marvels Iron Fist,Basically the show Arrow. Minus the Arrows. 
Marvels Iron Fist,"Who cares what others think about the series. If you like it, you like it."
Marvels Iron Fist,"We'll see.  I have a feeling that most of these reviews are negative because they don't like the idea of cultural appropriation, which means they also don't understand the character of Danny Rand in the first place."
Marvels Iron Fist,This means nothing.
Marvels Iron Fist,So its an CW dc super hero show?
Marvels Iron Fist,"I'm not holding any judgement until it comes out, but these reviews are making me lower my expectations. RT is often critical of TV so I will take with a grain of salt and so should others.

Edit: Downvote me, I stick by my opinion. Seems like you can't have one these days."
Marvels Iron Fist,"Boy, negative reviews by critics couldn't have anything to do with the anti-whitewashing/white savior uproar could it?  It seems to me that critics often are heavily influenced by racial protesting. 

I'll watch and see for myself. "
Marvels Iron Fist,"This looks like an unbiased review ""Given that he's still the one person capable of taking up the Iron Fist mantle, it's hard to decouple his whiteness from his elevated position. But the show's race problems are intertwined with other nagging issues."" "
Marvels Iron Fist,"The whole concept of Iron Fist is just sooooooooooo, so borring. White American billionaire being the chosen so and so of a mystic far eastern cult.

[fingerdownthroat.gif]

Danny Rand only works as the juxtapositioned sidekick and bromance subject of Power Man. He should never ever have had his own show."
Marvels Iron Fist,"This is actually retarded. The show isn't even out yet. People are forming opinions based on a handful of ""critics"" who saw maybe 6/13 episodes? By and large, TV and film critics are the kind of ""experts"" whose opinion I trust *less* than an average person."
Marvels Iron Fist,"The Rotten Tomatoes Metric has never been anything I've put much stock in. It's an aggregate of yes/no answers. If every reviewer thinks its just slightly below average, and gives it a no, then it gets a 0% score. 

I'll wait and judge it for myself."
Marvels Iron Fist,Not politically motivated at all.
Marvels Iron Fist,"after the literally years-long twitter campaign against any form of this show with a white lead, it's safe to say any crowdsourced review score will be as reliable as an American election poll"
Marvels Iron Fist,"having actually read these Reviews one thing is increasingly obvious. It's fucking bullshit. The majority of them's fault is either Danny being white or bitching about identity politics and race. Or them saying it isnt as good as the other netflix shows, or it's somehow unoriginal or cliche. It's a kung fu series, what the fuck do you honestly expect? This is nothing but people looking down their noses at something because their expectations were either too high or they're too racist to see past danny being white (which he is in the fucking comics)"
Marvels Iron Fist,"I hate to be the one that says this, but there was a lot of SJW backlash becuase the main character is white doing asian martial arts (becuase they never picked up a Iron Fist comic). i wouldnt be surprise if this got bad reviews for the same reason ghostbusters got good reviews. "
Marvels Iron Fist,"So there's this:

""Given that he's still the one person capable of taking up the Iron Fist mantle, it's hard to decouple his whiteness from his elevated position. But the show's race problems are intertwined with other nagging issues.""

Now, what value does that provide...? What sort of commentary is THAT? 

Decoupling his whiteness from his elevated position? The show's race problems? Gimme a fucking break. 

Thinking that the people who review these TV shows obviously don't read (or even do cursory research) on the comic books that served as inspiration... but I'm willing to bet money that these assholes will end up submitting positive reviews for the [musical episode of Supergirl.](http://comicbook.com/dc/2017/03/10/the-flash-supergirl-musical-crossover-plot-cast-roles/)

I can see it now: ""Musical superhero episodes a refreshing triumph of original storytelling"" or some such bullshit.  

I fucking hate musicals. "
Marvels Iron Fist,"Not surprised, for whatever reason, none of the Netflix Marvel series beyond DD have really grabbed me.

Julies Greenroom,Thanks for this! Very impressive work.
Julies Greenroom,"Amazing work and fascinating read!

Question, is that last list Oscar winners making their series regular television debut or did you include those who are returning as well? Because your description reads like the former but includes actors that are returning to tv."
Julies Greenroom,Am I missing Sam Rockwell in F is for Family? I love him as the voice of Vic!
Julies Greenroom,"Thank you! The last list does include actors who have starred in a TV show before but the main idea is that these actors haven’t starred in a TV show after winning an Oscar. Furthermore, all these actors don’t have any experience in the current state of television (aka Peak TV since the last five years).
So for example, Brie Larson starred in United States of Tara on Showtime but that was way before her Oscar win and also before television became as big as it is now."
Julies Greenroom,"You're absolutely right, I didn't know Sam Rockwell has a main role in that show. I will add him to the list!"
Julies Greenroom,"You're absolutely right, I didn't know Sam Rockwell has a main role in that show. I will add him to the list! Do you know any other actors with a TV role?"
Julies Greenroom,"Larson was one of the ones I was thinking, but Holly Hunter also started in a tv show (Saving Grace on TNT) after her Oscar (though not during peak TV).

Edit: I forgot, she was also in Here & Now on HBO last year."

Samurai Gourmet,"I need more seasons of this show. Like, at least fifty more. It reminds me of the introductory segments they had on Iron Chef Japan, where they would have a little documentary about the challenger. And that old man is just so endearing! And the samurai parts aren't hokey or anything, they're done really well."
Samurai Gourmet,"Just started this oh my gosh I don't know what is it about it. I mean there's nothing, nothing, a retiree is just eating, nothing happens really, and yet I feel so happy watching it and living vicariously through the old dude experiencing mundane things for the first time I'm ready to stick with it until I end this season!"
Samurai Gourmet,"I was casually browsing Netflix and was drawn by its interesting title. I was so surprised that Netflix got such big names to star in this wacky but cute show!  竹中直人and 鈴木保奈美 are household names in Asia, but I had never seen their work. I can relate to Kasumi a lot because I'm a foodie too. The role also reminds me so much of the grandpa and father of Crayon Shinchan. I've watched 5 episodes already. I really enjoy the acting of 竹中直人. I wish his wife had more screen time and wasn't just a stereotypical Japanese housewife though."
Samurai Gourmet,"I stumbled onto the show after a period of melancholy. The characters and setting were so upbeat and lovely, it pulled me out of it. I hope Netflix produces more of these type of shows! A great catch!"
Samurai Gourmet,"Does anyone know of any other similar shows? I really dig how light and effortless this show to watch while basically being like food porn with a plot 
"
Samurai Gourmet,"There are two fun things that made the show even better for me:

1) Naoto Takanaka who plays Shimizu. He's one of my favorite actors and most may remember for his classic turn in the original "" Shall We Dance?"" movie where he played the repressed office nerd who is secretly a Latin dance master. 

2). The restaurants he goes to are actual places in Tokyo using their real names so it is actually a bit of surreptitious advertising for the establishments that are shown. He does bounce around Tokyo in rather unrealistic ways but if you're unaware of where things are it doesn't distract.  "
Samurai Gourmet,"It's such a chill little show, perfect to watch while I'm eating. There are few characters but they're all so likeable. I'm really a fan of the japanese netflix originals, like good morning call or atelier."
Samurai Gourmet,"This show is so cute, I found myself cheering when the old man ordered his beer! "
Samurai Gourmet,I've watched a few episodes now. I think this has to be the most relaxing and feel good show I've ever seen. 
Samurai Gourmet,"I really like this show.  The food was amazing and there were some really funny moments.

However, with that being said, did any one else find it strange that a 60 year old man was so self-conscious and still cared so much about what other people thought of him?  Is that just a Japanese thing?  It just bothered me a lot for some reason.  I'm 26 right now and it seems the older I get the less fucks I seem to give about what people think of me.  When I'm 60 I'll probably just be walking around naked and yelling profanities at people just to fuck with them!

Also, his wife is definitely cheating on him.  Who the hell has dinner with their ""yoga instructors""?! "
Samurai Gourmet,"I just finished the whole season. I hope Netflix follows this up right away with season 2! 

I can relate to Takeshi. He's very much like me: loves food, initially indecisive, hesitant at times but gotta brave it out in the end. Lol"
Samurai Gourmet,Does anyone know what brand of instant ramen he eats?  Can you get it in America?
Samurai Gourmet,"When I was in Japan for a couple of months, there was a show on TV with similar storytelling. A guy eating food at different places, contemplating life. I don't remember the name of it, but it seems to be a popular theme over there. Samurai gourmet is very much like that show, but much higher production value. I like it. "
Samurai Gourmet,"Absolutely loved this show! Each episode was short and sweet with occasional overtones of euphoria and nostalgic delight. The music was very mind soothing as well. Every time he took a bite, I could feel the joy. Plus I loved the rugged wit of his samurai alter ego "
Samurai Gourmet,"I told some friends about this series. They looked at me with a raised eyebrow, probably wondering what I found so special about 15-minute episodes of a retired man who spends his days eating at restaurants.

And I don't blame them, lol. I would probably think the same in their place. It's all about simplicity, it's something you have to watch to understand. There's absolutely NOTHING big about it. Yet I finished every episode with a smile.

We're not used to this sort of shows..."
Samurai Gourmet,"I just started this because it looked like a samurai movie and reminded me of the anime Toriko, which I loved.  It's pretty much the complete opposite but it's so relaxing and endearing. I am loving it! If I had known exactly what kind of show it was, I probably never would have tried it. I'm so glad I did. 
"
Samurai Gourmet,"So glad I decided to watch this random show that popped up while browsing. I watched all 12 episodes in one day. It is difficult to explain to others what it's about, but I have managed to get several hooked already. I'm going to Japan next week and beyond excited to eat...and eat.

P.S. and eat"
Samurai Gourmet,"My wife and I recently discovered this show! It's reawakening my joys for the simple things in life.

It's very basic but there's is something that's so touching about the innocence of it."
Samurai Gourmet,"In all honesty, this is one of the best shows I've seen in awhile. It's at the perfect length to suit the quirky premise on each episode. There's something very relaxing about how Takeshi enjoys things we take for granted. I work in a boring, grind filled office job so seeing this show is quite healing."
Samurai Gourmet,A [joyful part](http://imgur.com/a/iL5T2) of the show
Samurai Gourmet,"I'm super late to the party as of this post. 

I like getting buzzed and looking for things to watch. I fell into this series and (as of right now in the middle of ep 6) I absolutely adore it!

I think alot of American (and maybe a lot of western) media is very good at specific things, namely well planned comedy or drama series. Thing is, as some have pointed out, these illicit just a few types of reactions. I need to find more series like this, japanese live action to anime to otherwise, that play so well on emotion, that aren't afraid to be cheesy and fantastic to also be endearing.

Endearing, honest, emotive. Thats the key I think. That's what I want to find. More media that, while it MAY play on a solid 3 act structure, isn't afraid to bend the reality to be completely endearing to a specific mood."
Samurai Gourmet,"It's based on a Japanese manga with the same name.
 I highly recommend that as well as this adaption.
"
Samurai Gourmet,"It's an awesome little slice of Japanese culture. However, does anyone know who or what (and why) they say thank you to at the beginning of a meal?"
Samurai Gourmet,"This show makes me feel so warm inside, love it!"
Samurai Gourmet,"I love this show!

If you finished this and want to watch something similar (and I think just as good) check out Kodoku no Gurume (The Lonely Gourmet). You can find it online if you look hard enough. It's wonderful."
Samurai Gourmet,"Fantastic series. It's reeeeally easy-going and full of lessons on nostalgia and growing old. My main concern is that it's very Japanese in the sense that it reflects patriarchal and close to racist (episode 2) values. However I did fucking cry in the finale when I saw his face after [spoiler](#s ""finding the pictures of him and his wife together before they had even met. I just got this ""together-in-previous-lives"" feeling. "")"
Samurai Gourmet,"Binged it. I wish I liked shitty food as much as that guy does. When he actually eats GOOD food, I'm all the more jealous. Those facial expressions <3 Where do I get a ""hashed beef rice""? It looks like some sort of curry."
Samurai Gourmet,"I want to love this show but the second episode kinda offended me and even if the rest of the series is not like that, supporting a show that has subtle Racism just doesn't seem right. I've been to japan and love Japanese culture in general but i just can't watch this show even though i know i would probably love every other episode "
Samurai Gourmet,"I absolutely love this.
It watches like an anime with the odd reality swaps and the inner monologue. 

Reminds me of Food Wars with how much they make me want good food. "
Samurai Gourmet,"I watched the first 5 episodes so far, and I'm really enjoying it!"
Samurai Gourmet,Does anyone know where the show is filmed?
Samurai Gourmet,A gem. The simple beauty of life. Thank you for this food.
Samurai Gourmet,"My favorite show! Relaxing, fun, and it has lead me on a path to healthier eating!"
Samurai Gourmet,People who enjoyed this show should look into Midnight Diner on Netflix.
Samurai Gourmet,"I've been binging on this show too. I love it's quiet little storylines, and I think I kinda have a crush on the samurai warrior...  One thing I keep noticing is how Kasumi's wife is always trotting about, like this little running thing she does with mincing steps just to go a few feet within their house. What's that about?"
Samurai Gourmet,Anyone know where you can get the soundtrack? I like the idea of listening to it while cooking.
Samurai Gourmet,"I love this show, so chilled 👌"
Samurai Gourmet,Best TV series I've seen this year!
Samurai Gourmet,"I just watched the finale. I was hoping to find a small and vocal minority of fellow fans and voila! I'm glad I'm not the only one who loved this show for it's simplicity. 

I may or may not have also cried at how amazing the last two episodes were. Very heartfelt :) "
Samurai Gourmet,this show rules
Samurai Gourmet,"Try out the film Sweet Bean, too. It evokes all the same pleasures and satisfactions."
Samurai Gourmet,"I was telling my wife about it. I said ""It's honestly a little goofy at times, but I can't stop watching it."" There's something about the guy that's so interesting. Plus, I like watching the different culinary cultures from what we have in the US. It's a good show overall."
Samurai Gourmet,"Yes, the very Marcel Proust-ish idea is amazingly enjoyable. "
Samurai Gourmet,"As far as I can tell Netflix didn't produce or commission the show, they're just distributing it is all.  "
Samurai Gourmet,"Wakako-zake is about a young office girl drinking and eating (mostly) alone, there are 2 seasons and an anime all of which are on Crunchyroll. Kodoku no Gurume (the Solitary Gourmet) is by the same writer as Samurai Gourmet and is very similar but with a middle aged business man, there are 5 seasons and a couple specials I think they are all on KissAsian to stream for free. Midnight Diner might also interest you but it's more drama less food porn (imagine Coronation Street in a Japanese diner)."
Samurai Gourmet,"Don't know if you're specifically looking for Japanese shows like this one, but a couple of Western ones I'd recommend that are in a similar vein, are Chef's Table, and I'll Have What Phil's Having."
Samurai Gourmet,"Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories is another fictional Japanese food-related show on Netflix. The majority of each episode is more about little character-driven drama stories than about the food at the diner, but there's still a dish that each episode focuses on and is given a *bit* of the spotlight."
Samurai Gourmet,Try Terrace House? It's not about food though. But it's also on Netflix.
Samurai Gourmet,"Sweet Bean, a film. On Netflix. A quiet, satisfying pleasure."
Samurai Gourmet,竹中直人 is so good on the show his expressions kill me
Samurai Gourmet,"> Is that just a Japanese thing?

Pretty much, yes. The Japanese are all about ""saving face"" and self-consciousness."
Samurai Gourmet,"That level of self-consciousness is a Japanese thing and no, his wife isn't cheating on him. She actually represents the ideal modern housewife who doesn't just stay at home. 

The main actor, Naoto Takenaka, excels in portraying the reserved salaryman who must break out of his self-imposed shell. Watch the original ""Shall We Dance"" to see how hilarious he can make this. 

"
Samurai Gourmet,"I've actually known Japanese friends who ended up getting coffee and/or meals with people that they receive services from, like their hairstylist or in this case, their yoga instructor. Not all that uncommon."
Samurai Gourmet,"Japan has a very strict ""shaming"" culture where they are basically scolded since birth by parents, teachers, bosses etc.
It might seem strange to westerners, but once you've consumed enough of their media, you get used to it."
Samurai Gourmet,I finished most of the episodes (saving the last one) and I can't help but ask whether there's gonna be a big revelation that the wife is cheating on him even though it'll go against the tone of the show. Why is she always ditching the husband for yoga related hangouts? Is it because the writer needs to give him an excuse to dine alone? There is also zero physical intimacy between them. Maybe the magazine about divorce was foreshadowing 
Samurai Gourmet,is that his wife or daughter?
Samurai Gourmet,Kodoku no Gurume!!
Samurai Gourmet,"This should answer your question:
[link!](https://gurunavi.com/en/japanfoodie/2015/11/phrases.html?__ngt__=TT0cf0051ca001ac1e4ac33e7_abzYob_lL4OYetUsl3Ag)"
Samurai Gourmet,"I forget, what is that racist moment?"
Samurai Gourmet,"Loving Japanese culture means having to grapple with the fact that these attitudes are pervasive, and oftentimes even less subtle in presentation. "
Samurai Gourmet,"Loving Japanese culture means having to grapple with the fact that these attitudes are pervasive, and oftentimes even less subtle in presentation. "
Samurai Gourmet,"All over Tokyo. What is interesting is that all the restaurants shown are real places using their real names and real menus. Some well-known actors stand in for the staff though. 

The locations are spread around in ways that are unrealistic. In the Oden wedding anniversary episode for example the husband and wife meet up and shop in Jiyugaoka, then supposedly walk to the restaurant. However, the place they go to is in Shimo Kitazawa which would be a 90-minute walk. "
Samurai Gourmet,"Will do, thanks! "
Samurai Gourmet,"Midnight Diner is great, i randomly decided to watch it and now i want to watch more."
Samurai Gourmet,Imma second Phil. The guy from this show reminds me of him with the facial expressions and genuine joy lol
Samurai Gourmet,"I'm wondering if Netflix will license the original two seasons as they introduce the regular characters that show up at the diner like the gangster, the stripper and the chazuke sisters who just show up in this series without context. "
Samurai Gourmet,"Ugh, what a miserable life that must be..."
Samurai Gourmet,Holy fuck. This is the same guy from Shall We Dance??? Mind = blown
Samurai Gourmet,is it supposed to be his wife or his daughter?
Samurai Gourmet,That's cool and weird. 
Samurai Gourmet,"The lack of physical intimacy is common for a television show made in Japan. Japan does not have the same acceptance of PDA that the west does. I lived in Tokyo for a time and even my younger couple friends rarely displayed affection towards each other, and these were people who spent a lot of time with western students. 
It's most likely that the writer had the wife heading to yoga retreats to give the protagonist more time alone. Also, not uncommon for retired couples to start pursuing their own hobbies in Japan. "
Samurai Gourmet,Yes! Finally someone agrees with me!  There is something really wrong with their relationship!!!
Samurai Gourmet,"Thank you, that was illuminating. "
Samurai Gourmet,"When they portrayed the Chinese restaurant as completely empty and disgusting. Since the name of the restaurant was something like ""Madame Taipei"", both Chinese and Taiwanese people got super pissed. "
Samurai Gourmet,Very interesting--thank you!
Samurai Gourmet,It really is great (and I'm glad to find a fellow fan!) there are 4 seasons and a movie and a Korean remake that isn't that great but I'm always a little surprised by the caliber of actors on the show and how many neat people they get for cameos.
Samurai Gourmet,Where can you watch the first two seasons?
Samurai Gourmet,[deleted]
Samurai Gourmet,"> That's cool and weird. 

japan"
Samurai Gourmet,"But it's not PDA. When they're within their own home there is zero loving moments between them. It's just odd.

And it's not odd in the west for retired couples to start pursuing their own hobbies."
Samurai Gourmet,"The other explanation I could think of is that perhaps Kasumi, being the stereotypical Japanese corporate employee, must have worked crazy hours before his retirement, so his wife has gotten used to entertaining herself when he was at work? Since the series started right after his retirement, maybe she hasn't adapted to their new lifestyle yet? But damn, I can't imagine myself being so cool if my husband called and said he wasn't coming home for the night! She was like, cool, no question asked. I want me a wife like that too"
Samurai Gourmet,I thought they were father and daughter
Samurai Gourmet,Just watched episode 10 with the foreigners (westerners) in the skewer shop. The chef was very racist and rude towards them. But at least they pointed out the rude chef haha.
Samurai Gourmet,"Ah, makes sense!"
Samurai Gourmet,"Ummm..  the ummmm, errr, usual *cough* places where these kind of things show up, ya know...  Psst.. ""Kissasian"". 

Or your local Japanese food store that rents Japanese bootleg DVDs on the side. "
Samurai Gourmet,I have to disagree because of the high suicide rates and low birth rates Japan has.  Shaming people is never healthy in my opinion.
Samurai Gourmet,I mean PDA in the sense of public displays of affection on national television. 
Samurai Gourmet,"I'm a wife like that. But I think it starts with the husband and how trustworthy/sensible he is. I wouldn't ever expect my husband to do something stipid, which is why I'd be okay with it, haha."
Samurai Gourmet,R u a guy or  chick? 
Samurai Gourmet,"You need to go to Japan for a while to understand the good and bad of that kind of culture. It's isn't really shaming as much as feeling you are not contributing in a society that asks ""what can we do to help each other?"" vs the western self-centered ""What's in it for me?"". 
"
Samurai Gourmet,Ahh. But wouldn't the TV directors make the couple seem like a normal Japanese couple? Surely Japanese couples have cute moments when they're alone.
Samurai Gourmet,Yup it's just a different value system that can yield both good and bad outcomes. Can't judge it solely based on the facts you cited. 
Samurai Gourmet,"They do, but that's the difference - they usually only have those moments in private. It's considered a faux pas to do it in public, and it would probably make people uncomfortable/confused to have a heartwarming & feel-good TV show have a lot of overt PDA. This is a country that puts community over individual, so it's unsurprising that the show's creators didn't want to ruffle feathers by suddenly inserting such displays.

This isn't to say there is no media with PDA; there is, but it's usually within a specific kind of context or theme, such as a very dramatic romance (although even then you often don't see the level that is present in western films) or a gritty independent film. 

I should also mention that there ARE moments that Japanese people would consider signs of affection between the husband and wife, mostly in the way they speak to each other. They're very subtle though, so to us they seem like they're not affectionate. "
Samurai Gourmet,"Well, shows don't necessarily aspire to be naturalistic - in fact no TV show ever is, though western ones like to look the part as much as possible. Realistically, if a couple has sex at home will they be necessarily as self-conscious as to do it under bed covers or in ways that conveniently hide their genitals? Obviously not, but that's how it is portrayed in TV because otherwise you get porn and we can't have that. This is similar, but pushed a notch above."
Samurai Gourmet,I can see this! I'm a westerner but I think the relationship between them is very sweet. They are patience and understanding and comfortable with each other.
Samurai Gourmet,"Interesting. I don't really see how the community aspect applies to a husband and wife on TV, as it just seems like they're not very loving people. Sometimes it's okay to ruffle feathers if it's a good thing IMO.

However, thanks for understanding and explaining it to me!"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"She's so fucking good in Fringe. Liv can seem quite wooden at first, especially when she's opposite a man who regularly has emotional outbursts over sweets... until you start picking up on the fact she's just guarded in her expressions, and there's a million tiny ways she shows huge emotions"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Also, John Noble in Fringe should have gotten emmy noms or awards, he is seriously fantastic.  Awards ignoring a great performance just because its a sci-fi show"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"also 'the newsreader' for something more recent. basically follows her as a nightly news anchor in 1986 that covers a really interesting few months where we have halley's comet, the challenger disaster, important update on ""the dingo stole my baby"" case, bombing of a police station in australia, and chernobyl."
Crime Files: The Homefront,or Mindhunter. She's great in it and the show itself is so enjoyable and well crafted.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Brilliant series, one of John Noble's best roles. fun fact, there is an observer in every episode of Fringe, sometimes milling about in the background or,.. well.. observing."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I’m rewatching s1 right now! Been meaning to do a full rewatch of the series, so what better time to start"
Crime Files: The Homefront,My cat is named Olivia Dunham
Crime Files: The Homefront,[removed]
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe was SOOOOOO good.
Crime Files: The Homefront,Loved her in Mindhunters
Crime Files: The Homefront,I'd say her best performance is from The Newsreader. The rent was due.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Also, Mindhunter on Netflix."
Crime Files: The Homefront,I like the fringe so much I bought the whole DVD set
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Funny enough, I started S1 today"
Crime Files: The Homefront,Literally watching it right now. S1E6
Crime Files: The Homefront,She was amazing in Fringe.  Need more of her.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe is great. The last season is blatantly tacked on and imho, not very good."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Loved that series, but it got a little TOO weird towards the end."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I could never get through like season 4. Does it get better? Season 1 was one of the best seasons of television ever made, I just felt like they never knew where they were going after that."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I still can't believe that people tuned out. Such a great show but the decline in ratings influenced story changes, a move to Fridays which was considered a death sentence to any tv show, time jumps that later became a plot point. To be fair, that was a pretty genius move by the writers. The fact everyone wrote the show off at s3 but it held on for 2 more seasons is further proof of what a great show it was. It was originally intended to last longer than it did. For the time it did some pretty out of place things. For those who have yet to see it, it has multiple dimensions, multiple timelines, alternate realities, a giant conspiracy that spans the whole of 5 seasons, and multiple endings."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Whaaaat? I was a die-hard X-Files fan and you’re setting the expectations pretty high. I’ll give you that it ended poorly — both times, during the regular series and the reboot. 

But season 1-6 of The X-Files was insanely good. And Gillian Anderson was phenomenal from start to finish."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Xfiles did it first and did it better. X-files did go on too long and ended poorly, that's for sure."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe was amazing. Walter!
Crime Files: The Homefront,Great in Mindhunter aswell
Crime Files: The Homefront,I absolutely loved Fringe -- even bought the boxset during Amazon's prime day sales. Anna Torv was amazing. I loved her and Kirk Acevedo being partners. And when she had to play her alternate self. I miss the show immensely.
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is fantastic.100% recommended.
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is my all time favorite show. It was nice seeing Torv in LoU.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"X files on acid in the 70s
Who cares about the science, we've got new vfx to play with!"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"The whole cast in fringe is amazing, John Noble steals every scene he is in. It's also a LOT better than X-Files"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Please refresh, y memory. Didn't fringe have kind of a disappointing last few episodes?"
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is flawless. The only reason I’m considering watching the Last of Us is Anna Torv.
Crime Files: The Homefront,The first half of season 4 is some of the best TV I've seen.
Crime Files: The Homefront,She’s better in Mindhunter
Crime Files: The Homefront,"i had never seen her before, and she was instantly the most believable actor on Last of Us"
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is amazing after the first season which was a bad x files clone. Credit to the writers for realizing it and trying something new and much better.
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fuck. I thought it was Carrie Coon!!
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Loved Fringe, but it is nowhere near as good as X-Files."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I liked fringe, but the science was too awful to rate the show."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"*SLIGHTLY* higher?

SLIGHTLY?!

You take that word back!  Take it back now!

I jest with that, but seriously X-Files has nothing to compare to John Noble as Walter Bishop.  Not by a long shot."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I was thrilled to see she was in this new show, but very disappointed  with how that all turned out"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"One of the best shows ever, imo."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe was really good.

I rewatched it all a few years ago and it still holds up."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Oh Fringe! I almost forgot about that show. Not sure how - I absolutely loved it. No one talks about it.
Crime Files: The Homefront,Dang now I have to watch it if it’s better than the x files
Crime Files: The Homefront,Second!
Crime Files: The Homefront,I wish it was on Crave in Canada where we get most HBO shows.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I remember back in the day how many people was like ""flashforward if the new X-Files"" or ""the event is the new X-Files"" and both got cancelled after one season, in the meantime fringe was doing their own ""I'm the new X-Files"" in the corner.

I loved that show, I didn't like season two monster of the week episodes that much, but season three was awesome."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe was great
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I thought Fringe was great in the early seasons but gradually became worse as it progressed and the world got larger.   

Torv is a great actor though and did amazing playing two different characters in the show."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Really? Interesting. I thought Fringe was x-files but with modern garbage TV tropes and boring characters but to each their own I guess. You watched Warehouse 13 OP? I think you might like it, it's like Fringe but a different vehicle to tell the stories"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I was so excited for Fringe until I saw the male actor, yes the one also from Dawson's creek (never watched) I don't know if I'm the only person that this happens to but I feel a totally unjustified hatred towards the guy, can't stand his face, ruined Fringe for me"
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe definitely stuck the landing compared to a lot of shows.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe is the GOAT, though they kinda cheated us on the ending"
Crime Files: The Homefront,I watched the first couple of episodes and thought it was atrocious compared the The X-Files
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I saw the first  season and for me it lacks something. Its not dark or mystical enough and a bit too much cabel tv-tv. Does the tone change? What I love about xfiles season 1-5 is that you can really feel the surroundings. The rain, the forest, the fog. Fringe is more like xfiles 5-9. Very much studio feeling."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I keep seeing Fringe recommended, and I love X-Files, but I did not enjoy Fringe.  It seemed too predictable and formulaic.  However, I did not watch further than a few episodes into season 2 before dropping it.  I don't know if my opinion would improve later in the series."
Crime Files: The Homefront, This discussion really making me want to Fringe 😩😩
Crime Files: The Homefront,"The X-Files will always be iconic, and many of its episodes are some of the greatest in the history of television. Its experiments with the idea of a serialized mythology offered pretty mixed results at times, but the few shows were ever in their element as The X-Files doing some of those classic monster of the week episodes. Shows that followed, especially during that 2004-2010 period, like Lost and Battlestar Galactica, owed much to the X-Files. 

And none more so than Fringe, obviously. 

I think Fringe is a perfect example of taking a familiar concept or premise, and not being too preoccupied with “filing the serial numbers off,” so to speak. It’s totally just The X-Files, BUT the difference is that Fringe has a clear idea about the kind of mythology it wants to explore from the outset; the writers found a genuinely clever way to use the monster of the week format to build towards a larger goal, and Fringe’s mythology is truly one of the best in tv. 

But probably the *biggest* reason Fringe stands above X-Files, is *John motherfucking Noble*. Genuinely, Walter Bishop is the secret sauce of Fringe and one of the most charming and beautifully realized characters in all television. It’s actually pretty remarkable how many great characters came right out the gate after 2004; we talk about the “golden age of television” now (and have for years at this point) but a lot of these network television series walked so these prestige tv programs could run. They had messier endings, but still left a huge mark."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is not good.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe is just the Bluebloods version of X-Files, and it's also trash. Seriously weak acting performances from both Torv and Jackson. Skip Intro's episode on spooky cop shows is the best deep dive into why X-Files is the superior content, when comparing the two shows."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Don't fall for it. She was terrible in ""Fringe"".

The series itself is a terrible pseudoscience/police procedural with its only redeeming quality being a parallel universe long arc that was explored much, much better in ""Counterpart""."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe was better than the majority of X-Files which fell off pretty hard after the first couple seasons.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Hard agree on the better than X files .
I think some individual episodes of x files are some of the best sci Fi tv ever ,but as an over all series Fringe has the better story , character development,and consistency"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe was so much better than XFiles, all the interpersonal relationships flowed so much more naturally than the ""made for fandom"" sexual tension between Mulder and Scully.

Plus Fringe kept on track with it's original premise, unlike Xfiles that started off as a really cool show about unsolved cases of strange phenomena  only to get stuck on ""They're Out There"" alien-hybrid conspiracies.

I think Fringe didnt get the attention it deserved because viewers were burned out and bored of XFiles and assumed Fringe was going to be just another copy-cat show."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Only thing better than Fringe was Eureka!
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is leagues above TXF. It had a consistent overall mythology and story arc that ended on it's own terms in an amazing way.
Crime Files: The Homefront,Spoiler….. she dies in episode two 🤦‍♂️
Crime Files: The Homefront,She's also great in an Australian TV series called The Newsreader
Crime Files: The Homefront,"ya, Fringe was really effing good. if you like sci fi schlock and havent seen it, get on it. its one of the greats."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Literally what I started on Monday lol
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Welp, it's been a few years.  Time for another Fringe rewatch."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Mmmmm Anna Torv as a redhead.
Crime Files: The Homefront,HBOMAX Europe as well! Just started another rewatch.
Crime Files: The Homefront,I completely didn’t realize it was her until someone pointed it out to me
Crime Files: The Homefront,Didn’t even realise that was the actress from Fringe
Crime Files: The Homefront,This statement compares to: true
Crime Files: The Homefront,I've only watched the first episode but I really enjoyed her performance and I can't wait to see where the rest of the season takes her character
Crime Files: The Homefront,I watched an episode of Fringe before watching TLOU and it took me a bit to realize why Tess looked so familiar. Funny how that happens sometimes.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe had it's moments but some of the seasons were weak, if you power through it - the last season was great imo."
Crime Files: The Homefront,She also had a great part in Mindhunter (great show).
Crime Files: The Homefront,I've watched first season but didn't enjoy it much does it get better?
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I got halfway through the first season. I want to get into it and finish it , but I had trouble getting through the monster of the week episodes."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Haven't watched the last of us show yet (loved the game), but I actually recently started watching Fringe funnily enough. I'm about halfway through the first season, and I'm enjoying it. Glad to see Anna torv getting more exposure."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I just finished watching her in the Australian show ""Secret City"" and I loved her performance in it. I found it on Netflix and there are two seasons."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe was fucking amazing and she was definitely great in it. I'm glad to see that she's getting some recognition.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I couldn't figure out who she was I. This show, I thought she was Donna from the 70s show.

The crazy thing is I loved fringe up until the last season when they had to wrap it up. At least there was closer to the show and it didn't just end."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Well this is awkward...
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe was amazing
Crime Files: The Homefront,"It makes me feel old that Fringe is a TIL subject since that’s where I know her from the most since she’s the protagonist, She’s also on that Netflix show where they interview serial killers."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Thank you.  I was trying to figure out where I remembered her from.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"That ending still gives me goosebumps.

>!🌷!<"
Crime Files: The Homefront,I stopped watching Fringe on the last episode of the last season. I think Joshua Jackson as Peter was the past holding bastion of good things about a show that had so badly Flanderised itself that I just didn't care about the outcome. Felt like the show found all of the fan favourite traits and wrote the show to be only those traits.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"As a fan since the original airings, I love how this show is having a small resurgence of popularity due to Anna Torv in The Last of Us."
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Fringe was great, and if you're like me  and care about this sort of thing, it has an ending, no cancelled forever cliffhanger 😁"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"always wanted to check it out, it's available on NowTV, I just have to find the time"
Crime Files: The Homefront,"I loved fringe and we just rewatched it. But I can’t watch Last Of Us.  Maybe I’m missing something ,but this whole zombie apocalypse thing is just not what I need right now to take my mind off the hell that is our actual reality."
Crime Files: The Homefront,Fringe is amazing!  Anna Torv is also in Mindhunter.
Crime Files: The Homefront,"Holy shit, I knew she reminded me of someone. I just had the same thing happen watching The Sopranos and Bokeem Woodbine was on an episode. Looked him up to confirm I saw him in the Halo TV series not long ago."
Crime Files: The Homefront,She’s pretty good in ‘The Newsreader’ TV Series. The show overall is a Meh.
Crime Files: The Homefront,I really don't know what happened in Season 5 where they writing literally went haywired. It really reminds me of crappy writing of Westworld season 4.
Cheer Squad,That's low for Six Feet Under
Cheer Squad,"I'd put All In The Family higher. It was truly groundbreaking, being the first show to frequently discuss racism, sexism, homophobia, war, etc."
Cheer Squad,"Sepinwall is an odd read.  I think many of his commentaries and insights are great reads, some barely rise above fan service, and other times he seems to have missed the point entirely of a narrative.  

It makes for schizophrenic reading.  Like, on the movie side, I always enjoyed reading Roger Ebert.  Even if you didn't agree with his opinion, you could see that his issue came from a valid place.

But on several occasions, it feels like he sees only what's right in front of his nose.  It's bizarre."
Cheer Squad,Mad Men is better than Breaking Bad. There I said it
Cheer Squad,I feel IASIP should be instead of HIMYM. Or just on list. Most original comedy series last 10 years.
Cheer Squad,It's spelled Frasier.
Cheer Squad,"They have DS9 and original Star Trek, but not next generation?  "
Cheer Squad,Terriers with one season! nicee
Cheer Squad,"Was going to shit on the list and list out my own opinions, then realized this is their opinions...so, c'est la vie.

Plus, they have some of my criminally underrated favorites (Homicide and EZ Streets)"
Cheer Squad,"For me they nailed the top 4.  It'd be the top top six if Mad Men and Breaking Bad swapped places.

But that just my own opinion."
Cheer Squad,10 complete and 11 in progress... I've got some work to do.
Cheer Squad,"Really glad to see In Treatment on this list. It does a very specific, very niche thing -- but it does it so phenomenally. Easily in my top 10."
Cheer Squad,"Very solid list. Of course I'd take maybe 40 of those off and replace them with different shows, but I'm sure everyone could say that.

- Love seeing The Shield so high. That was one of the best dramas on TV. I'd go top-10, maybe top-5. If you've never seen it, you should seriously get a Hulu subscription just to watch it.
- The Joss Whedon shows, ugh. I know a lot of people like them, I know they're kind of lighthearted fun, but I've always found them difficult to really get into. You scratch the surface and there's not much there.
- Too light on '60s classics. The Fugitive, The Prisoner, Route 66, I could name a dozen more, very high quality television on par with the prestige dramas of today.
- Oh wait. I guess The Prisoner didn't make it because it's British. Phew. Because that's a top-20 show.
- The incredibly inventive 30 Rock behind Moonlighting and The Cosby Show and other broad, ""simple and sweet"" sitcoms kind of stings.
- I'm used to It's Always Sunny getting completely snubbed everywhere, so this is no great surprise.
- Besides the Whedon shows, My So Called Life? Gilmore Girls? These are top-100 shows? I know certain pockets of the internet demand you take teenage drama and angst seriously lest you be called old and out of touch, but these are good shows *for teens*. I find it pretty hard to make a case they belong on a list with great shows for adults like The West Wing and Twin Peaks and The Wire and so on. But we do fetishize teenagers in our culture, that's for sure. I'm not saying they're bad shows, but putting them on a best of all-time list seems like trying too hard to give these schlocky soaps relevance because they're about teenagers, when half-good, half-cheezy soaps about adults like Dallas and Dynasty were left off.
- Needed Alfred Hitchcock Presents, the anthology show as good as The Twilight Zone, which is one of the best shows of all time (which is to say, Alfred Hitchcock Presents was a phenomenal show).
- I love the animation choices. Simpsons, Spongebob, King of the Hill, South Park, Batman Animated, Futurama, Rocky & Bullwinkle, television classics. I'd have put Adventure Time in there too. While its quality has certainly wavered over 200+ episodes, it's really one of the most unique shows ever on TV, and also one of the most philosophically sophisticated."
Cheer Squad,"HIMYM doesn't get enough credit for how clever it was, these days. Yes I know the ending sucked."
Cheer Squad,No Sanford and Son is surprising.  At its peak it was only second to All in the family for ratings. 
Cheer Squad,Where is Stargate SG1??!?
Cheer Squad,I didn't realise Cheers was *that* good. Worth watching these days? I am a massive Friends and HIMYM fan.
Cheer Squad,Twin Peaks Should be on Top 3.
Cheer Squad,"Initial thoughts:

The Shield is ranked waaay too high (an unpopular opinion, I know). Justified needs to be higher. I'm astonished that Batman made the list twice, especially the Adam West version. If Deadwood can break into the top ten with one really great season, one Hall of Fame level season, and one mostly really good season with glaring weak points then Hannibal needs to be ranked higher. "
Cheer Squad,Surprised that Game of Thrones isn't on the list at all
Cheer Squad,"Trying not to look at the list too much because I'm really looking forward to reading it. Marked it with a spoiler tag just in case anyone feels the same way, but thanks for posting!"
Cheer Squad,"Maybe it's just me, but I feel Futurama should be way, way higher on that list. "
Cheer Squad,"This is the first time I've ever seen Picket Fences mentioned on this sub. I used to watch that with my family as a kid, it was a good show."
Cheer Squad,"Glad to see some love for Golden Girls. Didn't appreciate a lot of the humor when my mom and sisters had reruns on 24/7 as a 5 year old. Its honestly my guilty pleasure that isn't too guilty, especially since about three quarters of the people I know, guys included, enjoy the show in some capacity."
Cheer Squad,"Batman: The Animated Series should be higher. Believe it or not, around the time the show started Batman's popularity was fading. The show not only helped popularize the character again, it added new, critical parts to his mythology  (invented Harley Quinn, gave Mr. Freeze a tragic origin story) and created a version of Batman that distilled everything great about different versions of the character into something iconic. It had one of the most brilliant opening sequences of any TV show (it visually tells you everything important about the character's backstory) and if you track the character's arc, you see him becoming darker and more broken as the stress of being Batman takes its toll, and that character development carries over into Justice League and JLU. And this was a kids show supposedly. "
Cheer Squad,"Thanks, I plan to buy the book but wanted to know the rundown because I read both of them regularly. The essays are the real meat."
Cheer Squad,"lol parks and rec is higher than the office. scoff
"
Cheer Squad,Yeah- I've only watched about a third of the shows on the list but SFU is in my top 3 dramas 
Cheer Squad,[deleted]
Cheer Squad,"Man, this is so on point.

I discovered him when I went searching for reviews of The Wire, and when he's inspired he's simply the best.  

Then he'll write positive reviews of shows that are in serious decline or just bad, and I'm half convinced he's doing it to maintain good relationships with the showrunners (who he'll interview after the season).  Or worse, he's just looking for clicks and keeps reviewing popular shows.

Finally, there are times where I'm not even sure if he actually watched the show.  HBO's ""The Night Of"" is an example of that.  He praised the heck out of it right off the bat.  He said he had seen the first 6ish episodes and they were all great.  Then, I noticed that his weekly recaps leaned more towards ""and then here's what happened next"" plot summaries.  For his last review, he brought up complaints about the show that were very prevelant thoughout the whole season (after the pilot).  I couldn't understand it....if he had those complaints (which I did too), how come they were never mentioned beforehand?  So even within the context of a single opinion of a show/season, he had a schizophrenic take.

He's my favorite reviewer, but there's something just ""off"" sometimes (and yes, I know it's possible it's just me projecting when his tastes differ than mine).

He also missed a HUGE point of the ending of the Westworld pilot, which seems almost impossible."
Cheer Squad,"Definitely fair criticism (and I totally agree about Ebert, he explained his reasoning very well). The book is very well written, though, and has fewer of the ""miss the point"" reviews, mostly because they're both discussing shows that they like."
Cheer Squad,*gasp*
Cheer Squad,"It made the sort of ""honorable honorable mentions"" list where it was described as a show that has ""run forever without losing its rough edges or ability to inspire howling laughter.""

Neither show captured me enough to stick with them, but then I'm not a huge sitcom fan."
Cheer Squad,Fraijer
Cheer Squad,Dammit!
Cheer Squad,It was in their honorable mentions. 
Cheer Squad,Sepinwall *loves* Terriers. He doesn't shut up about that show.
Cheer Squad,"The top five all tied in score, so the first chapter is discussing all five in depth, and it's actually pretty terrific, except for the part where MZS says he prefers The Jazz Singer to The Godfather.

I still need to finish Mad Men."
Cheer Squad,So glad I have HBO Now so I can catch up on some of these shows.
Cheer Squad,"I really quite like In Treatment.  Perhaps I'm not in touch, but it seemed like one of those shows that people didn't really talk that much about.  "
Cheer Squad,"I really liked The Shield but I'm okay with where it ranks. It sagged a bit in the middle for me to rank up in the Wire/Breaking Bad zone.

I know some adults who will go to bat for Gilmore Girls. I never watched it myself.

Yes to Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

They listed Adventure Time among their favorite ""still running"" shows, so I guess it hasn't qualified yet. I'm still making my way through it.

Although it technically doesn't qualify, I would have made room for Looney Tunes/Merry Melodies cartoons. Yes, they were originally theatrical shorts, blah blah blah. So what. 99% of the people around today became acquainted with them through TV, and they've influenced almost every cartoon (and a great many live-action shows) since. The authors never even acknowledged them. I would have been tempted to include Animaniacs among the Top 100, or at the very minimum, an honorable mention. Kid humor with enough sophistication for adults."
Cheer Squad,"Have you watched all of Gilmore Girls? I'm extremely biased, but I think it's one of those shows that gets is completely different from what it seems at the surface. It's a family dramedy that masquerades as a teen show, not the other way around. "
Cheer Squad,"> My So Called Life? Gilmore Girls? 

These have always been ranked in top 100 lists"
Cheer Squad,"The biggest frustration is that is was really only like 4 minutes of the ending that ""ruined"" it. The introduction of the Mother was fantastic and she really was the perfect mother..."
Cheer Squad,"Yeah, they mention that in the review, that despite the ending sucking they enjoyed the rest of it enough. I didn't make it past the first season. Not my cuppa."
Cheer Squad,"The list isn't about ratings. Otherwise shows like Home Improvement would be in there. The list leans more towards original, less conventional shows. I don't think Sanford and Son was particularly noteworthy in that regard, but YMMV.

"
Cheer Squad,"In perpetual reruns on SyFy, probably."
Cheer Squad,"The problem with older shows like that is that you've probably seen a lot of TV shows that were influenced by Cheers in one way or another. So now if you go back and watch the original it may seem a little cliche and derivative. But at the time it was fresh and groundbreaking.

It's still funny now, but I don't think you could get the full experience."
Cheer Squad,"Did you watch Frasier at all? If you liked Frasier, you'll probably like Cheers, which was a little sharper, funnier, a little more acidic than it's spinoff. It's not as sentimental as Friends or HIMYM, and the characters are older, so it's not about them trying to find romance with one another either (except for Sam & Diane in Seasons 1-5), but it remained solidly funny for 12 years without any real dips in quality, which is amazing in retrospect."
Cheer Squad,Love Twin Peaks.
Cheer Squad,I had no idea Hannibal was so highly considered. I'll have to check it out.
Cheer Squad,"I believe the criteria is that the show needs to have ended its run.

The Simpsons is number 1, but no one has watched that show for decades :)"
Cheer Squad,>No currently ongoing shows unless they had been around for a long time (like The Simpsons or South Park).
Cheer Squad,"Sepinwall talked about it and where he would place it on this list.

http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/ask-alan-game-of-thrones-all-time-ranking-live-tv-and-shows-whose-titles-dont-make-sense"
Cheer Squad,He said the the top 100 list is for shows that have ended their run.
Cheer Squad,My apologies!
Cheer Squad,It would be in my top 10. 
Cheer Squad,"Terrific show, especially early on. "
Cheer Squad,"Golden Girls was terrific, and I was really happy to see it's inclusion. I remember there was an interview with Seth Meyers where he said he wanted to do some sort of Golden Girls skit on SNL, but after doing his research, they couldn't come up with anything that the show hadn't already done first."
Cheer Squad,Not really Batman 89 came out a few years prior and was popular as was returns
Cheer Squad,¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Cheer Squad,I like Six Feet Under but the last couple of seasons are pretty terrible.﻿
Cheer Squad,Thanks for the tip!  That was my only concern.  Definitely gonna check it out.
Cheer Squad,"What shows are on the ""honorable mentions"" list? "
Cheer Squad,"No. It's ""Frajer."" And I should know. I'm Frajer."
Cheer Squad,I should throw some tossed salad at scrambled eggs at you. 
Cheer Squad,30 Rock is a Top 10 show.
Cheer Squad,"Im happy they at least mentioned it.  I get having TOS, because it started it all.  I just think next generation is a superior show."
Cheer Squad,It was All That Jazz that MZS put over The Godfather(agreed that it was weird though).
Cheer Squad,"> Although it technically doesn't qualify, I would have made room for Looney Tunes/Merry Melodies cartoons. Yes, they were originally theatrical shorts, blah blah blah. So what. 99% of the people around today became acquainted with them through TV, and they've influenced almost every cartoon (and a great many live-action shows) since. The authors never even acknowledged them.

I agree with all these points. Looney Tunes and Disney shorts, in my opinion, are some of the greatest art America has produced in any medium. But they are theatrical shorts outside of the sub-par 1960s Looney Tunes, so I guess that's that if you want to be strict."
Cheer Squad,"> Have you watched all of Gilmore Girls? I'm extremely biased, but I think it's one of those shows that gets is completely different from what it seems at the surface. It's a family dramedy that masquerades as a teen show, not the other way around.

I haven't watched all of Gilmore Girls, or even half of it, so admittedly I'm not in a position to be a good judge of the show. And people I know with good taste seem to defend it, so I'll concede there must be more to it than I've seen in a handful of episodes."
Cheer Squad,Most of the finale sucked though. Divorcing Barney and Robin fifteen minutes in after spending an entire season preparing for their wedding is an example. Continuity errors regarding when Ted got married. Not just the ending itself.
Cheer Squad,"Do yourself a favor and head back one more time to watch ""Slap Bet"" in season 2. Definitely their best episode. And if you don't enjoy it? Eh, it's only 21 more minutes"
Cheer Squad,"I've never actually watched Frasier, might give Cheers a shot though. Thanks"
Cheer Squad,Damn Fine!!
Cheer Squad,"It's definitely not for everyone, but if a show that's an art house nightmare with corpses that straddle the line between beautiful and horrific is your kind of thing definitely check it out."
Cheer Squad,do you have some sort of TL;DW?
Cheer Squad,No need to apologize ;)
Cheer Squad,"I probably would too, but how many in the top ten on this list have you seen. It's kind of hard to compare a show you haven't seen to something you have seen. Remember this is a best all-time list, not best of the last 20 years."
Cheer Squad,"What I call the honorable mentions were listed in a chapter called A Certain Regard, which was basically a list of stuff one or both of them liked that didn't make the Top 100.

Cheer Squad,"Whoops, that was it, thank you."
Cheer Squad,"Yeah, I think it takes the first two seasons to see it. I can understand how it would seem like a teen drama, but it's actually much more interested in Lorelai than Rory, and the teen drama stuff was for the WB. "
Cheer Squad,"That part is a fair criticism, but obviously necessary to facilitate the ending revelation. It did have the side effect of giving Barney a nice ending with his new daughter. But I think the finale is worth it just for THAT scene, where they finally meet at the train station."
Cheer Squad,Definitely check out Frasier at some point. It's typically heralded as one of the best sitcoms in TV history and IMO surpasses Cheers.
Cheer Squad,Sounds like a party!
Cheer Squad,"He said probably in the Top 100, but not necessarily very high. He considers it ""a show of great moments"" but not a great overall show, however he may change his mind if the last two seasons are phenomenal."
Cheer Squad,He would personally place it towards the end of his top 100. He thinks it's not so much a great show as a show with great moments. In between those moments he thinks it dips a lot. He might change his mind based on how it ends.
Cheer Squad,"It's reasonable that a lot of people have seen 8 of the top 10. Maybe not each episode, but a good chunk of them. 

That being said, whenever you grade shows for a list like this with categories like influence, it favors older shows. That's not always a bad thing, especially when you state that it's part of the ratings for the list, but I still say Futurama is a bit too low. "
Cheer Squad,"Like I said in my other comment, Don't really agree because lot's of shows feel that way but I can respect his opinion."
Cheer Squad,"Hmm, Well I don't agree with him I respect his opinion."
Cheer Squad,"Yeah, totally agreed. I think every show that has lasted more than three seasons has had it's low points. It's the high marks that set great shows apart."
Cheer Squad,"It's also a bit odd when he has 24 ranked 57th. I enjoyed 24, but it has plenty of glaring problems at times too, including the inconsistency that Sepinwall holds against GoT.

I'm happy to see Law & Order on the list, though - it obviously ran on well past its prime, but it was a really good show for a long time."
Eden of the East the Movie,"Seems strange to frame Cathy as the star of East of Eden, but it sounds promising!"
Eden of the East the Movie,"In what warped planet is Cathy an anti-hero?

The book outright describes her as so evil and so do her actions."
Eden of the East the Movie,"I’m super concerned by using the phrase “antihero” to describe Cathy. This is not the character to reframe in some sort of feminist reclamation. She’s a horrible, broken sociopath. Fascinating, compelling, all that stuff. But not an antihero. Florence would be great in the role but I’m scared of this now."
Eden of the East the Movie,I have a feeling we'll get more John Steinbeck adaptations as economic conditions worsen.  I bet a lot of properties from the 20s will be modernized
Eden of the East the Movie,"I truly hope this will be good, east of eden is one of the best novels ever written as far as i am concerned, doing that justice isn't easy.  
I'd rather see it at HBO, but hopefully netflix is trying to truly make prestige tv here."
Eden of the East the Movie,I can't think of a book I'm more protective of mentally than east of eden cause the characters are just so good and vivid. Can't help myself but be cautious but I'm remaining positive
Eden of the East the Movie,I will actually watch anything with Florence Pugh at this point. She’s got so many interesting projects coming up.
Eden of the East the Movie,"Zoe Kazan is writing and producing:

>The limited series adaptation of John Steinbeck’s epic novel will explore themes of trauma and repair; love and betrayal; duty and free will. The series will sketch an intimate portrait of the Trask family against the backdrop of huge historical forces — or, as Steinbeck put it, “the story of my country and the story of me.”

Kazan's grandfather Elia directed the original 1955 movie."
Eden of the East the Movie,East of Eden is one of my all-time favourites and Pugh is a fantastic actress but...Cathy Ames as an anti-hero? Really? She was out and out evil.
Eden of the East the Movie,I didn't know that Zoe Kazan wrote *Wildlife* - that movie's fantastic.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I've got the book collecting dust, I really should give it a read this summer."
Eden of the East the Movie,[deleted]
Eden of the East the Movie,Curious who will play Lee
Eden of the East the Movie,Florence Pugh is a part of so many projects I’m excited for.
Eden of the East the Movie,"If you'd asked me to guess which of these two women in the thumbnail is twelve years older than the other, I would have guessed wrong"
Eden of the East the Movie,Please film on location! Salinas valley
Eden of the East the Movie,Florence Pugh is one of those actors that I'll watch anything she's in so this is now on my radar.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I'm not the biggest fan of Pugh (she is a good actress), but when I saw this news my instant thought was she'd actually be a perfect fit for the character. She has had a few roles already where her character was cold/rude/kinda stuck up and entitled, yet you don't outright hate them. 

It's a wonderful novel and am looking forward to this adaptation. Nothing will ever be able to hold a candle to Steinbeck's words, but it will be interesting to see how she presents the story."
Eden of the East the Movie,"Florence Pugh once drank six cuppas in an hour or so, my ideal girl"
Eden of the East the Movie,Is this finally happening?
Eden of the East the Movie,[removed]
Eden of the East the Movie,damn! east of eden has already been filmed before. Do west of eden instead.
Eden of the East the Movie,She’s a good actress but I wonder if she got her big break because she’s dating someone 20 years older than her who’s directed and produced movies (Zach Braff).
Eden of the East the Movie,Well that sounds wonderful honestly
Eden of the East the Movie,"Damn, now I have to finish the book lol."
Eden of the East the Movie,"Everyone has that friend or family member of the group that's supposed to bring drinks for a potluck and then don't show up, so you're left just eating glizzies dry. Eventually, you learn not to count on them and just let yourself be pleasantly surprised when they actually show up for a change. 

That's Netflix now."
Eden of the East the Movie,"I think Pugh's an excellent casting choice for Cathy- honestly if you gave me an hour and a list of A listers and asked me to cast her, she'd probably be my pick in terms of her overall ability and affect (though probably she should be physically more waifish- but that's not as big an issue). 

That said, I agree with others who are stumped by the description of Cathy as an antihero. I'm hoping this doesn't turn into her getting some kind of deep emotional moment that's not in the book and that ruins her character."
Eden of the East the Movie,"I love Florence Pugh as an actor but she's almost too ""likeable"" to play someone like Cathy (who's just pure evil and an absolute psychopath). 

Someone like Julia Garner or Jennifer Lawrence would've been great as her instead, as they both can really turn on that ""coldness"" and dettachment that are vital parts of Cathy's character imo."
Eden of the East the Movie,Oh! That’s my favorite Steinbeck book! I’m excited.
Eden of the East the Movie,Wow
Eden of the East the Movie,My guess is because Cathy is such a showy character. A few years ago they were going to adapt it with Jennifer Lawrence as Cathy. I just hope they stick to Cathy being evil and don't soften her up too much just because they have a big name attached to play her. Her being a monster is key.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I agree. East of Eden is one of my favorites, and it seems really strange to frame Cathy as an anti-hero unless they were to make serious changes to the story. Which isn’t a bad thing if done well but rarely is"
Eden of the East the Movie,"Well she is a very intriguing character and part of the very core of it.  
I hope this will be good, one of the best novels i've read."
Eden of the East the Movie,"Yeah that was a strange choice of words on Zoe Kazan's part. Antiheroes usually have some sort of redeeming qualities, and Cathy Ames from the book didn't really have any, to my recollection. Cathy was straight-up evil."
Eden of the East the Movie,Yeah what the hell is she on about. Makes me nervous for this adaptation just from that sentence alone.
Eden of the East the Movie,"That one word in the article really soured me on this. Book adaptations usually live or die based on how well the writer and director understand the source material.

For a great example, there's a video where Villeneuve describes his direction of the Gom Jabbar scene in *Dune*. He very clearly understands the scene at a high level, and every single filmmaking decision was informed by what made the scene work in the book.

If Zoe Kazan sees Cathy as any sort of antihero, she severely misinterpreted the book. Even if she first read it as a teenager, she should have known better back then.

Best case is that Kazan either confused on what an ""antihero"" is or she's being misleading because the word ""antihero"" will rope people in who are unfamiliar with the book."
Eden of the East the Movie,"There’s nothing heroic about her. In the book it’s pretty clear she’s evil, she talks about moving back east and making a man fall in love with her then deliberately driving him to suicide so she can inherit all his money."
Eden of the East the Movie,"to be honest, I rarely see the term ""anti-hero"" used correctly."
Eden of the East the Movie,Antihero is used to describe lots of shitty people who we nonetheless get to know intimately as main character. Hell people have used Patrick Bateman as an example of antihero.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I googled the definition of antihero and don't see the issue? All the definitions I could find were very similar, is there another definition?

antihero: a central character in a story, movie, or drama who lacks conventional heroic attributes"
Eden of the East the Movie,"You’re supposed to view her as evil from the male gaze of that time but really she escapes the men who dominate her life, and uses their own immorality against them with the brothel. She’s not a part of the Cain and Abel duality because she doesn’t follow a binary morality."
Eden of the East the Movie,Yikes sweaty. You need to reframe your internalized misogyny. Steinbeck was a cis white man and therefore is the true evil.
Eden of the East the Movie,we are getting napoleon and nosferatu movies soon as well
Eden of the East the Movie,I’ve always thought *The Grapes of Wrath* would be perfect material for a Martin Scorsese x Leonardo DiCaprio x Robert De Niro collab.
Eden of the East the Movie,Hell yea! I love his work. The old movies didn’t do it justice for me
Eden of the East the Movie,"I know people love to give Netflix shit on here, but their limited series are usually pretty good."
Eden of the East the Movie,"This is my thought. If you’re going to try to adapt a novel with such scope, so much depth and so many layers… You better invest an absolute fuckton in the writing and direction. That will be infinitely more important than whoever is acting in it. This casting tells me they probably have it backwards and makes me think it’s a cashgrab. I’d love to be wrong, though."
Eden of the East the Movie,Honestly I think it’ll be extremely difficult to adapt this in a way that’s satisfying to fans of the book. At least they are making it a series and not a movie
Eden of the East the Movie,"Same. And it has one of my favorite lines: “The chowder had blown both ways…”

Of all the beautiful phrases Steinbeck has strung together, the one that stuck most in my brain involved vomit and diarrhea."
Eden of the East the Movie,Lol see you at the Puss in Boots 2 screening 😂
Eden of the East the Movie,Same here. She has quickly become one of my favorite actors.
Eden of the East the Movie,"She was horribly miscast in ""The Little Dummer Girl"". But I liked her in a lot of other stuff."
Eden of the East the Movie,"> The series will sketch an intimate portrait of the Trask family

Shoud say Trask and Hamilton families. 

Samuel Hamilton (and Lee) is the beating heart of East of Eden."
Eden of the East the Movie,"
>Kazan's father Elia directed the original 1955 movie.

Wow that's a really interesting fact"
Eden of the East the Movie,"It's one of my favorite books of all time. I left it on my bookshelf for over a year because I had heard how good it was and was apprehensive of reading one of the best books ever written (never meet your heroes, right?).

I'm so glad I finally read it. It's not perfect, but it was incredible."
Eden of the East the Movie,Yes you should. It’s a great story in every way.
Eden of the East the Movie,There was a 1981 TV miniseries version with Jane Seymour as well.
Eden of the East the Movie,She also ate a *lot* of hot sauce on *Hawkeye*.
Eden of the East the Movie,She's a tea head is she?
Eden of the East the Movie,"If you click on the picture, it is a link which will take you to the original article."
Eden of the East the Movie,"She's been more relevent than Braff since before they started dating, if anything she kept his name in people's minds."
Eden of the East the Movie,[deleted]
Eden of the East the Movie,"Lady McBeth as Katherine was a murdering lunatic , Yelana Belova was the likeable psycho"
Eden of the East the Movie,"In 1981, Jane Seymour played Cathy in the tv mini-series. She was the star and Cathy was still very rotten. [East of Eden (1981)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083409/?ref_=vp_close)"
Eden of the East the Movie,"Agree! But someone like Jennifer Lawrence would be perfect I think. Insanely attractive, to the point you’d accept the crazy and end up with your house burnt down and almost be okay with it."
Eden of the East the Movie,She is baited as anti hero early in the book but never ends up being one. Maybe this is what they're going for.
Eden of the East the Movie,"because any female characters can't be complete putrid beings like book Cathy these days, they have to have a reason, which usually can be traced back to abusive white men; worst form of feminism imaginable"
Eden of the East the Movie,They made another Dune movie???
Eden of the East the Movie,"Right, but the definition implies that an antihero is *still* a hero, albeit one who lacks the conventional attributes. Cathy is not a hero in any sense - she’s just evil for evil’s sake."
Eden of the East the Movie,"Respectfully, I don’t agree that this was Steinbeck’s intention or an accurate modern interpretation of the character. Cathy, simply put, is evil. She enjoys evil for evil’s sake; she enjoys manipulating and hurting people, sometimes for profit but mostly because it’s enjoyable for her. 

She’s akin to a psychopath. She’s not evil because “hurt people hurt people”; she’s evil in the biblical sense. She’s representative of the bible’s snake-like Satan: “and when she swallowed, her little tongue flicked around her lips”."
Eden of the East the Movie,"You clearly have no idea what happened in the story. Cathy is totally amoral. She's not some angel of justice. She killed her own mother just because it was easier than leaving her alive.

The book is extremely explicit over and over again that Cathy is missing that essential part of humanity that allows one to feel empathy for another person. I genuinely don't know how you could have read the book (if you did) and reached your interpretation."
Eden of the East the Movie,Woah
Eden of the East the Movie,Didn't the Nosferatu movie get cancelled? The Robert Eggers one
Eden of the East the Movie,"It's not that i wanna shit on netflix, but in my eyes netflix isn't really known for its prestige tv per se, series which are the best one can watch. HBO is though.  
And for this novel, that is exactly what one needs in my eyes."
Eden of the East the Movie,"It needs Cary Fukunaga directing. His period work in Jane Eyre, Beasts of No Nation, and True Detective S1 is unparalleled, and he’d probably welcome the chance to work on a more intimate project before the Broccolis inevitably ask him to come back for the Bond reboot."
Eden of the East the Movie,"Yeah I’ll be there, it looks fun! I’m not sure if your being sarcastic or not, but if you aren’t, I hope you enjoy it too!"
Eden of the East the Movie,I saw the first movie having a bad trip on shrooms. It was ok
Eden of the East the Movie,She was incredible in LDG
Eden of the East the Movie,Why was she miscast? I thought she did well in a complex role.
Eden of the East the Movie,Did you watch the show before or after she blew up? I think she was great for the role. The casting director of that show also did Dune and The Lobster among other great shows and movies.
Eden of the East the Movie,"Samuel and Lee were two of the best characters I’ve ever read. Of course, the majority of the characters are very well put together but there’s something about Samuel and Lee that makes me feel at ease. Like everything’s going to be okay."
Eden of the East the Movie,Samuel is maybe my favorite character in all of literature.
Eden of the East the Movie,Wait til you hear about how he named names to the house for unAmerican activities and then directed on the waterfront to rub it in.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I mean, he was a very successful director and she has a spot in the door because of him"
Eden of the East the Movie,I've heard pretty good things though I'm going in blind. I've had it for almost a year it seems like but I'd love to get it read before the adaptation so I can visualize things myself without influence.
Eden of the East the Movie,"Yorkshire Tea gave her, her own box with Flo's Tea on it"
Eden of the East the Movie,I feel like Reddit has a crush on her the same way they did JLaw and will turn on her when she makes a wrong move. People like Harvey Weinstein all but confirmed the existence of the casting couch trope. It’s not a stretch of the imagination to say that her partner helped her along the way.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I remember watching that as a little kid with my parents.  Probably, not the best thing for a child to watch.

Oh Jane.."
Eden of the East the Movie,I recently read it and pictured Cathy as Emma Stone.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I just read the book for the first time a couple of months ago, and I completely disagree that she was ever set up as an anti-hero. She was clearly psychotic and selfish from the outset with no redeeming qualities. Book spoilers: >!One of her first actions in the book is to ruin the lives of two young boys, then she drove a teacher to suicide and then committed premediated murder of her parents just because her dad beat her once after she ran away.!<

There is some discussion in the book about how she must see everyone else as monsters just like we see her as one, but that's meant to give us better insight into her mental state, not to make us see her as heroic. I'm actually shocked to see your interpretation."
Eden of the East the Movie,The book explicitly calls her out as irredeemably evil within like 1 page of her introduction.
Eden of the East the Movie,"Let's not assume the worst, we haven't seen it yet, but it's certainly possible. But then i can't wait to see all video essays roasting it."
Eden of the East the Movie,"I ultimately disagree with the form of this statement but do concede that they will probably forgo what I remember being an amazing villain from this book for the sake of making her more delectably likable. I don’t think she’s an antihero although I admit it’s been a decade since I’ve read the novel. Sometimes I feel like creators that are white women have a hard time realizing white women have the potential to be evil, manipulative, masochistic, and greedy. I can’t speak to feminism at all, I feel like it’s not my area of expertise by any measure, and I don’t want to over-speculate because I could very well be wrong, but I hope they give us a great villain or if they do go the other route they at least make the story and character riveting without excessively victimizing her."
Eden of the East the Movie,You are just hearing about this now? Florence Pugh was even recently cast in Part 2
Eden of the East the Movie,he is still working on it apparently
Eden of the East the Movie,"Hbo has had its share of garbage shows too, you just remember it with rose colored glasses because of how long its been around and the good shows that were on it."
Eden of the East the Movie,"I'm a big fan of the book. The whole point of the book is that this person is torn apart by contradictory claims on her morality. Pugh was very passive, I felt like she was in the default protagonist mode where she just reacts to what happens without really stopping to think. I never got the sense that she was hesitating about any of it. Of course it could be a director issue, or maybe they just had a different interpretation of the source material. But to me her performance took a really great adaptation down several notches."
Eden of the East the Movie,And she got a role in Dune part 2 too.
Eden of the East the Movie,"I didn't have any particular opinion of her before I watched the show. I think she's much more suited for something like ""Fighting With my Family"", where she's a charming fun person and an audience stand-in. ""Little Drummer Girl"" needed a more nuanced, less likable performance IMO."
Eden of the East the Movie,a traitorous 🐀
Cross Game,"The death game became an entire genre. It's hard to really say which one was first (would need to research the topic, no time right now), but I bet you could easily find something Kaiji could have gotten inspired by, too. Calling plagiarism here is like accusing members of same family because of their similar looks."
Cross Game,"As to the ""Hunger Games"" part, I'd agree it's annoying. As if Hunger Games invented any new qualities. In fact it's all just old good Coloseum, with people who matter having fun at the expense of the lives of those who don't. The definition of those two groups can change depending on context, and games depending on the audience preferences, but the idea is as old as humanity. But people would compare to the freshest/most pronounced thing on their mind."
Cross Game,"The director himself stated its inspired by manga. And tbh its very obvious when watching the show. 

He took those elements and then added in some social drama, and came out with a pretty good result. Sadly, Kaiji, despite being huge in Asia, is pretty unknown around these parts, so your post will probably not gather much attention. 

But to me it was pretty clear watching it, that Kaiji is one of the main influences of the material."
Cross Game,In a lot of ways Battle Royale goes back to earlier sources also of adults sacrificing children or removing certain problems by putting things on a random island (eg stuff like [Hayırsızada Dog Massacre](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivriada) ). Theseus and the Labyrinth is basically dumping a bunch of children in a maze where there is per some versions/retellings the possibility of escape from the Minotaur. The question of I don't need to out run the impossible killing machine monster beast trap...i just need to out run you. WHICH...really goes to the situation with a lot of schools/gpa/curved exams and the sense that your grade will effect everything in your life. Battle Royale just notches it up from aggressive parenting to murder each other for the promise of a good life. Sacrificing children aspect is in things from Li Chi the Dragon Slayer to Abraham and Issac's binding. Hunger Games is just the most recent known for a lot of folks. IDK.
Cross Game,[deleted]
Cross Game,Kaiji is also much better.
Cross Game,"So I've never heard of Kaiji but then I'm not well versed in manga.

Are the characters over exaggerated in manga like anime? Because the characters in Squid Game felt like real humans. Watching Alice in Borderland it was always evident I was watching a tv show.. guy starts blah blah blah I have the solution when there's ten seconds left, like every show where a bomb is dismantled with one second left.. Squid Game felt like someone's desperate story by comparison. It was well acted. There were no annoying stereotype characters (VIPs notwithstanding)

A story about making people do terrible things for others' amusement is nothing new.. as old as time itself."
Cross Game,Just downvotes? No discussion of why you think Im not right? Or maybe you think I am and dont want to accept it?
Cross Game,[deleted]
Cross Game,I was posting about this ever since I saw the first episode of Squid Game so 100% agree.
Cross Game,"Except the similarities can in no way be coincidental, theyre so close to one another as seen in my post. 

For instance, Danganronpa is another Death Game, but has practically no similarities to Kaiji outside the conceit. Squid Game, on top of the similarities I already outlined also deals with the class divide, the struggle of the below working class, the chase of money in death games, etc.

For me its not a question of **if** it took from Kaiji, the evidence is clear, but whether it **took too much**.

Imo? On the whole no, but episode 7 stepped over the line."
Cross Game,"To me it feels like people are comparing the most **westernised** thing, as Battle Royale isnt that old and definitely isnt forgotten"
Cross Game,"Hunger Games was basically just a western version of BR, and clearly just wanted to have its own take on the material. 

The connections to religious or mythological aspects aren't even needed in this regard, as the connection to the source (BR), can be clearly seen. But I'm sure Suzanne Collins is happy for everyone doing so, and not mentioning that she basically just wrote BR fanfic.

Anyway, in this case however, its clearly inspired by a selected variety of media. Kaiji is obviously the biggest influence. I suggest looking it up to see glaring similarities. And the director even confirmed being inspired by reading manga. And given Kaiji's immense success in Asia, its not a hard equasion to solve."
Cross Game,"I dunno. Youve perfectly outlined how Battle Royale is a pretty big evolution and departure from the Theseus and the Labyrinth myth. 

  
Hunger Games, outside maybe the addition of the YA love triangle, really doesn't change that much from BR at all."
Cross Game,"**[Sivriada](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sivriada)** 
 
 >Sivriada (Greek: Ὀξεία, Oxeia) also known as Hayırsızada, is one of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul. The island, which has an area of 0. 05 km², is officially a neighbourhood in the Adalar district of Istanbul, Turkey. Sivriada was often used by the Byzantine clerics as a distant place for peaceful worship, and by the Byzantine emperors as a convenient prison to detain prominent people whom they deemed troublesome.

Cross Game,Did those mangas steal from each other since… they all have the same premise and only minor adjustments?
Cross Game,"Since you're copying & pasting this lie all around Reddit:

[He has stated where he got his inspiration from many times throughout his interviews.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/squid-game-creator-season-2-meaning-1235030617/).

>So I spent a lot of time killing time in comic book cafes, reading. And I read a lot of comic books revolving around surviving death games — manga like Liar Game, Kaiji and Battle Royale.

And from another Reddit user that made a good point:

He also [mentioned that the similarities with Kamisama no Iutoori/As the gods will](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/squid-game-as-the-gods-will-b1933912.html) were purely coincidental:

>Speaking at a press conference, Hwang said that Squid Game had been in development long before As The Gods Will came out.

>""It is true that the first game is similar, but after that, there aren’t any similarities,” he said. “I worked on Squid Game in 2008 and 2009, and at the time, the first game had already been fixed as Red Light Green Light.”

>""It’s not really something that I wanna do, to claim ownership of this story,” Hwang added. “But if I had to say it, I would say I did it first.”

Also, no, they're not the ""exact same premise,"" LOL. Stop spreading misinformation."
Cross Game,">A story about making people do terrible things for others' amusement is nothing new.. as old as time itself.

Well its more than that though isnt it? ***Youre downplaying the similarities on purpose.***   
We're talking a set up about a group of poor people who are rejected by their strict society, lured into a series of deadly game shows for money by a rich upperclass who bet on them. 

One of the games is a dangerous high walk crossing."
Cross Game,There is a massive shilling effort going on by Netflix to advertise this show.
Cross Game,"Thats kinda my point, when is it too much? When do you go from Matrix using elements of Akira to Black Swan ripping off Perfect Blue / Inception stealing from Paprika?

For me its pretty immoral to take someone elses work and present it as your original material. On the whole I think Squid game does enough of its own thing, but the walkway is too blatantly lifting someone elses work."
Cross Game,"> It's hard to really say which one was first

I mean... Kaiji is from 1996, 25 years ago. It's not hard at all to say which came first."
Cross Game,"Now, how many of the America and Europe people who're familiar with Hunger Games know about the original jp Battle Royale? I mean general ""normie"" audiences. Right... ;)"
Cross Game,"Except it is more known and recognized on superficial level. They are both trope filled and filled with specific character types. Take Murakami. If I say Murakami in r/books folks are going to assume Haruki. If I say Murakami in r/horrorlit how many folks might think of Ryu and his (albeit not supernatural) horror novels (Audition...etc). It's not about what came first when pitching something, it's about what folks are familiar with. The god Orcus of broken promises and death gave us the animal name for Orca and William Blake's Orc and possibly the Orc from The Song of Roland. All of that century to centuries before Tolkien decided to use Orc. If I use Orc, should I reference a lesser known deity from ancient times or Tolkien? IDK ymmv. Genre stuff heavily borrows and rewrites from stuff--some tropes so old and from so many different sources its really silly to claim/prove plagiarism unless glaringly obvious and even then can prove tricky. No one owns the farm boy-chosen one, magic sword evil, flood world destruction...etc."
Cross Game,"You can actually say that. Its a thing in Japan(or anywhere really), that when someone does something new that's succesful - and Kaiji was damn successful - the market will get swarmed with people trying their own take on that thing.

I mean just look at the entire shonen genre. Basically always the same show."
Cross Game,"Yeah, it's kind of an never-ending and unsolvable topic I guess. For example im a big Tarantino fan, even though I know his movies are full of almost 1:1 remake shots and themes. I think we´ve just produced so much material that the lines between inspiration, homage, references and plagiarism are just permanently blurred."
Cross Game,"he meant the death game genre in general, not just kaiji and squid game"
Cross Game,"Well there's a big difference isnt there?  
Harry Potter and Percy Jackson are SUPER similar, but one is about secret wizards living in England and the other is about the Greek Pantheon.  


Battle Royale and Hunger Games are both about televised death games where teenagers have to kill each other until there is one left. theyre both criticising media, and the upper class. 

You see? HP and PJ are using chosen one elements to tell different stories, HG is telling the **same story** as BR with a few different aesthetics."
Cross Game,"I see what you are saying... Nothing occurs in a vacuum. And, to be fair, I suppose we could include earlier works like The Running Man, Death Race, and RollerBall in this category... maybe? Depends on how we define it. The creator of Squid Game has cited Kaiji as being an influence, so at least in that particular case it's pretty clear how one story has influenced the other."
Cross Game,"Goddamn, people really fucking love serial killer stories."
Cross Game,Evan Peters' performance was very compelling. I don't care for true crime podcasts or documentary shit at all and I watched this all because of the acting. The parent actors were also really good.
Cross Game,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is one of the worst titles for a TV show I've ever seen."
Cross Game,Seeing how much the general audience doesn't care about The Discourse^TM is always funny.
Cross Game,people watch stranger things 4 without watching the others? or do people just rewatch?
Cross Game,Good chance Wednesday is going to make it there too
Cross Game,"> Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story has now crossed 1B hours viewed **in its first 60 days on Netflix,** becoming just the third series to do so after Squid Game and Stranger Things 4.

Key info in the article that’s excluded from the headline"
Cross Game,Deserved 👏🏻.
Cross Game,"I didn't know much about Dahmer before watching this series. only some vague idea of who he was based on references I absorbed over the years. oddly he was far less terrifying than the monster I had envisioned in my mind but in other ways far more terrifying. I guess I didn't expect the mundanity and sadness of his personality. I imagined him as something else, a deranged criminal mastermind who bent the world to his will. but this was really the story of sad looser who was unable to control his impulses and inability to handle abandonment. fascinating never the less. just a surprising insight into a sick an twisted corner of reality that you could forgive those who lived though for wishing to forget."
Cross Game,the drama around it was the last drop to make me watch it.
Cross Game,"I wonder how much the controversy that was stirred up helped inflate those numbers.

I didn't like the series because it was boring to me, but I'm also exhausted with people who were saying anyone who watched it was disrespecting the victims families."
Cross Game,This makes me worried about Cobra Kai. It did well but not “my spouse is obsessed with serial killers” well
Cross Game,"Cool. 

Can you finish mindhunter now?"
Cross Game,"bUt ItS gLoRiFyInG sErIaL kIlLeRs 🥴

great show though, most deserving out of the three by far imo"
Cross Game,"Never been so disturbed and disgusted, but willing to watch in my life!  So gross, but I want to see more."
Cross Game,"Started watching it and have to admit it was well done, but once I realized that Dahmer would've been the show's number one fan just couldn't bring myself to keep going."
Cross Game,"It is the most popular modern serial killer tale in recent times, and damn good at that. 

Well deserved imo."
Cross Game,People love exploitative true crime dramas.
Cross Game,Gross
Cross Game,"I watched first 3 or 4 episodes and it was bit meh. I mean acting was good, the first episode was tense, but after that the writing was rather bland, it bored me.

Serpent from last year though, was awesome. Entertaining from start to finish."
Cross Game,Lots of sickos in this world.
Cross Game,Nothing batter than giving the glory to rapists and murderers for younger generations!! Wouldn’t ever influence a weak mind.
Cross Game,The people love a good murder porn.
Cross Game,Proof humans are inherently evil.
Cross Game,"It's a gross show written for gross people.

If you're interested in jacking off to someone who took the lives of 16 innocent gay men, you do you, I guess. 

Otherwise, this entire series is grotesque to the point of self parody. I was genuinely insulted after finishing it."
Cross Game,[deleted]
Cross Game,"So the fact that Stranger Things 1,2, and 3 didn't make this implies there are many many people that just watched season 4?"
Cross Game,People love gay serial killers. Who would have thought.
Cross Game,Gross
Cross Game,Am I a non conformist if I’ve never watched any of these?
Cross Game,Does anyone know what that translates into actual viewership numbers ?
Cross Game,I mean squid games was basically Astroturfed.
Cross Game,"historical figure, drama, violence, decent characters and writing, great cinematography and directing. not surprising it ended up being well received"
Cross Game,"Greenlight the Ted Cruz documentary already, what more do you need"
Cross Game,'What makes a person kill' is just one of those eternal questions.
Cross Game,Where is the love for mind hunter then!
Cross Game,"People really liked *this* serial killer show. There's so many bad serial killer shows out there, but give one some actual production value and suddenly mass audiences will check it out."
Cross Game,"Yes and not only that, I watched Dahmer on Netflix and then it started showing me other serial killer on my dashboard ""confession tapes"" and all that and I even saw those and now it keeps suggesting me more and more serial killer or killers in general shows."
Cross Game,"And yet Headhunters was still cancelled…

Edit: Mindhunters"
Cross Game,I mean it's top notch acting all round so it's undoubtably gonna be popular.
Cross Game,That guy is great in American Horror Story / Stories (i get confused) too. The hotel season.
Cross Game,The acting was great all round.
Cross Game,The controversy helped market it. There was a good month of headlines about the show.
Cross Game,It's counting views in the first 60 days.
Cross Game,"Every single time a new season of anything comes out, theres about 70 posts on r/television or the shows sub that consist of ""Do you think I could skip all the other seasons and start with this one?"".  Every. Single. Time."
Cross Game,"genuinely don’t understand the hype for wednesday, feels like riverdale in a gothic theme with a horribly annoying main character"
Cross Game,[deleted]
Cross Game,It’s also way cheaper
Cross Game,We should ask Fincher. I hope he gets back to it after The Killer although I doubt it... Without him they better leave it alone.
Cross Game,"Fincher is the one to talk to about that not Netflix, there is a reason they never cancelled it. If fincher wanted to do anything season it would be very likely to happen"
Cross Game,"From what I’ve read, he said that he wanted to be forgotten and hated all the publicity that came with his murders. So, ironically, the show is technically doing exactly what he *didn’t* want: to be remembered. I guess you could call that some form of poetic justice? I mean, if it goes against a serial killer’s wishes, that’s a win, I guess?"
Cross Game,Most of the violence was off-screen. You only see one violent scene (when he killed his first victim) and maybe the scene from the last episode (when he gets murdered).
Cross Game,[deleted]
Cross Game,You were so disgusted they made this gross show for gross people that you finished the whole thing lol
Cross Game,"> It's a gross show written for gross people.

Says the guy talking about jacking off to Dahmer. Pretty fucking gross!"
Cross Game,Projecting much?
Cross Game,Murder-porn obsessed people are degenerates. Stay clear of these people as they’re typically mentally ill
Cross Game,But how else am I suppose to get my gay snuff fix?
Cross Game,"nah, it’s good telly 👍"
Cross Game,Account sharing and there are other ways to watch it.
Cross Game,"Or maybe people just watched the show out of curiousity. Also, he being gay probably isn't really relevant to the majority of the viewers. People have curiousity about serial killers and they aren't all gays."
Cross Game,"I gave it a shot because true crime is interesting, Evan Peters’s is a good actor and I didn’t really know a whole lot about Dahmer besides the cannibal stuff. Knew nothing about his life or the victims. 

The moment it opens it just pulls you into the creepiness and suspension of what is happening, I had no idea what was going to happen to Tracy Edwards because I didn’t know who he was or how that it was how Dahmer finally got caught. I hadn’t realized 30 minutes had already gone by when he escaped, it was suffocating but excellent television."
Cross Game,"For real. Why are people surpised? It was good. It was well done. In every way. Hands down. I guess we can avoid true crime altogether. And history for that matter. Until everyone is so comfortable, the whole world is fixed."
Cross Game,You forgot to include exploitation of the victims and their families.
Cross Game,"Roses are red, Michael Jackson sang ""Thriller,""  
Ted Cruz __ ___ ______ ______"
Cross Game,"They already made that, it's called Zodiac. Check it out."
Cross Game,"Yeah, I think this was kind of the perfect storm of crossover audience with Ryan Murphy fans and Evan Peters fans too.  I didn't really love it but I do think Peters did a great job."
Cross Game,"I mean, that's generally how the algorithm works.  I would recommend giving it the 'thumbs down' if you didn't like it.   If it's not something in a genre you'd normally watch anyway (true crime, Ryan Murphy. etc.), it's also worth the effort to go to Netflix on your web browser and delete it from your viewing history altogether (don't know why you can't do this through the app on the TV).    
  
I actively vote and engage with the content I watch and my profile is pretty solid with stuff I want to see or am interested in.  I don't seem to have nearly the same issues with the algorithm that I hear people complain about.    
  
I also find it really helps if you go into the 'New & Popular' category once every few weeks or so and scroll through and set reminders for everything that you think looks interesting.  They usually have it broken down like, 'Just Arrived', 'Coming This Week', 'Next Week' & 'Worth the Wait'.  It takes like 5 minutes and that way the things you want show up on your homepage as soon as they become available and it keeps your homepage fresh with similar recommendations outside of those specific titles.  Just my two cents."
Cross Game,It wasn't cancelled like shows usually are. I think it was mainly because of Fincher that the 3rd season didn't get made. He took too long and actors contracts ran out and weren't renewed afaik
Cross Game,The movie with Jaime Lannister?
Cross Game,And fantastic as Quicksilver
Cross Game,got it thanks!
Ping Pong the Animation,"I remember there being an episode of Steven Universe where they brought the director of Kill La Kill or some other Trigger anime, and the difference in animation was like night and day, and all he did were the storyboards. I think it was the episode with Connie hitting someone at school and then Garnet started singing about thoughts or something. "
Ping Pong the Animation,Ping pong might be my favorite anime. Top 3 for sure. 
Ping Pong the Animation,The first time I watched this episode I was high as fuck and man is this episode something when high.
Ping Pong the Animation,This episode is awesome
Ping Pong the Animation,This episode was downright hilarious. 
Ping Pong the Animation,The art in this was fantastic
Ping Pong the Animation,This was one of my least favorite episodes too.
Ping Pong the Animation,God I fucking miss this show. Only one episode that I would consider not good in the entire series and it was a different guest animated one so it wasnt cannon anyway (waterpark one). The other guest animated ones have been really enjoyable too. 
Ping Pong the Animation,One of the best episodes imo
Ping Pong the Animation,"Yep, Takafumi Hori from Trigger. The *general* animation wasn’t super different (at least, as different as this AT ep and normal eps) but it was way more fluid. The man really knows how to animate action. It also helps that there was a lot *to* animate in the episode: the fighting, then the butterfly scene, then the visions near the end of the episode.  
  
But yea, the quality was 👌👌👌"
Ping Pong the Animation,"[Scene from the episode for anyone interested](https://youtu.be/dHg50mdODFM)

Some absolutely gorgeous work"
Ping Pong the Animation,She started singing about thots actually. You're totally right though that episode was gorgeous. I remember some shot or effect with butterflies and it being streets ahead of other SU episodes.
Ping Pong the Animation,Hey Smile! Did you know blood tastes like iron?!
Ping Pong the Animation, Adventure time is over I believe
Ping Pong the Animation,"weird, it was one of my favorites. it felt like it could be used as an educational tool for kids outside of the context of the show, but maybe im remembering it wrong. i think it was a beautiful children's story about the food chain and life. philosophically it ran deep when they would depict the characters living through various past-life forms, so there was a lot for an adult to unpackage as well. 

i only saw this episode once and if im recalling it correctly, it made quite the mark on me. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Yeah, there’s a weird anthology of super absurd and random episodes like this one. I think they were all done by guest animators. But they were always my least favorite episodes because they felt like such vanity projects. I also think this show was at its worst when it did weird for the sake of being weird. That CGI one where princess bubblegum was eating her own hair (“a glitch is a glitch” or something like that) was just dreadful imo. Out of all of those, this episode was probably my favorite though, or at least the most enjoyable compared to the others. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Yh it was kind of just a weird drug trip. Super different in tone to usual AT eps. Then again some of AT’s best were the ones that were more low-key ones, barring the finale: Simon and Marcy, I Remember You, Islands, Stakes, etc. Like, they were out there, but they never need to go *hyper* like this episode to be entertaining. This was just a confusing change in tone and style that didn’t really work. But hey, not all experiments work. And it’s not as bad as \*shudders* the Water Park episode "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Yeah the animation was kinda the same because it was the same studio producing it, and all he did was just basically tell them how he wanted it animated and how the characters should look, something that the Steven Universe crew sucks at. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"One of my favorite scenes and songs from the show.

I also really really wish Estelle could do a whole album in Sugar's style... I like her a lot as an artist, but I want an entire Garnet-like album, though separated from SU. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Right, I forgot."
Ping Pong the Animation,Also one of my favorites. 
Ping Pong the Animation,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."
Ping Pong the Animation,">Flip Flappers  
Land of the Lustrous  
Mawaru Penguindrum  
Noragami  
Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu  
Tanaka-kun is Always Listless  
Tsuritama  
Yona of the Dawn

Aaand you have great taste! Guess I'm gonna need to take recommendations off the rest of this list."
Ping Pong the Animation,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Ping Pong the Animation,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Ping Pong the Animation,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Ping Pong the Animation,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Ping Pong the Animation,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Ping Pong the Animation,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Ping Pong the Animation,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Ping Pong the Animation,Needs more Jojo
Ping Pong the Animation,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Ping Pong the Animation,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Ping Pong the Animation,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Ping Pong the Animation,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Ping Pong the Animation,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Ping Pong the Animation,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Ping Pong the Animation,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Ping Pong the Animation,Madoka magica ! 
Ping Pong the Animation,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Ping Pong the Animation,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Ping Pong the Animation,Awh no your lie about in April 
Ping Pong the Animation,This is actually a really decent list
Ping Pong the Animation,You need to add Hunter x Hunter 2011 to this list

Ping Pong the Animation,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
Ping Pong the Animation,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Ping Pong the Animation,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Ping Pong the Animation,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Ping Pong the Animation,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Ping Pong the Animation,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Ping Pong the Animation,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Ping Pong the Animation,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Ping Pong the Animation,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Ping Pong the Animation,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Ping Pong the Animation,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Ping Pong the Animation,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Ping Pong the Animation,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Ping Pong the Animation,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Ping Pong the Animation,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Ping Pong the Animation,Black Clover?
Ping Pong the Animation,.
Ping Pong the Animation,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Ping Pong the Animation,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Ping Pong the Animation,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Ping Pong the Animation,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Ping Pong the Animation,[deleted]
Ping Pong the Animation,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Ping Pong the Animation,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Ping Pong the Animation,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Ping Pong the Animation,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Ping Pong the Animation,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Ping Pong the Animation,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Ping Pong the Animation,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Ping Pong the Animation,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Ping Pong the Animation,[deleted]
Ping Pong the Animation,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Ping Pong the Animation,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."

Ping Pong the Animation,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Ping Pong the Animation,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Ping Pong the Animation,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Ping Pong the Animation,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Ping Pong the Animation,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Ping Pong the Animation,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Ping Pong the Animation,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.

MAJOR,The Tyler Perry episode of Atlanta was spectacular. That is all. This could go…interestingly for sure.
MAJOR,Madea buys a network
MAJOR,Isn't bet the 24/7 Tyler Perry network anyways?
MAJOR,Tyler Perry presents *I Can Do BET All By Myself*
MAJOR,"If you told me Byron Allen, a man whose name I haven’t heard in 30 years, was working in a gas station, I wouldn’t have blinked.  Turns out he’s a massive success."
MAJOR,I went down a YouTube rabbit hole recently and found out that Tyler Perry is a massive radio controlled model airplane enthusiast. Like he has his own hanger and runway on his estate.
MAJOR,"I remember “Comics unleashed”. 

Couldn’t be more “leashed”."
MAJOR,Bring back 106 & Park
MAJOR,Write some better shows and bring back 106 and park !!
MAJOR,I can't say if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Mostly because I haven't watched BET since I was a kid.
MAJOR,"Honestly, haven’t watched BET in ages and I don’t like any of Tyler Perry’s films. But, I like him. He seems to be a decent man and programming on “Black Entertainment Network” will probably be better if an actual Black person is in charge. 

Just don’t stop broadcasting “Baby Boy” on the regular. This is my only request lol"
MAJOR,At least BET would be owned by Black people for once
MAJOR,Pretty is definitely better than Allen. That man basically got inspired by Tyler Perry and said “how can we do it even CHEAPER!!”
MAJOR,The Boondocks crew would've loved this.
MAJOR,That Atlanta episode is coming true
MAJOR,"Maybe we'll get another season of the Black Panther adult cartoon, the first one is on YouTube and it still holds up."
MAJOR,"God, Byron Allen suuuuucks..."
MAJOR,It’s like finding out Stanley Roper and Al Bundy are competing to buy your company.
MAJOR,I'm still wondering how this guy gets steady work considering his output is the absolute worst.
MAJOR,I thought they were aiming at buying it together.
MAJOR,Put Boondocks back on iTunes!!
MAJOR,Boondocks did that in 2008: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Strike
MAJOR,💀
MAJOR,I’m immune to grits now.
MAJOR,Tyler Perry in Star Trek was a welcomed small role that I didn't expect.
MAJOR,Hellur ratings
MAJOR,"Tyler Perry’s Madea buys a network, by Tyler Perry. 

Exclusively on Tyler Perry’s BET

Brought to you by Tyler Perry."
MAJOR,"Madea buys half a network, makes a new friend, and stars in a line of buddy comedies."
MAJOR,Pretty sure most of his programming moved to OWN years ago.
MAJOR,A madea film
MAJOR,"He’s also a massive asshole. My first job in LA was working for Entertainment Studios. He hired a bunch of us fresh out of college, replaced his entire staff with us, and paid us. $400 a week to work ridiculous hours. It wasn’t until we all banded together and reported him that he started paying people livable wages. 

The man screamed at me in front of the entire office one day. I was late to work because Obama was in town and completely fucked up west side traffic. My normal commute was an hour, but it took me three hours to get into work. He straight up told me no other company would ever give a black man like me a chance in earshot of twenty people."
MAJOR,"Wow. His name is all over the entertainment business news buying stuff.

He is the Marshalls/TJ Maxx of Hollywood buying cheap and spending less."
MAJOR,"Bro, who the fuck is this guy? I'm 50, and this guy has been on TV my whole life, almost exclusively on Saturdays on shows nobody afaik watches. One of the damndest careers in show biz from the outside looking in"
MAJOR,"You do not bet against the man, ever."
MAJOR,I think he owns a news network
MAJOR,That’s wholesome and I’ll remember that factoid forever for some reason
MAJOR,God forbid you post a link to that video - because it sounds just TOO awesome to share with us......now I have to look for myself...
MAJOR,"I've never watched BET, but if what the hell has happened to VH1, MTV and Comedy Central is any indication, no network should ever be run by Paramount."
MAJOR,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert\_L.\_Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_L._Johnson)
MAJOR,"> how this guy gets steady work

he creates it himself! but fr, he started outside of Hollywood and by the time Hollywood had to recognize him, he already was a powerful player."
MAJOR,"People watch it? I mean 90% of TV is trash lol. Adam Sandler produces nothing but equally shitty netflix stuff 90% of the time and he's reddit's favorite.

Being an auteur is not how media companies make billions and billions of dollars."
MAJOR,"This comment is hilarious for some reason. 

“Gets steady work?”

He’s… he’s literally the producer of 95 percent of all entertainment created for black people. 

He’s one of the most successful people in show business, though he doesn’t make a big splash outside of black culture. While “entertainment for black people” is a smaller niche than most entertainment categories, his ability to basically control the entire niche is what makes him so powerful."
MAJOR,They also have the episode where grandpa joins a Tyler perry production. Reality is just a crossover episode
MAJOR,They have no effect on me
MAJOR,"Since 2019 most of his new productions have been for BET or BET+. The Oval, Sistas, Ruthless, Bruh, Assisted Living, All the Queen's Men, Zatima, and a revived House of Payne. All of those shows are still running too. He also makes Young Dylan for Nickelodeon."
MAJOR,I thought this said OAN at first and was *really* surprised.
MAJOR,"god, it makes my head fucking explode every time some jackass reaches some level of success and chooses to keep the industry abuse rolling down the hill. i hope you're at a much better gig now.

(PS, i got obama'd once too on my way home from dropping dvds off at an exec's house.......... the worst)"
MAJOR,"That’s disappointing to read. 

I met him when I was a little kid. He was appearing at a hotel and my family bumped into him outside a restaurant a few hours before his show. My parents invited him to have dinner with us and we had a great time."
MAJOR,Funny because Byron Allen doesn’t remember he’s Black until he’s doing a racial discrimination lawsuit or being the token Black face for a bigger company’s purchase.
MAJOR,[deleted]
MAJOR,"I believe they were the first to introduce reality TV (jersey shore?). Thanks to viewers and the money that came in, everyone other network took note and copied. :("
MAJOR,He does not control the entire niche of “entertainment for black people” - wtf.
MAJOR,Which you can watch for free on YouTube if you Google Boondocks “Pause” episode.
MAJOR,"I've never heard of any of these shows. Like, not even mentioned offhand on a random comment or just browsing the internet."
MAJOR,[Factoid](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/factoid) is in the dictionary
MAJOR,Almost 20 years before Jersey Shore with The Real World. That (following people day to day) and Survivor (for competition shows) are considered the parents of current reality TV.
MAJOR,Is there a single black drama on television outside of Power that isn’t produced by him?
MAJOR,Tyler Perry's audience isn't your average redditor.
MAJOR,"They are your basic multi cam family sitcoms. Kinda like big bang theory and what not, but black."
MAJOR,Ok? You are obviously not the target audience for his shows then.
MAJOR,"First of all, why are you narrowing the “entertainment for black people” to episodic dramas. What about motion pictures + comedies? Black people watch those too!! 

Even in the category of episodic dramas - Snowfall, Queen Sugar, The Harder They Fall, and All Rise come to mind as (black created dramas).

We have some great black created comedies, as you know (which is why you narrowed it) - Abbott Elementary, Atlanta, Insecure, Rap Shit, Black Lady Sketch Show and on and on. Jordan Peele and Ava Duvernay can be counted on for black led motion pictures. 

Tyler Perry appeals to a narrow slice of the Black community. The rest of us moved on a lonnnng time ago."
MAJOR,I'm a black gay guy and I can personally say that I have never heard of any of these shows -that one white politician
MAJOR,"~~Skin color is irrelevant.~~

~~How many of the original Madea plays have you seen?~~

I didn’t understand the joke the first time. Hehe."
MAJOR,"Omg really, you /u/evin90 the emperor of black people have not  heard  about the shows.  Because clearly  you  should be made aware of.

‘You being black is not relevant. Most of his audience is black, it does not mean you have to like his shows."
MAJOR,[I think it is in reference to this incident.](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/politics/im-a-black-gay-guy-viral-tweet-from-pa-gop-candidate-leads-to-social-media-mystery/2591767/)

MAJOR,You’re so right and I wooshed myself hard on it.
MAJOR,"Fair enough. 

Reddit does love cosplaying ""as a blackman..."""
MAJOR,Yeah it took me a minute myself!
MAJOR,Now watch it again and you can catch the twist when it happens early in the episode.
MAJOR,Scrubs had quite a few gut punch episodes but I still think that one hurt the most. Damn good show.
MAJOR,One of the best episodes of television of all time.
MAJOR,"This is #2 on my Scrubs Sad Meter.

1a and 1b are My Lunch and My Fallen Idol. (Season 5)"
MAJOR,"Getting a Disney+ subscription solely for this show 

So good. You’ve got so many amazing episodes coming up. Hope you enjoy steak night!"
MAJOR,God damn that show had some real tear jerkers. I’m not a big cryer but this episode and the transplant episode get me every fucking time.
MAJOR,"You got to watch it without knowing what happens?


If so, GOOD JOB REDDIT for not spoiling it when recommending it


Fun fact: The song at the end, Winter, by Joshua Radin, launched his career. He was Zach Braff's roommate."
MAJOR,"Another really sad one that I don't see mentioned often is from an earlier season where Turk, JD and Elliot are each shown with a patient. During the opening voice over JD specifies that statistically one in three patients admitted to the hospital will die there. The episode takes lots of twists and turns and you try to figure out whose patient is gonna be the one that doesn't make it.

In the end? All three patients die. Because sometimes life is harsh"
MAJOR,"The song ""One Headlight"" by the Wallflowers always reminds me of the feeling of this episode for some reason."
MAJOR,"I just want to compliment you on being so kind as to spoiler mark the episode. I hate the attitude of ""well it's old, you don't need to mark spoilers."" People don't deserve to have plot twists spoiled for them just because something is old. We aren't all able to watch every tv show and movie as it airs, it's unfair to expect people to just deal with being spoiled before just because something came out 20 years ago."
MAJOR,"Echoing what others have already said, an excellent episode and truly gut-wrenching.

It was nice to see this different side to both Cox and Kelso and totally believable in their acting that they could soften and show their more vulnerable side.

Kelso telling Carla about his longtime wife Enid and how what he previously viewed as a flaw of hers reminded him how much he truly cared for her was a nice transition to the funeral when we finally get the reveal."
MAJOR,"I know this one gets brought up a lot, it is a great episode, but my My Lunch/My Fallen Idol is my favorite followed shortly by My No Good Reason/My Long Goodbye are my favorites.  They pull at my heart so much for different reasons.

But yes after that My Screw Up ranks with it and pulls at me too 

I think scrubs is one of the best shows ever, I have not come across another show that blends comedy with serious drama and characters who grow like scrubs.  The way it can be silly, then dead serious and it doesnt feel forced or uneven, it just works"
MAJOR,"Yeah Scrubs has a few of those haymaker moments that just drop you. The ""real"" ending of the show is one of them, probably the best ending to any series ever imo."
MAJOR,First few seasons of Scrubs were amazing. Rest of show is great too but the early years were a whole other level.
MAJOR,"John C. McGinley really shines in this show, Dr. Cox is one of my favorite sitcom characters of all time. Wait til he tells you about bastards lol. Enjoy the show OP!"
MAJOR,"Everybody has their own reasons for loving Brendan Fraser, Scrubs is why I do."
MAJOR,"This was the 1st episode I ever saw of Scrubs. I came home from my hospitality job and it was on late that night on TV. It drew me in because Brendan Fraser was in it and it was just kinda goofy at the start. I remember just sitting there completely mind blown at the end, it was just so well executed. The next few weeks my girlfriend and I went and bought all the available seasons on DVD and binged them haha."
MAJOR,"There are some episodes of TV that really transcend the show they’re on and that was definitely one of them. 

Not to saw scrubs wasn’t a great show, it was, but that episode stood out on another level"
MAJOR,"Ah i envy you!!
One of the best episodes of television ever created. Watched it as kid and it hit me hard and streamed it just last month and tbh it hit me even harder. Just so so damn good. 

Hands down one of my top 5 favorite shows. Enjoy! :)"
MAJOR,"such a good episode! I’m slowly rewatching scrubs, I saw that one a couple months ago and still cried, gets me every time!"
MAJOR,it’s funny seeing this because i’m in the middle of my annual Scrubs rewatch and quite literally just finished watching two episodes that always make my allergies act up. i’m incredibly jealous you get to experience this show for the first time. you have a lot of great episodes to look forward to - both hilarious and emotional ones. enjoy and see ya at steak night!
MAJOR,"Such a heartbreaking episode of a usually upbeat show, but so beautifully acted and written. Always a fave."
MAJOR,Still a brilliant episode. I know the twist and I know all the foreshadowing and I still well up every time I watch it.
MAJOR,Also there's a Scrubs rewatch podcast where Zach and Donald go through each episode.  It's super fun!!!!
MAJOR,"That scene still causes instant waterworks for me. It’s masterful in how devastating it is. 

Gonna go rewatch scrubs for the millionth time now."
MAJOR,"I recently rewatched the series again. That episode gets me with an emotional gut punch every time. It was an incredibly well written episode, with lots of subtle details. >!If you pay attention throughout the episode, after a certain point Ben isn't carrying his camera and taking pictures AND none of the other characters even acknowledge Ben accept for Dr. Cox because he is still trying to process the death of his best friend.!<"
MAJOR,That episode hit so hard.
MAJOR,"This episode was my introduction to scrubs as a 14/15 year old in English, my teacher picked it out so we could do an essay about it for our GCSE."
MAJOR,Don’t watch “season” 9. Great fucking show. It will make you crack up and then rip your heart out.
MAJOR,When I want to pee tears out of my eyes I’ll throw this one on. Honestly one of the greatest episodes and so well written. Even now knowing the ending I still feel caught of guard by the reveal

Into the Badlands,"Really good first season.

It kinda fell apart after that. 

It felt like they were just winging it from Season 2. 

And the writers have a pet favorite character. This character was ok in Season 1 but starting from season 2 the writers were using every possible opportunity to show everyone what a badass they were and this annoyed me so much.

&nbsp;

Also, it's a shame what they did to MK. One of the worst cases of character assassination ever."
Into the Badlands,We never got to see Sonny go Super Saiyan and it still bothers me.
Into the Badlands,"Martial arts were fantastic. Worldbuilding was fantastic. Use of color for the show was fantastic. The ideas in the show were unique. Unfortunately, the acting outside of a handful of the adult actors was OK at best and the overall plot/writing was not all that great (except the first season). it did propel Daniel Wu forward in Hollywood, which I was super happy with. he's great."
Into the Badlands,"It starts fantastic and trails off. I don't think it was supported as it deserved, after a terrific season 1. The story was cool, the action was exciting and it had a unique look. Definitely worth watching."
Into the Badlands,Sonny's bike was a thing of beauty. Was one of my favorites as far as addicting shows and I'm an old school kung-fu movie fan so it was right up my alley.
Into the Badlands,"Was a fan of the first season, they did really great with the story and characters. If you liked this show check out Warrior on HBO"
Into the Badlands,"I enjoy it, something fun to watch that does not take itself too seriously, interesting world, Marton Csokas always brings it, Emily Beecham is great as the Widow, plus all the over-the-top martial arts, it's a little bit silly but also entertaining."
Into the Badlands,"Amazing first season. The baron was such a terrific villain... Who absolutely should not have returned.

Even though the second and third season sucked the choreography was still top notch. Just a shame they didn't really seem to have a vision beyond season 1."
Into the Badlands,I remember liking it. I think it just got overshadowed and underfunded when AMC decided to go all in on TWD.
Into the Badlands,"I loved it and was sad that it got canceled. It went a little off the rails in season three, but overall it was consistently interesting and well done. I wish there were more shows like it."
Into the Badlands,"I love this show. Constant rewatches. I am all about The Widow and how kickass she is. Sunny was so cool to watch. Special badass shout-out to the dude with the metal hand. Nick Frost was effing hilarious. Who knew Lorraine Toussaint could fight? It was great all around. Hate they canceled it, but on Pluto they play it pretty much daily."
Into the Badlands,"I called it ""The Bloody Blade Ballet"" - it was very much my introduction to wuxia. Some of the setting stretched credibility at times, but there were some great characters.

Emily Beecham, who played the Widow, is now in *1899* on Netflix."
Into the Badlands,"Southern gothic-kung fu-dieselpunk-fantasy; It's one of the greatest ideas anyone has ever had, at least for two seasons.

They killed off Quinn, then brought him back, but he was so damn good it was worth it, then when he was gone, they took the surprisingly sympathetic Minerva and made her the villain, which was, IMO, a huge mistake.

I thought Sunny and MK were the worst actors, sidelining their stories in season 2 was a great idea.  I'm happy to see MK got a little better at acting in Ms Marvel.  BHAJI!  Nick Frost being a kung-fu master makes me insanely happy.

They had a really cool mobile game, too, but I hit the wall where they expect you to start paying to progress and I backed off.

*Don't* ***SKULK*** *in the SHAdows.  If yer here to kill me have the decency to show your faces.*

\-Quinn. *The best delivery of any line ever.*

&#x200B;

If you want a recommendation for something equally weird, Try Dean F Wilson's Coilhunter Chronicles and Great Iron War audiobooks, read by RC Bray, and CD Espeseth's Visions, read by Rhys David.  The narrations of both are amazing, and they are fun, weird genre mashups."
Into the Badlands,"Emily Beecham played my favourite character. She absolutely shone in the role of The Widow, the physicality, the attitude, the fashion!

I will now watch anything she's in, including 1899."
Into the Badlands,"The first season was amazing. It became one of my favorite shows immediately. I was super excited to learn that that the second and subsequent seasons would have higher production, better fight scenes, etc. 
However, the rest of the seasons after the first were terrible. I kept trying, and when they added Nick Frost, it just got worse. So much worse"
Into the Badlands,So much wasted potential.
Into the Badlands,Just couldn't get into it. It seemed too silly.
Into the Badlands,"I heard endless praise for its fight scenes and choreography, so I very excitedly picked it up. Never quite understood that hype, as it just seemed to be largely fast cuts and camera tricks? Maybe I didn't get far enough in, because ""TV series with excellent martial arts choreography"" is generally number one on my wish list at any given time.

The setting was pretty cool though."
Into the Badlands,"I enjoyed it for many of the same reasons you've pointed out. It had a unique look, and the action was exciting. I think that the story got too convoluted towards the end of the third season."
Into the Badlands,I also liked it. It had totally bats#*t energy and I was here for it! I would say His Dark Materials gives me similar vibes but minus the wire-fu.
Into the Badlands,I loved it and really wish it got season to properly close things out.
Into the Badlands,I gave up on it when the easy assassination of that black leader was fucked up.
Into the Badlands,"I thought the premise was interesting and was enjoying what I saw. But, they sandwiched it between Walking and Talking Dead, so when that franchise took a severe nose dive, I basically stayed off of AMC, so never really saw beyond the first season."
Into the Badlands,"One my all time favorite shows. Best fight scenes I've ever seen on a TV show. Fantastic show that never got pushed by AMC because there were no zombies in it.

Lewis Tan was a great addition late in the game."
Into the Badlands,"Phenomenal all around, never read the source. I also didn't think it was cancelled, just ended?"
Into the Badlands,If the writing and some of the acting was half as good as the action that show would've been truly great.
Into the Badlands,"I like the premise more than the show itself. A lot of cool ideas and visuals but it was just kind of...mediocre? I feel the same about a lot of AMC shows - Into the Badlands, Hell on Wheels, Dark Winds. All had/have potential but there's something corny about them that I don't really enjoy."
Into the Badlands,It would've been a really good show if it had good to great acting. Season 1 was cool but then MK's terrible acting became unbearable in season 2 and I had to stop.
Into the Badlands,It was enjoyable but forgettable
Into the Badlands,"It's in my mind every time I see a 100s of million dollar budget movies do fight scenes with shaky cam, quick cuts, pitch dark and high zoom to hide the zero work they put into the scene.

I always think Badlands did it weekly with much less  budget and time. Love to see a revisit of that world."
Into the Badlands,I hated MK’s acting so so so much.
Into the Badlands,Good thing i stopped when whatshisname was captured or whatever. I really started hating on the vibe
Into the Badlands,"Minerva is the best character, she's so good I don't hate the name Minerva anymore, which I did for as long as I could remember."
Into the Badlands,"I loved this show. Best fight scenes I have ever seen on a TV show.

AMC (even to this day) threw all of its resources and marketing at Walking Dead. I think TWD was the lead in on Season 1 or 2 which helped, but they really didn't care about it.

A certain death in Season 2 was not very satisfying and it led to a shift in narrative and where the show was going. Seasons 3 and 4 were quite different from the first 2"
Into the Badlands,"The rating decline for the show was very real with the tail end of the last season being a shadow of its former ratings (typically getting 1.5-3 million to struggling to be above .5 million) and for this kind of show, a rating decline that hard on traditional airing is a quick path to death."
Into the Badlands,Dam I wondered what had happened to it. Thought it might have been put on hold because of the big C. :/
Into the Badlands,Two very good seasons and one season that made me think it should have been canceled after season 2.
Into the Badlands,"They also wrote out Sarah Bolger at the same time, and that combined with the death, kind of soured me on the show a little....

Still - I would gladly have watched a season #4."
Into the Badlands,"Yeah, it feels like it was meant to end after season 2 and they had to come up with a bunch of stuff to keep it going. I felt sad because Sunny worked so hard to reunite with Veil and and she died so their whole goal since the beginning had failed

I will say Lewis Tan was a big bright spot in an otherwise very different season. I am now a big fan of his"
Into the Badlands,I disagree. The world building with Azra and hints of the Widow and Sunny’s past starting to come together. I like how their past never felt like the A plot but always seemed to drive the characters.
Into the Badlands,I can always enjoy the show for the fight scenes. Nick Frost and Emily Beecham we’re easily the best parts about it. Actor that plays MK got super whiny and annoying.
Into the Badlands,"Was it prestige television? No. 

Was it fun television? Yes."
Into the Badlands,I really enjoyed this show. Was sad when finished. More would be great!
Into the Badlands,"I love that show, its fun to watch minus Mk, Mk is a bitch"
Into the Badlands,"When they go full Crouching Tiger, this show went full fucking awesome.  Loved it.  So upset we didn't see Sonny use his powers.  I wanted him to go Super Saiyan damnit.  The dude took on multiple darkones and survived, could you even imagine what a fully powered up Sonny would be capable of?"
Into the Badlands,"I liked the first season very much.

The later seasons, not so much.

One character in particular got too much attention. She suffers the same fate Arya Stark in the last few seasons of GOT- she was... too empowered by the writers.

It was clear the writers favored her, maybe a little too much. 

She only exists to deliver badass lines and make badass fight scenes and kick ass. 

There is also a case of an overload of ""special"" characters. Remeber when Darkones first appeared, they were super strong and special. By the last season there was an army of them. ""If everyone is Super, no one will be"".

I don't know what they did with MK. He was kind of meh in s1, but holy shit he got annoying later on."
Into the Badlands,"It was great show, really enjoyed."
Into the Badlands,"The writing and some acting is really bad, but there is no show that comes close to their version of modern martial arts."
Into the Badlands,I loved this show!  I really wish that it hadn't gotten rushed/ended.  It was unique and deserved far better.
Into the Badlands,I was into it for a while in the first season then it just became too much r/mallninjashit/ for me to swallow.
Into the Badlands,"I gave up after season 2, but the fight scenes were so much fun!"
Into the Badlands,"It got worse with each season, but I still enjoyed it."
Into the Badlands,i stuck with it.  the criticisms in this thread are completely valid but i enjoyed the fight scenes too much and frost's scenes were enjoyable at least
Into the Badlands,"Its totally ridiculous and I love it.  The Widow is one of my favorite characters in recent memory and the fight scenes are insane.  Show kind of suffered once the villain from the first 2(?) seasons was no longer around though, he was fantastic."
Into the Badlands,"Fun to watch, can barely remember anything plot related.

Would have been a great show if they could have nailed the story."
Into the Badlands,The setting was awesome and sort of unique and of course the fight scenes were the highlights
Into the Badlands,I watched and enjoyed season 1 and then forgot it existed. I should pick it up again.
Into the Badlands,"It was enjoyable for the first two seasons, I had a good time, but it lost me after few episodes into season 3"
Into the Badlands,"What do y'all like about it? I watched the first episode and was like ""Ok, so it's the dark ages but we aren't calling it that"" and it just didn't hook me. It kind of felt like the Tudors."
Into the Badlands,"I loved the first season, I tried really had with the rest but the show made a mistake getting rid of Quinn and basically everything relating to MK."
Into the Badlands,"MK was shit yes, but I will totally respect their casting choice because they got someone who's a fighter first and then an actor! Cuz his acting was baaaad."
Into the Badlands,Emily Beecham was just amazing.
Into the Badlands,Agreed. Kid was like a cockroach lol never died
Into the Badlands,I want to see their interpretation of his discovery of the gun. It leads me to believe the theory that it’s set in the future and dystopian rather than in the past.
Into the Badlands,"I enjoyed MK in season 1.

Season 2 started the hate.

Season 3 made me want him see him beaten up by Sonny, again, and again, and again...."
Into the Badlands,That’s what I’m sayin! I wanna see what happened with him or his son. I was salty so get to the final episode just to see that literally EVERYONE is using it except for Sunny lol
Into the Badlands,"I would’ve much rather had them go into Sunny’a backstory, and I would’ve liked to see him get his power back. But like you said, they definitely went much farther into the Widow. It made me finishing the series feel kind of pointless, because, you know what happens at the end lol. If they bring it back, I want to see what happens with his son, Henry. Not the Widow."
Into the Badlands,The choreography of some fight scenes was just amazing. And this is me as a wuxia and hk cinema tragic.
Into the Badlands,The fighting/ martial arts was so fun
Into the Badlands,"plot and writing isn't the best, but the fight choreography is excellent"
Into the Badlands,"agree, Quinn is an unforgettable character. The faction storyline got away from them. I still liked and enjoyed the storylines but season one was my favorite."
Into the Badlands,For sure. Sonny wasn’t the best actor either lol.
Into the Badlands,It always amazes me when I find out the actor is English!!
Into the Badlands,"I mean it's clearly the far future. there are modern buildings left desolate, ruined architecture, the shell of a modern city. I'm not sure how anyone could interpret that it's set in the past"
Into the Badlands,"I mean, it's extremely obvious it's in post-post warfare world? Are you sure you binged it?"
Into the Badlands,I mean they talked about how everyone basically agreed no guns in the first episode
Into the Badlands,*Sunny
Into the Badlands,"Agreed. Obviously The Widow is incredible as well, but I think they also made the mistake of going to wide with their storyline instead of focusing on what made the first season great."
Into the Badlands,"That was more than likely scripting. The writing was pretty shit tier save for maybe the first season. Dude is a pretty decent actor, but he's mostly known for hong kong action movies"
Into the Badlands,They used a subway station as a base of operations
Into the Badlands,"Yeah, I knew before then, obviously like with the cars they drove. Lol but when I first started watching I didn’t think so."
Into the Badlands,Yeah I’m pretty sure lol. Memory just must be shit. I haven’t watched it in a month or two.
Into the Badlands,"good bye you crazy kung fu western sci fi dieselpunk Irish Cajun apocalypse, never gonna be another one like this."
Into the Badlands,Bajie was the best. I liked this show. It wasn’t cliffhanger drama but it was fun to watch
Into the Badlands,As someone who hasn't had cable since season 3 started so haven't been able to catch up... Did this show have closure? I know season 3 wasn't planned to be the last. I want to finish it but if it ends on a cliffhanger I'm not gonna bother.
Into the Badlands,"It’s basically a Post-apocalyptic. Action. Martial Arts Show. It would’ve been hard to pull off on a movie budget, the fact it even exists is amazing to me, and i think it’s an amazing feat of the entire team. Would love to see more stuff like this. (I’ve heard about warrior but can’t get that here atm)"
Into the Badlands,"This was never a great show, but it has been a consistently entertaining one. I like the mix of melodrama and ridiculous martial arts."
Into the Badlands,"finished season 1 today and definitely watch if ur a fan of martial arts, nothing quite like it on TV"
Into the Badlands,"Absolutely LOVED season 1 and then a couple of episodes into season 2 I stopped.  Gone were the slick one-shot, smooth action scenes.  Instead I was seeing the same dumb, quick-cut, jerky hollywood style scenes that I can't stand.  Does season 3 get better?"
Into the Badlands,"i love this show but this finale was meh...
i was SOOOOOOOOOO happy when a certain annoying as fuck character was killed by the Widow!!!  i clapped out loud at that part! LOL. 
i was hoping we'd see that Sunny's ""locked"" gift would be something totally badass and powerful but what we got was meh...especially since we'll never get a real chance to see him utilizing it (for what the Master had told him was in store for him). 

i love Tilda and i am choosing to believe that she made a full recovery.  i used to love MK but i have hated him for a while now.  the character's one teeny, tiny semi-bit of redemption (barely) is that he clearly remembered his initial friendship with Tilda (back in season 1) and he didn't want to kill/mortally injure her because of that once upon a time friendship.  i like that (i don't know how to do spoiler tags, so i'm trying not to spoil anything) MK became the MK from season 1 (a good thing!) when he realized he had hurt Tilda. 

i have to say i was impressed with Nick Frost's acting (when he was crying) in the finale.
oh, i thought the very ending with that blonde dread hair guy finding the gun and then shooting it at the camera/at us was really dumb."
Into the Badlands,"I loved this show, was so disappointed when it was cancelled."
Into the Badlands,"If anyone wants a cooler series with martial arts in it, check out Warrior."
Into the Badlands,I got into this show right before the last few episodes. It’s insane in a good way. I enjoyed the hell out of it. Nick Frost as human king fu panda ruled.
Into the Badlands,I'm really curious when the show decided to stop being a lose adaptation of Journey to the West / planned to come back to that plot.
Into the Badlands,"I don't get how this show got multiple seasons. The acting was hilariously bad.  
The concept was awesome but in my opinion they failed to capture it."
Into the Badlands,Is it worth a watch?
Into the Badlands,Try Warrior on Cinemax
Into the Badlands,The fact that they made *Nick Frost* into a believable martial arts badass is amazing to me. Other movies and shows really have no excuse. ^still ^salty ^over ^Iron ^Fist
Into the Badlands,Can’t believe it’s over now
Greenleaf,"Keith David has one of those voices that when you hear it you go “Keith David”. It’s distinct and amazing and I will watch anything with him in it or voicing in it. 

Also he was Goliath in Gargoyles."
Greenleaf,Now there's a man who knows how to marry his cousin
Greenleaf,Flame king
Greenleaf,"The president?      
       
How is green leaf?"
Greenleaf,"“I know it’s beautiful, but I didn’t just take it out for air.” - Requiem for a Dream"
Greenleaf,Panicked for a minute. Thought he had died
Greenleaf,This man is a goddamn national treasure.
Greenleaf,I'm still waiting on that Keith David / David Keith buddy cop flick.  Somebody's just got to cast that.
Greenleaf,"Fuck yeah, Goliath."
Greenleaf,Keith David is the goat.
Greenleaf,">Before we talk about Greenleaf, but I have to ask you about Road House. You’re one of the first credited actors on the film and originally had a much bigger role. What happened?
Road House was great. Road House got me into my new car and it moved me into a new apartment. It was a four-week job that turned into 11 weeks. I had a great role. I got to fight with Terry Funk and a couple of other guys. I had a really good time. The day after the wrap party, [the director] Rowdy Herrington called me. He said, “Keith, I’ve got three and a half hours of movie that I’ve got to cut down to 2:15, so I’m sorry, buddy, but you’ve got to go.”

wait... there's a 3 hour cut of Road House, and Keith David was left on the editing room floor.

How do we lobby to get the Keith David Cut?"
Greenleaf,"If they ever do a Community movie I really hope he comes back for it, for being a very late addition to the show Keith David was fantastic and I would love to see more Elroy Patashnik."
Greenleaf,"That is such an awesome interview. The man really does elevate any project he's a part of, regardless of screen time. And he seems immensely charismatic too."
Greenleaf,I’m in. Green leaf was so good
Greenleaf,I have noticed this show on avclub but never on here or elsewhere..did a search on this reddit and nothing shows up.. anyone here watch it? any good?
Greenleaf,"I've been watching it. It's pretty good. The main actress is great and so is Keith David. The teenage daughter seems more realistic than most teenagers in shows.

The only major problem is that it seems a little slow and sometimes really boring. It's taking 13 episodes to tell a 10 episode story. 

One of the best parts about this show is the setting. I've never seen a show set in a megachurch before. The interesting setting makes it a little more than just another family drama. "
Clangers,Excited about this!
Hap and Leonard,The first season was real good. The second season about the kids and the church wasn't that good
Hap and Leonard,"Hap and Leonard was a delight to watch, all three seasons of it. The performances were especially captivating; it really had a fantastic cast. It's also incredibly relevant right now, given its themes of modern racism and how it survived and thrived in rural, Southern parts of the US. It's a bummer it didn't get more seasons, but each season is pretty self-contained so it doesn't feel like it was cancelled on a cliffhanger or anything. It's 100% worth a watch for those who haven't seen it."
Hap and Leonard,[deleted]
Hap and Leonard,I loved this show. I too was upset when they dropped it. I wish they could have finished the book series.
Hap and Leonard,"Weird to see people here say that they didn't like the second season. It was widely considered the best one. It had a very different tone compared to S1, though."
Hap and Leonard,I really enjoyed every minute of that show.  Thanks for reminding me. Time to watch it again.
Hap and Leonard,This show just didn't work for me. It just tries to hard.
Hap and Leonard,/r/doesitresolve ? I've been meaning to watch it for years.
Hap and Leonard,"Season one was good, two was okay, three was quite bad. The ending of the third season made me mad, and ensured I wouldn't recommend anyone watch the show past season one."
Hap and Leonard,What show?
Hap and Leonard,"Yeah, I thought I was the only one who just dropped it in the 2nd season.  I believed they only had 6-episode seasons, but the 2nd one felt like twice that.  Even Brian Dennehey couldn't save it."
Hap and Leonard,What about the third season?
Hap and Leonard,I only seen the first season. And part of the second season.  I got really into it cuz i knew some of the places they talked about in East Texas
Hap and Leonard,I think Mickle is the best American true Indie Director
Hap and Leonard,It was a TV show about two Elmore Leonard characters. Liked the first season a lot (with Christina Hendricks) - after that - not so much.
Hap and Leonard,It got canceled in the middle of the third season.
Hap and Leonard,"It’s Joe Lansdale actually, but he’s clearly an admirer. The Hap books draw a lot from Leonard."
Hap and Leonard,But it's the same length of 6 episodes like season 2 was? Also I was more asking if you thought season 3 was better than season 2 or did it not recover?
Hap and Leonard,But there was a 3rd season. The cancellation had no effect on it. And it pretty much ended on the last ep.
Hap and Leonard,My bad. Thanks for letting me know!
Hap and Leonard,"Nooooo! Some may disagree, but for me this cancellation stings the most "
Hap and Leonard,"I really liked the show. Some of the dialogue was really clever.

Seasons one and two were delightful. Season three didn't work for me as well, but I was still looking forward to a fourth.

This is a bit of a shame. "
Hap and Leonard,Everyone loves Jimmi Simpson for Always Sunny and Westworld but [Hap and Leonard is my favorite role of his.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSrRPow7K9Q)
Hap and Leonard,Bad news keep coming.  It was really an underrated show. I enjoyed all three season and ı was hoping for  fourth season but ıt is just dust now.  I am gonna miss characters' chemistry.
Hap and Leonard,Damn this was a show I have yet to watch but has been on my radar for a while. Ill have to check it out knowing theres only 3 seasons to binge through.
Hap and Leonard,Dang. No more Nilla wafers and Dr. Pepper
Hap and Leonard,"I never got around to after season one, even though I liked it, so I guess I'm one of those people who should be blamed.

But there's just so much TV."
Hap and Leonard,"bummed out because it was maybe my favorite show on currently, but I'm not exactly surprised. glad they made it this far, Jim Mickle is perfect match for adapting Lansdale."
Hap and Leonard,With B99 brought back by NBC this becomes \-by far\- the saddest news of this upfront session.
Hap and Leonard,"Watched it since it debuted a couple years back. I wish others could have seen it, but that's TV these days. For anyone curious, I think it's still on Netflix."
Hap and Leonard,Goddamnit!
Hap and Leonard,"Damn. Of all the recent cancellations, this is the most disappointing."
Hap and Leonard,Without a doubt one of my favorite shows I came across by accident.  I will be looking forward to the final season when it hits Netflix.
Hap and Leonard,I'm super sad about this one. This hurts as much as B99 for me. 
Hap and Leonard,Social Media is a lie. Delete your social media accounts. Break Free.
Hap and Leonard,"This always reminded me of a more grown up Dukes of Hazard.

I liked it without loving it but I could live with 6 episode series. The main characters chemistry was great, I thought.

Shame to see it go"
Hap and Leonard,"I have never ever heard of this show, is it worth watching?"
Hap and Leonard,No! I think that show is so smart.
Hap and Leonard,"This one actually hurts worse than B99 did for a while there, I *loved* Hap and Leonard. It was so much fun to watch and the leads played off each other extremely well. A lot of the dialogue and plot was handled super good too.

I'm not surprised considering I never ever saw it advertised anywhere, but it still really fucking sucks."
Hap and Leonard,"Just a fantastic show. Between this and The Expanse, this has been a crazy week!

For as funny as it could be and often was, it presented such a head-on depiction of race relations in America. The show rarely shied away from the conflicts that could arise from a gay black Vietnam vet and a white hippie growing up as adoptive brothers in the South in the '80s. It's like a sitcom premise that catalogued the very real repercussions that would likely come about.

Season One was all right, but Two and Three were both a couple of my favorite seasons of TV in general. Would've been up for several more seasons with this cast and crew, but I'm glad we got what we did. Ending on either of the last seasons would've hurt even worse."
Hap and Leonard,"I’ve been so sad about this since news broke. From what I’ve read, ratings were up and the audience might not have been huge but was loyal. I’ve had a hard time letting go. "
Hap and Leonard,I am hurting as well.  I just found this show on Netflix.  
Hap and Leonard,Yep.  Absolutely loved the show and I’m crushed.
Hap and Leonard,"if you like the show you can always check out the books, the show was basically a pitch perfect adaptation of them"
Hap and Leonard,I enjoyed him in Psych
Hap and Leonard,The season 3 finale makes for a decent series finale. It ends on a somber note but it’s not a cliffhanger.
Hap and Leonard,"> But there's just so much TV.

It's a double edge sword. There's so much so everyone can find something they like but when there's so much there's not always enough people to keep the show running. "
Hap and Leonard,"If you like noir, drama, comedy, action, mystery its really good. It's also based off of books that are really good as well."
Hap and Leonard,"I 2nd this. Happened to see the first season as it aired. Wanted to know more about the creators. I found out about the books and started reading them. 

I don't think any show has captured a book so perfectly and made a great tv show at the same time. Literally four minor changes happened in the 1st season. 

One was the book mentioned the hunting dogs and in the show they're just portrayed as dogs kept out in the yard. 

The second, I don't want to spoil anything but I'll simply say that they change the location of something. They're still in the same area and everything but they only change the location by like 20 feet. 

The 3rd thing all they change is something was outside the house and in the show its inside the house. 

4th was how Hap and Leo met. Hap and Leo met in the book as laborers working a rose farm. In the show they said they met as kids. 


I cannot think of a show that changes so little from a book to a movie or show. They even took dialogue from the book and put it into the show. "
Hap and Leonard,"Okay so since you seem to have seen the whole series, can you tell me if its funny? I have a bunch of real serious/grim serialized shows I watch and have been looking for a serialized show with a heavy dose of comedic acting/writing. (Preacher comes to mind but Justified may be a better comparison for the genre)"
Hap and Leonard,"That's a nice way to put it.

Can't really see it changing though, so we'll likely see more stuff slip through the cracks."
Hap and Leonard,"Alright, I might check it out sometime. If it had a satisfying ending that is. Did it? "
Hap and Leonard,"It’s definitely not a heavy does of comedy. The first season is pretty balanced but gets darker by the end of the season and as the series gets darker the comedy wanes. 

[Happy!](https://youtu.be/H4gFlDn6c0c) comes to mind. It gets darker and funnier but maintains an even balance of both throughout the first season and it’s coming back for a second.

What about [The Good Place](https://youtu.be/uC8xkAnYSfk)? It’s more funny than dark but it gets darker and stays funny. "
Hap and Leonard,"It's a drama with moments of comedy here and there.  Justified and Preacher are definitely similar.  It's not as bizarre as Preacher, but few shows are."
Hap and Leonard,Each season is its own standalone story based on the books. So really you get 3 endings and I think they're all good. Really each season is just a long movie.
Hap and Leonard,Happy! was my sleeper hit from 2017. I really love that show as well as The Good Place. As long as there is some comedy in Hap and Leonard and it doesnt take itself too overly serious Im sure Ill be into it. I may start the first episode now actually.
Hap and Leonard,Hap and Leonard maintain a plucky friendship throughout the series even when it gets darker so it sounds like it’s a good fit.
Hap and Leonard,I really enjoy this show. I think I'm gonna have to pick up the books. 
Hap and Leonard,"Hell yeah! The books were great. Basically about two badasses (which incidentally one is like a gay badass Chuck Norris who is a republican, and the other a straight draft-dodging liberal) who develop a strong brotherly bond with each other.  They're like amateur sleuths who happen to clash with pedophiles, the KKK, the mafia, secret group of hitmen, etc. The characters are hilariously crafted and the shit they do together is LMAO.  Joe Lansdale is the man!!"
Hap and Leonard,Probably the most under appreciated show owned by AMC/Sundance. They should air it on both networks it's so good 
Hap and Leonard,This is one of the few shows that my wife and I actually buy on Amazon as each episode airs. We've got the second half of this season ready to binge.
Hap and Leonard,so is the show any good? what is it like?
Hap and Leonard,Love the 6 episode format of this show. Hope this is copied more in the future. 
Hap and Leonard,"Been watching it since episode one. It's great, and I'd recommend it to anyone. "
Hap and Leonard,Yes!
Hap and Leonard,I've only seen the first season but I loved it.  Gonna binge watch all of the second season eventually.
Hap and Leonard,Is season 2 out on streaming yet? Loved Season 1.
Hap and Leonard,This is one of those shows I should probably watch more but never get around to it.  I've seen a few episodes from the first season and liked it but just never got back to it.  
Hap and Leonard,I like the show but found the first season much more entertaining. Here's hoping the 3rd season is more like the first than the second.
Hap and Leonard,Cool.
Hap and Leonard,"Marathoned the first season on Netflix. Completely different than what I thought it would be, especially since I thought they were cops or Texas Rangers from an advertisement I saw. The second half of Season 1 was crazy in a good way, but parts of it are a little dull or kind of weirdly written."
Hap and Leonard,I want to buy them as well but every day they go up in price because of this show. Late last week the 1st book was $8 used and I was going to buy them but decided against it now it's going for $11 and a new copy is $12.
Hap and Leonard,Say what...? There are books? I'm watching the second season as I write. It's a really good show. I'ma have to get the books too.
Hap and Leonard,"I have read the first five and love them.  They are good stories told in simple, yet effective language.  The characters are believable, and the dialogue is fantastic. I would definitely recommend them if you are a fan of the show."
Hap and Leonard,I remember me and our friends faces in the last 15 minutes of that final episode. Season 2 was an amazing mystery 
Hap and Leonard,"it's kinda got that buddy comedy going on, i really like the books and the first and second season are pretty different, with the second being more serious.  Try out season 1 and see if you like it. "
Hap and Leonard,"Its like a buddy cop show that can get pretty serious at times

[light hearted buddy cop moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNz6L_0RjnI)

[Serious moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkR3luof_zo)"
Hap and Leonard,It is hipster bullshit from top to bottom. 
Hap and Leonard,"This thread is already more active than the Hap and Leonard sub has been for 3 seasons. It’s a great show, based on an incredible series of books, and deserves a lot of love. "
Hap and Leonard,what rock have i been under!? I love MKW and terriers. The trailer looks great and has heaps of great actors. Sign me up! Thanks.
Hap and Leonard,I have never watched Terriers but I agree Hap & Leonard is awesome.
Hap and Leonard,Hm. I feel like Hap & Leonard scratches my Justified itch more than my Terriers itch. All great shows though.
Hap and Leonard,"Jimmi Simpson plays a villain, that should be all you need to start watching."
Hap and Leonard,"I LOVE TERIERRS!!!! A million upvotes for even mentioning the series name since not a lot of people know It exist since its cancelation after season one on FX!  Now, I will absolutely watch Hap & Leonard!"
Hap and Leonard,The first season felt like it would've been much better as a one and a half hour movie than a short season long show. It was too slow and spent time on stupid stuff that wasn't really interesting multiple times. Without the pacing problems it would've been a good wonky buddy movie with unrealistic villains.
Hap and Leonard,"I tried the first season when it came out because it looked like the perfect show to fill the spot Justified left when it ended, but I stopped after a few episodes. i don't know, but something was missing. I do want to get back to it. I hear it gets better."
Hap and Leonard,"if you liked Terriers, Mad Dogs on Amazon is by the same creator and is really good "
Hap and Leonard,"Agree 100%. Very good show, it deserves a lot more attention!"
Hap and Leonard,"You had me at ""if you liked Terriers""."
Hap and Leonard,But did he turn or not!? A question that will never be answered. I loved Terriers. 
Hap and Leonard,"I really enjoyed the first season, but the 2nd just fell flat for me.  Whereas the 1st season was over before I knew it, the 2nd season just seemed to drag, and I was only around halfway through the season (only six episodes) when I realized this and stopped watching it.  Watched it live as it aired on Sundance, BTW.  "
Hap and Leonard,I did enjoy terriers will give it a watch when I've finished my current tv show backlog. 
Hap and Leonard,I did like Terriers so perhaps I will
Hap and Leonard,"I’m loving the new season, I think it’s the darkest and funniest one yet. Love their chemistry, I think it only gets better "
Hap and Leonard,"I enjoyed S1, and S2 seems to be keeping the same pace of storytelling and outstanding acting. "
Hap and Leonard,Thank you. I was looking for something to get into and this looks exactly like what I was looking for. The fact that it has Omar in it is just too good. Wont be coming out of my room for the next couple days.
Hap and Leonard,do it!
Hap and Leonard,I really liked Terriers. Was sad when it got canned. 
Hap and Leonard,"> Hap & Leonard scratches my Justified itch

...aaand Hap and Leonard just jumped to the top of my viewing order!"
Hap and Leonard,He graduated from the same small college I'm at in rural Pennsylvania. The whole theatre department out here embraces whatever project he works on. Big inspiration for us.
One Punch Man,"No studio or date, but S3 has finally been announced.

J.C. Staff (who animated S2) is unlikely to return."
One Punch Man,Please lord let Madhouse do season 3
One Punch Man,One of my favorite anime. Saitama is one of the best written OP character along with Mob from Mob Psycho. Both are written by the same person ONE.
One Punch Man,"About fucking time. I was worried the English VAS would die of old age by this time.

I understand that logistics behind the scenes can be troubled but animation & film making should be more efficient than ever."
One Punch Man,"As someone who really struggles to get invested in Anime, is this worth a try? 

Got hooked on AOT (despite some of the tropes like constant yelling, those still shots of weird faces w/sweat or whatever) and loved it. Opposite end of the spectrum - I just could not get into FMA: B, just never clicked for me. 

Love castlevania on Netflix."
One Punch Man,"More like season 1 than season 2 please. 

Session 1 was special,  season 2 was generic anime filled with all the gross tropes i hate"
One Punch Man,hope mad house creats
One Punch Man,Who the vegeta looking guy?
One Punch Man,I wonder if this will be an One-Punch man season or another *SideCharacters'* season.
One Punch Man,I’ve watched season 1 five times already. I couldn’t finish season 2….
One Punch Man,Best headline I read all night
One Punch Man,This is truly a great day.
One Punch Man,Great news! But it doesn't mention what Studio would be doing the animation?
One Punch Man,"J.C. Staff isn't the only problem that season three is going to face, the manga went off the rails with the plot and the pacing is so fucked that it's pretty much unadaptable now. It'd be better if they just directly adapted straight from the webcomic as not only is the pacing way faster there but the conclusion to the arc itself was more satisfying."
One Punch Man,Please no weird 3d shoulders :/
One Punch Man,Please God. Take your time. Do not have a repeat of 2
One Punch Man,"Guys the animation is not the reason why season 2 is bad or is the problem season 3 will face. The arcs that season 2 and season 3 will adapt is when the manga goes to shit, the pacing and storytelling is so bad now."
One Punch Man,“BuT cAn hE bEaT gOkU”
One Punch Man,need the s1 team
One Punch Man,And the fans will still hate it regardless of how good or bad it is.
One Punch Man,The studio that made season 2 should be banned from making content for anything ever again
One Punch Man,I know nothing about 1 punch man but is that vegeta?
One Punch Man,"awful, unfunny, boring show."
One Punch Man,FINALLY!!!!!
One Punch Man,"Fuck yes please right there, you got it."
One Punch Man,ONE PUUUUNCH
One Punch Man,Is season 2 bad? I’ve only seen 1
One Punch Man,"S3 is going to be crazy. After reading some of the chapters, shit is bonkers."
One Punch Man,Glad there’s something to look forward to in terms of continuing anime since the Dragon Ball series will never return…
One Punch Man,"Mappla or Ufortable?

Am I hoping too much?"
One Punch Man,Kick puncher is a better series
One Punch Man,Hoping Mappa or UFO-table picks it up for animation
One Punch Man,yassss
One Punch Man,Let’s goooooooooo
One Punch Man,Season to was ehhhh I hope 3 is worth it
One Punch Man,Finally 🙄
One Punch Man,Amazing news. I can't wait.
One Punch Man,Finally
One Punch Man,better late than never i guess.
One Punch Man,"Yes, this is great news!"
One Punch Man,What studio is making it will make it rise or fall to greatness
One Punch Man,What if trigger did season 3 😯
One Punch Man,"Can someone translate them squiggly lines for us english-readin' folks, please??"
One Punch Man,"Jeez, it’s about damn time."
One Punch Man,Ooooooooh shit
One Punch Man,"Yes, finally Reddit gives me something non political!"
One Punch Man,Mate can they draw faster
One Punch Man,Only thing left is for me to wait for the Dub like the filthy casual I am ☺️
One Punch Man,"I get why they have, but I wish they wouldn’t."
One Punch Man,"Spoiler alert, he will one-punch every enemy during the entire season."
One Punch Man,Hero!!
One Punch Man," ***Guitar riff intensifies***

LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOOOO!!!!"
One Punch Man,"season 3? i'm confused, is this a reboot or something? hasn't one punch been for ages?"
One Punch Man,FINALLY 🥳🥳🥳
One Punch Man,"> J.C. Staff (who animated S2) is unlikely to return.

Thank fuck"
One Punch Man,So 2-3 years to release it?
One Punch Man,Good.  They fucking ruined a ton of a shit.
One Punch Man,Good. Please get the season 1 animators back.
One Punch Man,Who said that?
One Punch Man,Fuck them
One Punch Man,This is the first time I would say an animals animation quality was so low that it was unwatchable. I could only stomach Watching season 2 until episode 2 and quit. Season 1 set the bar so high for animation quality.
One Punch Man,I declare season 3!
One Punch Man,"Fair warning, even if they do, a lot of people who worked on season 1 were freelancers so the animation could still be below the quality of season 1"
One Punch Man,Let us all pray.
One Punch Man,"Mappa or Ufotable, for me."
One Punch Man,"Let Madhouse's A team do season 3  along with a decent budget and no major time constraints.

One Punch Man,Madhouse has fallen off pretty hard I think. To be honest I think Mappa would be good but they have so many projects going on as is.
One Punch Man,Only 2-8 madhouse employees worked on OPM season 1. The rest of it was freelancers
One Punch Man,Oh I’m an idiot haha. I knew the same studio did one punch man and mob psycho. Didn’t realise mob psycho’s author also wrote one punch
One Punch Man,"Saitama is the least interesting character on the show. It's a better show if you pretend he doesn't exist, except you can only do that for so long because he's always inevitably the only solution to the problem at hand."
One Punch Man,i haven't heard about mob spycho but now i have the impression it's as bad as OPM.
One Punch Man,"The arc that S3 is adapting just finished in the manga, which is probably the main reason it’s taken so long."
One Punch Man,This announcement + Overlord Season 4 has been a blessing for me.
One Punch Man,I'm sure someone who is a huge fan could put this better but I see OPM as a weirdly self aware satire on some of the superhero genre anime out there. Main character is super funny. Not really tons of exposition which is nice for an anime. Highly recommend it
One Punch Man,"In terms of those typical anime tropes, you're gonna like OPM since it makes fun of those tropes

Plus, it's just a really solid and funny show"
One Punch Man,"I can’t stand most Anime anymore, but really enjoyed it.  Probably because it’s poking fun at most of the elements that annoy me most about anime and superhero storytelling.

It falls into the same space for anime as ‘Galaxy Quest’ or ‘The Orville’ does for Trek-style SF - both a parody of, and an excellent example of, the genre."
One Punch Man,Probably not.  I think it's hysterical but if you don't get all the things it references it might not do much for you.
One Punch Man,"How far did you get into FMA:Brotherhood BTW?

If you liked the concept but but just couldn’t get into because it felt rushed in the early episodes that’s because it is and you might want to check out the first FMA first. Brotherhood compresses the first 20-something episodes of the original into like the 12 or so just to recap the beginning of the story to get to new part. I do understand why they did that but I feel if you start with the abridged version it’s not as engaging."
One Punch Man,"It’s far less grim dark than AoT, I like both but they’re very different. 

OPM is like a meta-parody of a lot of anime tropes. But with a pretty good underlying story and some cool characters underneath, but a lot of humour."
One Punch Man,"Season 1 is brilliant. It helps that its a parody.  And well worth the watch.

S2 is a dip 9n quality. Still good, but 4nds in an odd spot, and might not be worth it for non-anime fans. 

But S1? Watch S1

(I'm similar to yourself. Not a huge anime fan myself, and started tuning out in S2, but binged S1, cos so damn good)"
One Punch Man,You should watch Death Note.
One Punch Man,"its just another form of media. there are good ones and bad ones. also good ones you wont like, and maybe bad ones you will. its not different then tv shows. if you have a genre you like with tvshows, you will prolly like the good animes in that genre too."
One Punch Man,"I would watch Mob Psycho, its by the same author. Its funny, sweet and has some top action when it does have some."
One Punch Man,it sucks
One Punch Man,"My intro to Anime went One Punch, then Death Note. I've watched a bit more off and on. I'm not sold on anime, but I'm open to it now."
One Punch Man,It's standard seinen anime in conception that has some humor. Visually it can look pretty good.
One Punch Man,Watch/read berserk
One Punch Man,"Yes, absolutely. There isn't much to get invested in so the huge quality drop of the second season doesn't matter much. It's comedy and satire with inspired animation carrying the action. Just don't come in expecting some great story to unfold like AOT or FMA. Watch it for the hype and art. It's more enjoyable than both those shows imo."
One Punch Man,Try more serious anime like Monster or Inuyashiki.
One Punch Man,"Brotherhood is IMO one of the best ever made,  I however did watch the previous Anime before watching brotherhood, and the previous anime left you feeling empty and imcomplete at the end, brotherhood fills that void. Maybe that's why I liked to so much. 

AOT is never ending omg, i read the magna because i can't wait another 5 years for the anime to finish.

&#x200B;

One Punch Man - I'm excited for, I hope they do a decent job and don't just stop after he kills orochi."
One Punch Man,"OPM is great and doesn't have most of the tropes thay annoy me in a lot of anime.

If you like Castlevania, check out DOTA Dragon's Blood and Blood of Zeus on Netflix."
One Punch Man,AOT and one punch man are my top two - maybe hunterxhunter as well
One Punch Man,"This is the show that completely changed my mind on the medium and brought me out of my ""all anime is trash"" phase back in high 

The series is hilarious and season 1 is a platinum standard for animation quality in general. It's one of the best ""starter"" shows for getting into anime because it doesn't have a lot of those tropes you mentioned and when those tropes do appear it's to make fun of them."
One Punch Man,"I have watched both seasons at this point probably 15 times. It is my go to comfort show to have on in the background. It helps if you are familiar with certain anime tropes, but it’s a fun show. I would recommend watching the subtitled version, and I’m someone who always watched English dubs.

The kind of dialog in this show is just better in Japanese and the voice actors especially for Saitama and Genos are incredible."
One Punch Man,One Punch Man is the only anime I’ve watched and I really enjoyed it.
One Punch Man,"it's less satire and more parody. Satire typically leans into harsh even mean spirited takes on genres and tropes. (The Boys is a perfect example of this) Parody is more laugh with the genre and tropes not at them. If you haven't watched a lot of anime, particularly the battle anime genre where it's just all about the fight scenes you won't get as much out of it but it's still a fun comedy to watch."
One Punch Man,"I hope you don't mean stuff like the ""tournament arc trope"". The show has used tons of tropes in season 1 too but with an added twist in form of Saitama. Which he also was in the tournament."
One Punch Man,Garou
One Punch Man,The whole story is mostly about the side characters bud. Saitama has no growth to do so it's always more focused on the struggles of others.
One Punch Man,It will be mostly about the S-Class.
Ergo Proxy,"IMO, *The Last Man on Earth*. I get that its premise was probably unsustainable as a series, but I thought that pilot was way better than the rest of the show.

Outside of that, I found the show was at its best when it was only Will Forte and Kristen Schaal. The group was kinda unlikable, and they tended to draw out the worst in Tandy."
Ergo Proxy,The Walking Dead
Ergo Proxy,"Okay, I'm not going to say it was the *best* one, because it's not by a country mile...but the pilot of *The Golden Girls* represents a missed opportunity.

See, the original plan was that the residents of the house were Dorothy, Rose, Blanche...and their gay cook Coco. Sophia was in the pilot, but she was intended as more of a guest character, who wouldn't be in every episode. But Estelle Getty is hilarious, so Sophia became a fixture and Coco was dropped. Guessing that's why Sophia cooks so much, they probably rewrote a bunch of Coco scenes to be about her, so it became one of her traits.

And I wouldn't have it any other way, Sophia is awesome...but.

The Golden Girls holds up so damn well partly because it wasn't afraid to openly tackle social issues in a hilarious and relatable way. Racism, homophobia, drugs, the AIDS epidemic, homelessness, and that's not even getting into how many plots revolved around the cast being older gals who nonetheless had active sex lives. And they almost had a *gay main character in 1985*.

Would Ellen coming out of the closet, or Will and Grace, have been such big deals if a show had done it a full decade earlier? Of course the sad truth is that TGG probably wouldn't have lasted as long as it did and become such a superclassic if they had. The network probably expected angry letters and editorials, and got cold feet. At least we got Sophia out of it.

Still, the brass balls on that show for making the attempt."
Ergo Proxy,The night of is a perfect pilot
Ergo Proxy,"Westworld. Not that I didn't enjoy the rest of the show, but it had one of the strongest pilot episodes I've ever seen."
Ergo Proxy,"The Night Of. The pilot is of the most nerve-wracking things I've ever watched. The rest of the show is also very well-made but it becomes more of a sluggish courtroom drama, and the pace sags a bit.

The Outsider (also a Richard Price show) had one of the best openings I'd seen, and then immediately fizzled out into empty nonsense."
Ergo Proxy,Suits. Tragic downfall next.
Ergo Proxy,"Out of the shows I really love I can't think of any where the pilot is far and away, inarguably the best episode. But some shows I love where the pilot is definitely a contender for the best episode...

Pushing Daisies  
Deadwood  
Twin Peaks  
Boardwalk Empire  
Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip  
The Newsroom  
Luck  
American Gods  
Dirty Sexy Money  
Battlestar Galactica  
Freaks and Geeks  
Luther"
Ergo Proxy,"The Night of, if it counts"
Ergo Proxy,The Newsroom is an example
Ergo Proxy,this is us
Ergo Proxy,"Heat vision and Jack. But the pilot was the only episode, so kinda cheating."
Ergo Proxy,Korgoth of Barbaria
Ergo Proxy,"""Smash"". I'm guessing most people forgot that it exists, or that the pilot was kind of a huge hit. But after... Oof... Some great songs though!"
Ergo Proxy,"Tokyo Vice, pilot directed by Michael Mann. 

Boardwalk Empire, pilot directed by Martin Scorsese."
Ergo Proxy,By default: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_television_series_canceled_after_one_episode
Ergo Proxy,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix. The opening double-bill was such great Halloween TV but it nose dived fast.
Ergo Proxy,invasion. rest is shit.
Ergo Proxy,Mr. Robot. Definitely one of the best episodes of the whole show
Ergo Proxy,Only one season but Lovecraft Country
Ergo Proxy,Yellowjackets.
Ergo Proxy,"Suits, definitely - the pilot was funny and inventive, then the show descended into soap opera and eventually became unwatchable."
Ergo Proxy,Glee.
Ergo Proxy,Pushing Daisies
Ergo Proxy,"Boomtown
Titus

If you haven’t heard of them, it’s because of the steep drop offs by episode two, but both of their pilots are damn good."
Ergo Proxy,"Not just the pilot but the second episode as well, HBO's The Outsider  - the first two pilot episodes from Jason Bateman was some of the strongest and most intriguing TV I've ever seen."
Ergo Proxy,Last man on earth
Ergo Proxy,Westworld.
Ergo Proxy,Deadwood has an incredible pilot episode
Ergo Proxy,"I don't know if it's the best one, but Futurama has one of the strongest pilots of all time, and it has a lot of callbacks to it through the series, it's the keystone to the entire thing."
Ergo Proxy,*Arrested Development* potentially has the argument. Some of the show’s most iconic moments are in the pilot.
Ergo Proxy,Californication
Ergo Proxy,"For something recent, there's ""The Old Man"".

Seemed to be a cool spy thriller.  Ended up being boring as fook filled with uninteresting and unlikable characters who talk as unnatural and pretentious as possible."
Ergo Proxy,I think the pilot of Star Trek (The Cage) might have been the best episode.
Ergo Proxy,The pilot of Lost was amazing then it went downhill.
Ergo Proxy,"Strange New Worlds

That first episode was everything that I wanted from a new Star Trek show. It had a compelling story line, new planet to visit, new aliens, first contact, the prime directive (general order number one) and a moral dilemma and no outright right or wrong answer. 

The rest of the show were just bottle episodes, they were good but they were not really any better than most classic trek filler episodes."
Ergo Proxy,Battlestar Galactica’s first episode is a masterful sci fi movie. It’s all downhill from there.
Ergo Proxy,The Patient
Ergo Proxy,Ergo Proxy
Ergo Proxy,"Attack on Titan has one of the most captivating pilot episodes I’ve ever seen, got me and my wife hooked immediately."
Ergo Proxy,Last Man On Earth - it goes downhill from there
Ergo Proxy,**The Man in the High Castle** has to be a contender.
Ergo Proxy,Oasis. The pilot is the only one.
Ergo Proxy,"Not that it was good, or the rest of the series, but Apple TV Plus Invasion had an intriguing pilot and the biggest bait and switch of all time with Sam Neil as the main character."
Ergo Proxy,"Debris, it totally fell apart after the pilot."
Ergo Proxy,House of the Dragon
Ergo Proxy,"The Simpsons

I genuinely love the first episode more than any other, as incredible as many others are."
Ergo Proxy,"The Last Man on Earth s1e1 was titled “Alive in Tucson”.

They should have swapped the episode and show name. It would have tempered expectations. I think many people were upset that he was the last man on earth for all of 20 minutes, but it went on for multiple seasons."
Ergo Proxy,"I agree, especially the first part of the pilot where it is 100% him on is own was some of the best tv I’ve ever seen and as soon as other characters came in it lost its spark a bit"
Ergo Proxy,"I've tried to watch that whole series on a couple of occasions and just... I just can't. Tandy never really learns any lessons and continues to be an obnoxious douche, dragging the rest of the crew down with him, and then we're left with a whole bunch of unlikable people. 

Also as the series progresses it starts sacrificing comedy for maudlin, and that snowball never stops growing."
Ergo Proxy,"btw it always kept me guessing why in the world the show is called so, when he's clearly NOT the last one"
Ergo Proxy,"Totally agree.  The pilot had a lot more heart and emotion to it.  By episode 2 it was just another comedy show with a lot of low hanging fruit humor.  I did like the show over all, and watched it all.  It was fun/funny, but episode 1 was something else entirely."
Ergo Proxy,"Totally agree. I think I watched through Season 4 before I just wasn't feeling compelled to continue anymore. I was blown away by the pilot episode, but nothing else after that came close for me. Just the mood and storytelling of that pilot was so good, and it never really recaptured that same feeling afterwards."
Ergo Proxy,"Nah, I'm three seasons in and I think Pretty Much Dead Already and Better Angels are the best I've seen so far."
Ergo Proxy,"I'm not a fan of Darabont's take of the TWD (actually not a fan of TWD: The Series at all), but I see what you mean"
Ergo Proxy,"I watched the pilot episode recently and was pretty underwhelmed by Coco. He seemed more like a foil for other characters to bounce off of than a character in his own right. Maybe they could have found his voice as the show went on, but with Sophia it was immediate. 

It was rare but there were gay main characters on shows like Dynasty and Soap (although there was plenty of baggage with how they were written). Matt Baume on YouTube has some great videos about early examples like that."
Ergo Proxy,"Miami you're cuter than, an interuterant"
Ergo Proxy,"ok, this is some heavy stuff right here, never watched GG but fully appreciate queen Betty White. would've been interesting if they chose this creative direction"
Ergo Proxy,I would say Westworld had the best 1st season.
Ergo Proxy,"Funny, I clicked thinking of mentioning the same thing but hesitated because it doesnt necessarily stand out far above other episodes. I also rate it as the best pilot episode of all time, we might be pilotbros."
Ergo Proxy,"> The Outsider

The first two episodes of that show are excellent, it falls off a cliff starting in the third."
Ergo Proxy,"Didn't watch The Night Of, but strongly disagree on the Outsider. It's not the show fault, that everything went off the rails - the book was written that way and the show made it MUCH better. Though, I really liked it and Cynthia Erivo was amazing as Holly (but I still love Mr Mercedes' Holly)"
Ergo Proxy,"Their interaction when Mike comes in with his new suit always kills me. 

""I thought I told you to get some better suits"" 

""I spent $500"" 

""For how many suits?""

""5"""
Ergo Proxy,Absolutely. The pilot is such a fun and ridiculous premise. The rest of the show is just chasing the dragon.
Ergo Proxy,Lost
Ergo Proxy,"> Battlestar Galactica

The first 2 episodes are spectacular, but for good reason, it was a 2-part miniseries that was effectively a 3 hour movie rather than a normal season of TV. 'Episode 3' didn't air until nearly a year after 'episode 2'."
Ergo Proxy,"Dirty Sexy Money, wow I never thought I'd think about that show ever again. Definitely had a strong start, only to devolve into typical soap opera drama."
Ergo Proxy,"Ooofff, Luck. Haven't heard this title in a while."
Ergo Proxy,I know Studio 60 isn't super popular here on Reddit but I really enjoyed it. Sad it never got a second season.
Ergo Proxy,"Battlestar Galactica is a good call. 

And while I don't think the pilot of Twin Peaks is the best episode, I definitely prefer its tone to the warmer, goofier ""house style"" that dominates most of the rest of the original series. When I think about why I love Twin Peaks, at least 80% of it is the Lynch-directed episodes, Fire Walk With Me, and the strongest parts of The Return."
Ergo Proxy,">Boardwalk Empire

This is definitely one, bc it’s the difference btwn Martin Scorsese directing and…not Martin Scorsese directing.

I find it interesting that not many people know Scorsese won an Emmy for this. Most people seem to assume he’s a film “purist”, but he also directed the pilot of *Vinyl*."
Ergo Proxy,"I thought the opening scene of the pilot was legendary and the rest of the episode was a bit clunky. There were some really great episodes of the show in seasons 2 and 3, especially the whole ""Operation Genoa"" controversy with Hamish Linklater's character. The series finale was also very sweet."
Ergo Proxy,Counterpoint: Bin laden episode of newsroom where Will is broadcasting ripped out of his fucking mind.
Ergo Proxy,"Congratulations, you've missed the point"
Ergo Proxy,Was looking for this. I love the show as a whole but the pilot just captured this wonderful magical feeling that it never quite recaptured
Ergo Proxy,"Wow, someone mentioning Boomtown!  My wife and I loved that show.

I don't remember the pilot, but I would put the best episode as the one with the frat house.  The 'twist' at the end was so great, and completely unexpected."
Ergo Proxy,The Titus pilot is literally his stand up show.
Ergo Proxy,Lost had many amazing episodes that were better than the pilot.
Ergo Proxy,[deleted]
Ergo Proxy,Ignoring some great episodes in seasons 2-4? The pilot was among the strongest episodes though
Ergo Proxy,"I’d have to disagree there. The first episode was a great first ep, but the whole season was strong, and the finale was amazing."
Ergo Proxy,"I actually liked the Season 2 premiere better than the pilot. But those two episodes are the best of the series, IMO."
Ergo Proxy,Some enchanted evening or the Christmas episode?
Ergo Proxy,"Wasn't it 5 years in show, though?"
Ergo Proxy,"I totally disagree.  Tandy is the only one that handles the situation in a reasonably healthy manner.  He actually goes through the stages of grief throughout the show while the rest of the group tend to get stuck for along periods of time in different stages.  Tandy is realistic about the situation while everyone else is not.  It is, of course, an inversion of most shows where the  crazy-obnoxious character is the least connected to reality, while on the Last Man on Earth that character IS the most connected."
Ergo Proxy,"Clear is great too (in season 3, not sure if you've gotten to that yet)"
Ergo Proxy,You best quit after season 4.
Ergo Proxy,Never said it doesn't have some good episodes after that but none of those come close to the cinematic quality of the pilot imo. I do agree with u/Fu-Man-Chewbacca however. Season 5 is really when the show starts to stink it up.
Ergo Proxy,Best first season of any show? I'd say True Detective is up there.
Ergo Proxy,"That's for sure, by a large margin too. After that it's just downhill although season 4 seems to be better received than the third?"
Ergo Proxy,That’s because Emmy-winner (Ozark) Jason Bateman directed the first two episodes but didn’t want to do the whole thing.
Ergo Proxy,Yup.
Ergo Proxy,"Lost rides that high through Season 1 and most of Season 2 though. You can definitely argue for it but I thought there were some banger episodes that were even better because of my investment. 


The episode when they find out there's an extra person in the group from the Others or when they open the hatch were amazing."
Ergo Proxy,"I really loved pretty much all of Dirty Sexy Money. I usually rewatch the whole thing once every couple of years. I think it started to get into trouble just a bit before it ultimately ended, but I've always felt like, had the show kept going, it was something it could have easily pulled out of. I think a lot is made of that dip by people who watched the show because it didn't get renewed, but if it had kept going, I really believe that it probably would be a barely remembered second season dip in quality.

So infuriated though that they ended on such a massive cliffhanger. Oh my fucking god."
Ergo Proxy,"I thought it was such an interesting and intriguing show. I get why it was canceled, but still bummed that it was. And even more bummed that it's probably going to be the last show we ever get out of David Milch's mind. That's kind of a heartbreaking thing.

Does anyone else remember the talk from years and years ago (I think around the time that Luck was on) that he was going to be doing a bunch of Faulkner adaptations for HBO? That never coming to pass is one of the most significant disappointments of my life, made all the worse by the abominations that were James Franco's adaptations of As I Lay Dying and The Sound and the Fury."
Ergo Proxy,"I feel like Studio 60 isn't popular anywhere. I've always really loved it. And I do think most people do consider the pilot to be the best episode. I think it's in contention, but I really love Long Lead Story and The Christmas Show (I think that might be the best Christmas episode of any show). But yeah, I think it's a really good show and the hate it gets is unfair. Yeah, there's some uneven-ness, but I feel like that's mostly the fault of the network than anything, and even then, Sorkin was able to roll with it."
Ergo Proxy,"I have no problem with the tone of most of the series, but I do tend to find that when I think of ""best episodes"", they're ones that lean more into the dark weirdness. I think the pilot is definitely in contention for the best episode, but the finale and episode 2/Zen or the Skill to Catch a Killer are also really high up there."
Ergo Proxy,I would probably say that the pilot is far and away its best episode were it not for To the Lost.
Ergo Proxy,"I’ll hunt down my DVDs and find the frat house episode. That pilot, though, could have been released as a movie. So good."
Ergo Proxy,The Constant is an easy example

Making bad jokes that punch down at certain groups doesn't automatically qualify something as funny just because it's edgy or dark.

Gervais' roasts at the globe's were brilliant because he was punching up: actors and producers are some of the most globally privileged people in the world and poking fun at their egos, their self importance and their association with various ne'er-do-wells...

Bill burr does it well because his comedy is rarely targeted at those groups and rather it targets his own stupidity and ignorance or the privileged people proclaiming to be about the defence of minority groups. He is punching up, while talking about controversial topics relating to minority or underprivileged groups.

"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","It's impossible to live life without offending anyone. So really what must be asked is ""Whom should I offend?"" If you're trolling Nazis, you're cool. If you're trolling trans people, blow your head off or read a book."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","""I'm gonna be a hack now everyone are you excited?"""
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Won't be hard
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",🙄🙄🙄
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",With a bit of luck the show will get cancelled because no one wants to go.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","Why wait?  One tweet is enough for most people.

I mean it couldn't possibly be a PR stunt to sell his show?"
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","Didn’t jimmy carr just do this ? 
As many have pointed out it should be no problem - just tackle a controversial subject that you have no background in without tact or any real point of view."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",ooooohhh that will be spicy...
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Nothing more cringe than the most popular comedians in the world pretending that they’re getting ”cancelled” while getting richer and richer lmao
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Just say what Whoopi Goldberg said but with more edginess
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",so edgy wow
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","Meh...ultra-rich millionaire making fun of other rich millionaires. Oh, no no, he's ""like us"", yes?

He's funny, but come on. The hypocrisy is palpable."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",What an overgrown 13yo looks like
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",So he is basically being an edgelord? What a fucking loser lol

"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",How utterly tedious.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",go full kramer
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",What a sad man
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Getting cancelled doesn’t even really happen like it used to
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",But will he attempt to be funny?
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Very Beautiful Crochet Pattern \* https://youtu.be/Oa\_pxH8MFEU \*
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn"," From what I've seen, the only way to actually get cancelled is to be a pedo. I don't think he's that committed."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","He's not going to get cancelled, I think a lot of comedians are seeing ""woke"" culture as a way more militant movement than it is, and think that everyone is after them. It's easy to think that with twitter, where ricky is pretty active, but his and many other comedian's jokes dance around the line and they're clever about how they use language. Most comedians aren't going to get actually dragged unless they do something overtly nasty."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",I hope he succeeds in getting canceled. He’s just a bitchy arrogant old man.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Sooooooo edgy
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",I've loved Ricky ever since the original Office days but he's slowly becoming so  obsessed with trying to combat cancel culture he's starting to forget he's supposed to be funny. I'll pass.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","OoOo what a badass! An obscenely wealthy Hollywood elite that pretends he isn’t! Oh, Ricky, what WILL you say next??? I cant! 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 fuckthisloser"
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",This is what happens when you tell rich old white men they’re funny.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",It’s a pretty smart preemptive strike. Now he can take his act up several notches and not get canceled. He basically just cancel-proofed himself by announcing that he’s trying to get canceled.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","So he wants money and is pandering to ignorant reactionaries again.                       
If I could, I would do the same."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Big “pick me” energy
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",I truly can’t think of anyone in Hollywood that I hate more than him.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Just jerk off infront of your coworkers a few times
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",There’s nothing Ricky Gervais loves more than pretending he’s been cancelled. Just desperately begging the libs to be triggered by his content
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Totally new concept. Completely cutting edge. Fun time in comedy! Definitely not boring and reductive.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","If it’s the one I saw him do recently at the forum in Kentish Town then it’s going to fucking annoy all the right people.

It was hilarious."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","I don’t get this: if the standard complaint about canceling is that the bar for saying something before uproar is too low (ie. ‘you can’t say anything anymore without getting canceled’), then how is this a noteworthy thing?  Why make a press statement?  Why make a big deal about it?"
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","Oh that shouldn’t be too hard, just say anything"
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Best way to make millions of dollars? Get cancelled so all the freedom warriors think throwing money at you is an act of defiance.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","I'm not really a fan of Ricky Gervais, but that's admirable.  Offending soft people is what the world needs right now."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","I don’t like Ricky Gervais, there’s a mean-spiritedness to him that I don’t enjoy.  I’ve enjoyed some of his acting roles.  But you know, I just avoid watching him rather than call for cancellation.  Which I think is how a mature person should handle it.  

But this?  Pure petulance.  Very cringe."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Ohh boy....
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",I believe this is what they call baiting the hook. At this point its pretty clear he will attempt to claim that he was cancelled for whatever it is he ends up saying regardless of what happens to him for it.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","ITT: People who read the clickbait headline, but not the article and the full quote. As usual..."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",[deleted]
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","If you legitimately want to get cancelled just say the hard R while sexually assaulting a cute animal on stage while simultaneously committing tax fraud.

It’s really not that hard to actually get cancelled."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",Good! I hope he’s successful! Best of luck to him.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",I fucking love him. His show after life was pretty good
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","Nobody noticed how these 'iM BeIng CAnCeLleD' comedians are making mad bank? 

Like, you go on a stage, you say some stupid shit, there's some tweets about how you were being a cockhead and bingo. Now you can just do a new routine on Netflix about how you're a victim talking about being cancelled while slack-jawed morons throw money at you because you're feeding into the narrative their lifestyle is under attack.

Congratulations, you made the world worse.

Also, the English prick is painfully unfunny."
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",i guarantee he's not going to try and i guarantee he wont get canceled. he doesnt have the balls to do what is required to be actually canceled lmao
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn",What a fucking bellend.
"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn","Doesnt trying kind of weaken the point you're making if not done correctly? Like the Milo guy that was used to tour and try to ""trigger"" people. Our expectation in society is that you try *not* to be a dick. You're not proving some flaw in society by being a dick and pointing at people's reaction... you're just being a dick."
Japanese Style Originator,"I find it awesome and very interesting for anyone into japanese culture. A rare insight
However it’s a bit weird yes"
Japanese Style Originator,"Ugh... I've been watching it. It is interesting but I have to take everything with a grain of salt. I question some of their ""facts"". Such as why a screen mesh for cooking cost as much as it does. They say it's because each of mesh is welded and therefore very durable. Then they show a close up of the mesh. It's not welded mesh. It's the kind of mesh that gets created when you take a sheet of metal, put thousands of little slits in it and then stretch it. Each of the slits opens up a little.
Still it's good for some exposure to interesting stuff."
Japanese Style Originator,"Yeah it has had some very weird editing or cuts to it. I defies logic. Just jump to around episode 18 or so and enjoy the cute Shiba-Inu named Mamesuke. He's adorable. 

Also I dunno if I would class it as a ""documentary"" really. It's a 'variety' show in Japan. I guess Netflix Japan was able to buy it on the cheap from the network? It has some interesting stuff but it's got a bit of random game show built in. I watched a few episodes (or half episodes because they're so chopped up) but probably wont watch the rest. "
Japanese Style Originator,"Im ressurectin this.

Im from Brazil and this show appeard on netflix here not long ago. As Im a japanese culture fan I decided to give it a shot. And its pretty good. The thing is there are a lot of weird stuff regarding episodes and cuts. I tried to find it out on the web but theres very little informarion about. And who are these people? I mean, they do not seem to be very famous as I could discover.

I dont know... just very intrigued about this stuff."
Japanese Style Originator,"I really like it, too... kind of bizarre and calming at the same time.  Also nice to have on in the background while you're cleaning house."
Japanese Style Originator,I enjoy the fact that the nephews are continuing the Iron chef line
Japanese Style Originator,"Haven't had the chance to watch the new Mexico version,  but was pretty impressed by Netflix latest season of Iron Chef America"
Japanese Style Originator,For lovers of the original Japanese there's an entire [Pluto.tv](https://Pluto.tv) channel of it. It's amazing.
Japanese Style Originator,Ive liked Netflixs new iron chef shows so far.
Japanese Style Originator,"I liked it very much. Although I was not happy with the last competition( won’t spoil it), but the vegan and insect challenge was legit."
Japanese Style Originator,My bf and I binged the whole season in record time. I can't stop thinking and talking about it. Superb. 10 stars.
Japanese Style Originator,Thank you!
Japanese Style Originator,Where can I watch this?
Japanese Style Originator,I hope we get a S2.
Japanese Style Originator,Oh that's next for me to watch :)
Japanese Style Originator,">  the vegan and insect challenge was legit.

Thank you for letting me know this is easy to skip."
Japanese Style Originator,Netflix
Japanese Style Originator,"What's wrong with vegan food, lol."
Japanese Style Originator,"I don’t blame you, specially if you didn’t grow up eating some of this stuff, I did so I liked the episode very much."
Japanese Style Originator,"I lived in Mexico briefly and have no problem with the cuisine, but if they are focusing on bullshit like that instead of actual traditional Mexican cuisine and ingredients it isn't my style.

I prefer to not sit through obvious cultural appropriation."
Japanese Style Originator,">	I lived in Mexico briefly and have no problem with the cuisine,


I grew up down there and eating any ant-eggs and those little cactus grubs have been a staple in the regional diet since pre-colonization times.


>	I prefer to not sit through obvious cultural appropriation.

It’s cooking by Mexican chefs for a Mexican audience you absolute woke-wanker."
Japanese Style Originator,The techniques and regional culinary traditions used here are very much Mexican. Watch an episode with an open mind.
Japanese Style Originator,"No shit, and some people in America eat mac + cheese with american cheese all the time.

Does that mean an American cooking competition should choose crappy pasta and american cheese as 'special ingredients'?

No, because much richer and more appealing foods represent the country better, just like Mexico.

Why are we watching them cook with crap simply because the producers want to push that lifestyle?  It is a cooking show, not politics."
Japanese Style Originator,"With all due respect, you have absolutely no idea what you are writing about.

Watch the show, at least one episode, then come back and write your manifesto. You're way off."
Japanese Style Originator,"Yeah I only lived in Mexico and ate across the country.

So amusing to watch people who have no international culinary experience talk down because I actually know good Mexican ingredients.

Keep eating your crickets while I enjoy some huitlacoche."
Japanese Style Originator,Escamoles >>> huitlacoche nuff said.
Japanese Style Originator,"Like I said, watch the show. You are railing against a thing that the show is not."
Japanese Style Originator,">The dishes were like ""I put truffles on chicken"" ""Salmon with an egg on it"". Japanese version they are literally inventing new dishes and techniques right before your eyes.

A lot of it was honestly ""I put truffles on chicken"", but it was Japanese. They use truffle and foi gras *a lot*"
Japanese Style Originator,[deleted]
Japanese Style Originator,"That episode is in the opening credits. You see the Iron Chef pulling an octopus out of the tank and it's holding on for dear life. Now that we know more about them, that poor thing probably really was trying to fight for its life. Very intelligent and aware animals."
Japanese Style Originator,"My family watched it when I was a kid, I’m pretty sure I saw the invention of stained glass sushi the night it premiered."
Japanese Style Originator,This is how I feel about rewatching G4’s OG version of Ninja Warrior.
Japanese Style Originator,Chairman Kaga was the man!
Japanese Style Originator,I saw the original on Food Network when I was younger and caught some episodes on Youtube as well (I don't have Pluto TV in my country). It did not disappoint.
Japanese Style Originator,"lol, the music they inserted to cover up the Backdraft soundtrack on Pluto TV sounds like a PS1 JRPG."
Japanese Style Originator,Two words: Natto episode.
Japanese Style Originator,*bites into bell pepper* Allez Cuisine!
Japanese Style Originator,Old school Iron Chef was sweet.
Japanese Style Originator,Iron Chef was really entertaining and enjoyable! They had so many chefs and challenges. The US version was just...bland :\
Japanese Style Originator,"Woah, awesome. Loved the original -- with all due respect to Alton Brown, they never really hit the right notes of the original."
Japanese Style Originator,"It's food culture that is different now.  The trends now feel so homogenized.

Back a few years, I was asked to judge a drink competition.  I actually passed it to one of my subordinates because I think I wouldn't be a good judge.  I wanted to understand the judging criteria, and I think I would judge it as someone who enjoys alcohol vs someone who wants to see their work in a magazine.

I saw what became of the event and it was exactly as I imagined.  They gave the win to someone that did an obnoxious smoked beverage under a glass with an excessive amount of sugar and technique.  It would never be something that I wanted to enjoy, but it would be something to show in a picture.  The second place guy had what seemed to be a good cocktail.

The American version is for a different audience with a different goal.  It's just another game show.

But just so you know - they have 3 weeks to go over their dishes with 3 options for secret ingredients.  They have worked on these dishes, but don't know which secret ingredient will be chosen."
Japanese Style Originator,"May have already been said, but it's actually from Filmrise, also a free app that let's you go through all the episodes rather than livestream. 

I know PlutoTV has OnDemand too, but it's not as good as their source imo."
Japanese Style Originator,"I remember the episode where the ingredient was octopus, and they were all horrified by it.

The judges were flat out admitting that they were only tasting it because they *had* to."
Japanese Style Originator,Is there anyway to know when PlutoTV gets new shows/channels? This is the third or fourth time now a show has been added that I'd love to watch and I've had no idea it was there.
Japanese Style Originator,Agreed. The dishes they came up with for the special ingredient were amazing and totally unique. It would have been an honour to be a guest judge and sample those dishes from both chefs.
Japanese Style Originator,Well when Food Network decided to shove the notion Bobby Flay is an elite chef down our throat. It was always garbage.
Japanese Style Originator,"For a minute I thought that the one dubbed with Alton Brown narrating was the english version and there was a different Japanese one, totally forgot about the trainwreck one hosted by the generic asian villian."
Japanese Style Originator,"Well I can't speak to the creativity of the dishes, but it was certainly more entertaining due to all the theatrics!"
Japanese Style Originator,"If I could give you a hug right now, I would! I loved this show growing up and I had no idea it was on Pluto!"
Japanese Style Originator,[deleted]
Japanese Style Originator,"Sorry to piggy back off your post but does anyone know where I can stream the original Kitchen Nightmares based in the UK? 

I always thought it was so much better than the American version but they have the same exact name. Unfortunately, everytime I search for episodes the US version comes up :("
Japanese Style Originator,"I honestly have never heard of Pluto tv. So, what... bigger branch does it fall under? And is it just some regional thing?"
Japanese Style Originator,"You have made me so happy, thank you!!"
Japanese Style Originator,I like to switch between Iron Chef and MXC on Pluto
Japanese Style Originator,I really like Pluto TV but it needs more of the shows it plays on demand.
Japanese Style Originator,"Bang a gong, it is on."
Japanese Style Originator,"Thanks for posting this :)

My wife and I used to watch this every night way back when, and since I saw this post I’ve been binging it while recovering from surgery. So much fun!"
Japanese Style Originator,"I, too, have been binging for days!  I have been looking off and on for it to stream for literally years.  Just found it last week, and it made me so happy!!!  What is it that make us love it so much?!  I never cared for the American version."
Japanese Style Originator,does anyone have the direct link to iron chef on pluto tv? i went to the website but found nothing.
Japanese Style Originator,"I've been binging for days they didn't use it nearly as much as the American version and it's fine dining. They didn't just use truffles, it was incorporated into their dish as an actual part of it not just hey I put truffles on this it's now fine dining! It was a dish made by a master with or without the truffles. Foi gras was used as well but I've only seen it a handful of times and that includes the foi gras battle.

I'm not damning the use of these items. It's the way they were used that I have a problem with. If just seemed like the American Iron Chefs were just putting that stuff on normal dishes to make it seem like the dish was greater than it actual was.

I may be a bit biased but I think there's some validity to that."
Japanese Style Originator,"It looks like the challenger has a combination of abalone and crab wrapped in fat.

Oh wow! I imagine he's going to fry this in a pan? 

I would imagine so... Ope! Yep! There it goes. The abalone and crab going into the hot pan. 

It looks so delicious! *laughs* I can smell from here!"
Japanese Style Originator,Fukui San says Take It!!
Japanese Style Originator,"Octopus is one of the only things I've stopped eating for humanitarian reasons. If there's octopus in a mixed combo or something, I'll go ahead and eat it, but I'm not ordering it again."
Japanese Style Originator,I'm still amazed by that.
Japanese Style Originator,#*SASUKE*
Japanese Style Originator,"In the British and Australian version of Ninja Warrior it's hilarious because the final episode is them doing the actual original format of Ninja Warrior with the finalists, so you end up with guys winning 100K for getting halfway through stage 2 and stuff."
Japanese Style Originator,"We don't talk about G4. They ruined TechTV. I will agree with you though. BTW, Battle Strawberry is on right now. Allez! Cuisine!"
Japanese Style Originator,Where can I watch original Ninja Warrior episodes?
Japanese Style Originator,He was also Jean Val Jean in the Japanese production of Les Miserables! For one pf the anniversary specials they got the most famous Jean Val Jean from each country to come in for a big number together. I almost did a spittake when I spotted Kaga.
Japanese Style Originator,"Food Network was where I saw it first as well. Always watched it when it was on. Then they came out with the American version and never aired the Japanese version again. Can't believe how bad the American version is. I mean, okay, I'm not going to beat any of the American Iron Chefs in a battle but, that doesn't mean they aren't basically cooks compared to the Japanese Iron Chefs."
Japanese Style Originator,I miss that especially the ingredients reveal the drama !!!!
Japanese Style Originator,Natto is an acquired taste.  I love it now.
Japanese Style Originator,I actually tried natto once. Once.
Japanese Style Originator,Don't remember that one and don't think I've seen it on here yet. Right now I'm watching Battle Turkey.
Japanese Style Originator,"You forgot

*smiles knowingly, looks toward camera, gives a small chuckle*

I just love how he is in the stadium alone, then he takes the bite of the pepper, the camera pans back and the stadium is now full of hundreds of sous Chefs."
Japanese Style Originator,That was the saddest part. Nothing but respect for Alton Brown that guy doesn't just know cooking he knows the science of it and he taught me how to make the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. Good eats was a great show also. Always loved the humor and skits.
Japanese Style Originator,That is correct. Everyone knows what the secret ingredient will be when they arrive and see their station. They are able to pick what ingredients they want to use for each possible secret ingredient. So once they arrive depending on what layout is ready for them they know beforehand what the challenge will be and can mentally prepare for it.
Japanese Style Originator,"Don't have filmrise will have to check it out but I don't mind the Pluto way. I put the channel on and do what I need to all day while it plays in the background. Sounds odd but I kind of like the commercials, gives me a minute to get up and do something without missing it and it feels like real TV."
Japanese Style Originator,"I never knew FilmRise was free, thank you! I guess because I only saw it on Amazon, I assumed it was a subscription streaming service."
Japanese Style Originator,"The only way I find out is by watching Pluto. I'm sure you can find info somewhere else. I've never seen a schedule though. Thankfully, I watch a lot of Three's Company and Supermarket Sweep that I saw the commercial for the Iron Chef Channel."
Japanese Style Originator,[cordcuttersnews.com](https://cordcuttersnews.com)  usually let's people know when new channels are added.
Japanese Style Originator,Only way I know of outside watching Pluto is by following them on social media.
Japanese Style Originator,They used the same judges a lot. Could you imagine? Being paid to eat some of the best food ever made? That's why one day I'm going to a 3 star restaurant and dropping three hundo on a 12 course meal. Closest place I know of to me is a place in Chicago. I want that experience.
Japanese Style Originator,"Hang on.  Bobby Flay doesn’t have the pedigree that Ramsey does admittedly, but he was a Michelin star chef.  You can’t achieve that and not be an elite chef."
Japanese Style Originator,"I just read up on him backing down the very next day after accepting to challenge Ramsay. As the story goes, Ramsay walked into Flay's restaurant and told him that he wanted to cut the BS. Just you and me, 60 minutes. Ramsay even offered a 10 minute head start and an extra sous chef. At first Flay accepted then the next day backed out.

Ramsay said something about how he loves when people say he should challenge flay saying something like ""I've forgotten more stuff than Bobby Flay knows.""

I would have loved to see a Ramsay vs Bourdain challenge. To see those two at their best would be a sight to behold."
Japanese Style Originator,That's great! Exactly why I made the post!
Japanese Style Originator,I'm no expert of Japanese culture but I'm pretty sure the exaggerated reactions and emotions are typical fare on game shows.
Japanese Style Originator,It's on pluto tv. You can either tune into the channel or you can binge them all with the on demand option. You can do the same with Iron chef actually.
Japanese Style Originator,"Pluto is Viacom CBS. They have a lot of programming as far as being regional:

Pluto TV can currently be used in Australia, Europe, the UK, and Canada. However, viewers in these countries won't be able to access all the available content, unless they connect with a US IP address."
Japanese Style Originator,I'm happy you're happy! So far it seems this post is doing its job very well.
Japanese Style Originator,I binged out on MXC not that long ago. Guy LeDouche's voice is still in my head.
Japanese Style Originator,"True, they do seem to play the same shows and episodes plus the same movies all the time. That's why I like the fact they do have the on demand feature."
Japanese Style Originator,Huh it has its own dedicated channel but [Here you go](https://pluto.tv/en/live-tv/iron-chef-ptv2)
Japanese Style Originator,"True, sure.  I never really watched the American bastardizations of Japanese competition shows that were actually good"
Japanese Style Originator,Wow these 2 comments really brought it all back to me!
Japanese Style Originator,"You’re 1,000,000% correct"
Japanese Style Originator,TechTV and G4 should never have merged. I’m writing an article about it rn and there’s a lot of mistakes G4 made.
Japanese Style Originator,G4 is back baybeeeee
Japanese Style Originator,It was embarassing how many times the american iron chefs lost in comparison
Japanese Style Originator,"Durian, next! :)"
Tong: Memories,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."
Tong: Memories,Hooch is crazy

Tong: Memories,I thought this was wallstreebets DD for a second lol
Tong: Memories,"Nothing on any of the ""old"" Netflix series has me sad...  Nice write up, though."
Tong: Memories,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
Tong: Memories,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
Tong: Memories,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
Tong: Memories,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
Tong: Memories,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
Tong: Memories,that's a lot of content
Tong: Memories,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
Tong: Memories,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
Tong: Memories,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
Tong: Memories,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
Tong: Memories,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"
Tong: Memories,">Tiana is the first princess to have her own Walt Disney Animation Studios series

Just going to ignore the Little Mermaid and Tangled series apparently."
Tong: Memories,[deleted]
Tong: Memories,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
Tong: Memories,Any specific dates to go with this?
Tong: Memories,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
Tong: Memories,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
Tong: Memories,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
Tong: Memories,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
Tong: Memories,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
Tong: Memories,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
Tong: Memories,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
Tong: Memories,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
Tong: Memories,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
Tong: Memories,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
Tong: Memories,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
Tong: Memories,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
Tong: Memories,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
Tong: Memories,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
Tong: Memories,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
Tong: Memories,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
Tong: Memories,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
Tong: Memories,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."
Tong: Memories,[deleted]
Tong: Memories,"If they don't have Phill Lewis playing the dog using mocap, they dun goofed."
Tong: Memories,*holds up lighter*
Tong: Memories,Thanks man you're awesome
Tong: Memories,[Rogue squadron](https://youtu.be/5bLkTjn6Y_s)
Tong: Memories,Not enough 🚀🚀🚀
Tong: Memories,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
Tong: Memories,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
Tong: Memories,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
Tong: Memories,And Swiss Family Robinson.
Tong: Memories,It’s pretty genius
Tong: Memories,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
Tong: Memories,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
Tong: Memories,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
Tong: Memories,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
Tong: Memories,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
Tong: Memories,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
Tong: Memories,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
Tong: Memories,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
Tong: Memories,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
Tong: Memories,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
Tong: Memories,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
Tong: Memories,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
Tong: Memories,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
Tong: Memories,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
Tong: Memories,That’s pathetic
Tong: Memories,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
Tong: Memories,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
Tong: Memories,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
Tong: Memories,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
Tong: Memories,[deleted]
Tong: Memories,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
Tong: Memories,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
Tong: Memories,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
Tong: Memories,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
Tong: Memories,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
Tong: Memories,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
Tong: Memories,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo. 

&nbsp;

Tong: Memories,[deleted]
Tong: Memories,"It's a Disney property.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
Tong: Memories,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
Tong: Memories,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
Tong: Memories,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
Tong: Memories,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
Tong: Memories,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
Tong: Memories,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
Tong: Memories,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
Tong: Memories,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
Tong: Memories,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
Love is in the Air,"I tried this show. And I like rom coms (loved Dash & Lily). I like trash, crap shows (enjoyed Insaitable), but this one is not only bad, but also the worst offender: Boring. Don’t get the success."
Love is in the Air,There’s a 3rd season of this? Impressed
Love is in the Air,All Netflix shows look the same at this point.
Love is in the Air,I'll watch only if her new love interest is Joe Goldberg.
Love is in the Air,Up until they said Korea I had no idea which systemic religious sex crimes they were going to expose. Keep 'em comin'!
Love is in the Air,"10 years for three rapes, release, and subsequent rape..."
Love is in the Air,Thought this was going to be about the moonies.
Love is in the Air,"I’m not sensitive at all, I eat up horror and documentaries about uncomfortable topics, but this one is very brutally straight forward.

Like, there’s no sleepy drone footage of the protagonists hometown accompanied by slightly tense piano music to slowly set the mood, the first episode is an interview of one of his victims crying and describing being raped.

I think it speaks to how important the producer felt telling the story was and how much built up energy and oppression JMS created over the past few decades."
Love is in the Air,"Aside from the documentary, I’d love to see what Netflix attorneys filed to nullify the injunction. 

Could you imagine the things that were submitted during the discovery period?  That’s a documentary all to itself."
Love is in the Air,There are korean christian cults all over southern california. There are kids who are indoctrinated in these systems even to this day. I wish these churches get exposed for what they do.
Love is in the Air,I grew up in a korean cult. Not a sex cult for the followers but I suspect the higher ups did whatever the fuck they wanted including marrying a 16 year old when the leader was 40.
Love is in the Air,Blows my mind what some people can get others to do for them using religion.
Love is in the Air,"A kpop idol had to release a statement through his company about his family’s involvement so this is bringing a big wave in Korea. And that same cafe that was ran, JMS, is apparently off the map in Naver, Korea’s search engine. Creepy stuff."
Love is in the Air,"OMG!!! I’m actually shaking right now. I went to this church back in 2013 when my brother and sister in law dragged me to go. It was a branch in Tustin, California. They were suuupes wild."
Love is in the Air,"We watched the first two episodes last night.  Way jacked up.  

It’s the same playbook used by pedos throughout the ages.  

One more “man of God” using the scriptures to literally screw children."
Love is in the Air,"I tried to watch it but for some reason they decided to use ""interpreters"" rather than just having it subtitled and it sounds like a bad dub."
Love is in the Air,Man the idea to get an injunction really backfired because now I want to know what they’re trying to hide.
Love is in the Air,Cultist leaders abusing power.  Religion in a nutshell.
Love is in the Air,Is there a particular reason why South Korea has so many weird religious cults?
Love is in the Air,"""I've been involved in a number of cults both as a leader and a follower. You have more fun as a follower but you make more money as a leader."" - Creed Bratton."
Love is in the Air,Korea needs to reject Christianity. They were brutally colonized by missionaries.
Love is in the Air,Started this without even really paying attention to what I was selecting have some noise as I fell asleep. My eyes are closed and then wide open as some of the first shit you hear had me ready to vomit and murder someone at the same time.
Love is in the Air,"Holy betrayal, Batman!"
Love is in the Air,Reverend Moon?
Love is in the Air,"and that is why i dislike religion so much. because the people that are in religions are mostly weak minded people and they are easy prey for the ones in power.

also for any rape victim. i ask you this. would you feel more safe when the rapist is dead, or still alive and knowing he will eventually come out of jail?"
Love is in the Air,"I tried to watch this documentary, but to me they also used the victims to sell their documentary.  The doc used full footage of the victims naked and did not blur out an parts. It just felt like re-taking advantage of women that were brain washed and cult abused. I had to end it."
Love is in the Air,Is this a good documentary? I added it to my list because I've never watched a documentary in another language and I watched so many KDramas.
Love is in the Air,Cool now do the Catholics of America
Love is in the Air,The only thing crazier than Korean Catholicism is American evangelism.
Love is in the Air,Do jehovah's witnesses next
Love is in the Air,Religious people be like: “come to our church so we can molest u”
Love is in the Air,IMHO I can’t wait for all organized religion to die…. The harm it’s caused far outweighs any good.
Love is in the Air,Why are Koreans so prone to cults?? I can kindda see why the Chinese government ban religious cults the likes of falungong from arising.
Love is in the Air,Don't have religion where you idolize the leaders. Having religion could even apply to those who claim to believe in science. The scientific methodology is one where you test to determine if a hypothesis is false or not false. Because it isn't false doesn't make it true. Science is akin to forever chipping away at a slab of marble to determine the sculpture underneath. True science can only determine correlation and not causality. Statements of absolute causality are not statements of science but of religion.
Love is in the Air,Will this involves the moonies?
Love is in the Air,Every single religion has coverups rarely do they self report!
Love is in the Air,All religions are a sex and money scam. Every single one.
Love is in the Air,Anywhere else to watch it? Canceled Netflix due to the new password restrictions
Love is in the Air,"Cool.

Now do Evangelicals in the US.

EDIT: To be clear, I think this is a great documentary and I'm glad they won the right to air it.  I'm saying I'd like to see this trend of exposing gross religious organizations by documentaries funded and platformed by major media companies continue on."
Love is in the Air,Unrelated to the film itself but I wish it had either been titled *In the Name of God* or *A Holy Betrayal*.
Love is in the Air,Man Koreans are not gonna like this one lmao
Love is in the Air,how about a documentary on american religious leaders?
Love is in the Air,If any of those guys are gay they are probably only into white guys
Love is in the Air,"How about sticking it to Scientology? Or the fundamentalist Mormons, et al. I don’t care about some “leaders” in Korea. Go after the predators at home and I might be impressed."
Love is in the Air,Netflix sucks haha
Love is in the Air,[removed]
Love is in the Air,"Good news, for sure, though I started watching this earlier this week and the production struck me as super odd. Might be a cultural thing, but the set design and editing is incongruous given the subject matter. 

Disclaimer: I only watched the first 15 mins of the opening episode."
Love is in the Air,"Religion doing what religion does.  But people want to be lied to, so on it goes."
Love is in the Air,The world is really fucked up.
Love is in the Air,">3rd March

btw"
Love is in the Air,"Yep. Was part of this cult before here in one their American branch and knew they we’re sketch since the beginning. Definitely members would manipulate to “evangelize” people. It’s flat out sad how many people are brainwashed and devoted to this cult and the leader. Insiders think that the media is just persecuting him and acting as a “devil” to bring down the “will of God”. His 10 years of imprisonment acts as Jesus dying on the cross to save us from our sins. His sermons are so boring and majority of the time, he just talks about himself."
Love is in the Air,"LPT: don't join cults, especially ones where the leader claims to be be God or claims to be speaking for God. Actually, just don't join any fucking cults."
Love is in the Air,"Oh some one sued to stop it. I wouldn't have watched it otherwise but now, straight on to the list."
Love is in the Air,Seriously though. Are there any NON religious sex cults?
Love is in the Air,I hope this series continues to expose more cults in Korea.
Love is in the Air,"I just want to ask if anyone else felt like this was fake or dramatized when first watching it? 

Not trying to be offensive because I watch sooo much true crime, something about this felt a bit staged (the interview, having the victim play an iPad video, film stalkers outside a hotel). I just didn’t want to get duped with a horrific story but being told by actors. Again, I am not saying the story isn’t true - it’s disgusting and I fucking hate religion. I especially seek out religious docs as I was brainwashed southern baptist as a kid. I hate to hear these stories! 

Just a vibe and didn’t see anyone else mention it."
Love is in the Air,"r/Shincheonji_Korea
It’s a place to discuss about cults in Korea including JMS"
Love is in the Air,"I still don't understand why the mother in episode 6 ""Baby Garden of Death"" didn't say her son was murdered in court, and still stuck to his heart failing? What was the point when the case had gotten that far and lied just to hate herself and wish death upon herself everyday? Did I miss something?"
Love is in the Air,"After having just read the Pope John Paul II and the sex abuse cover-ups, I was really hoping it would be the Catholic Church."
Love is in the Air,I would subscribe to a series where they did an in depth dive into every sect. If they find no evidence of a particular group they name drop them. I guess that would be an evolving form of journalism.
Love is in the Air,"I say, do the USA next!"
Love is in the Air,I know its a messed up system there and you only get real time if you dont have money in korea
Love is in the Air,"religion is the only part of society that coddles adults for submitting their critical faculties to a cult and wailing on about how more important their imaginary stories are than anything else going on in the objective reality we share. And you wonder how this hasn't been a magnet and cesspool for literal millenia, grifting entire societies for private ""sacred"" time with the children of the community, huddled around a bunch of decrepit old perverts.  Theism is child abuse, pure and simple. You want to con junkies and people who are at the bottom of their lives and have had all their defenses beaten out of them? That's one thing. Indoctrinating children before they've developed any cognitive defenses against shitty iron-aged emotional injunctions can fuck. right. off."
Love is in the Air,Reminds me of “silenced” about the sexual abuse and Kentucky sentences at a Korean school for the deaf.
Love is in the Air,Do they have any history of this sort of thing?
Love is in the Air,"Even though some viewers criticized JMS episodes for being too explicit, but in fact, those episodes were somewhat censored by the production team themselves. According to the director of the series, what was captured in those first three episodes was only about a tenth of what the victims actually suffered.


He said one of the reasons they brought the project to Netflix was to expose reality of those crimes. But even for Netflix, he had to watered down description of sexual assaults of JMS cause it was too upsetting for the viewers. Some of crew memebers suffered traumas for days after covering the case he said."
Love is in the Air,"The first thing you hear in the documentary is an audio recording of a rape in mid-intercourse, with some old man voice asking if the victim had an orgasm.  I did see the first minute or so of the interview, but I decided I didn't really want to see how far it was going to go after that."
Love is in the Air,"I was kind shocked they showed video of nude girls with blurred faces and unblurred bodies right after the stories of how he was raping teenagers. Aside from not being sure how old any of those girls were, it seems extremely exploitative of Netflix to just expose that to the public. It's fresh victimization even if only a handful of people know who they are."
Love is in the Air,"I have friends who turned to them and haven't heard from them in years. After joining they only ever wanted to hang out with me at their church events -> indoctrinate me.

Oddly enough they also said that Catholicism was satan or something. I also remember them believing that the end of the world is soon."
Love is in the Air,"I dated a woman for a short time who was a member of one of these cults in CA, only I didn't know it until I looked up the name of her ""pastor.""

Her ideas about certain things were just bizarre and didn't make sense with my understanding of most sects of Christianity."
Love is in the Air,i did too! weird way to grow up eh! there were some good times though. i think about the people a lot.
Love is in the Air,Midnight Mass on Netflix was a documentary 😌
Love is in the Air,"You will find predators in every system, willing and able to abuse their power dynamics."
Love is in the Air,"Religion is just a medium.  You can look at all the things that happened in Hollywood, that have nothing to do with religion to see that all it takes is generic promises from someone who appears to hold power to get some people to do things.

This isn't excusing people using religion in such a manner, just showing that religion is method, not the base reason these things happen."
Love is in the Air,"its literally built off that. The entire premise is that you must believe something without evidence, without understanding even. simple blind faith is required at the root of every religion.

anyone willing to believe in that is obv going to be more susceptible to other ideas with no proof, esp when they believe these orders are coming from God. Even easier if you can justify any of your ideas with weird interpretations of a text like the bible. And once you get some believers, their entire families usually get brought in"
Love is in the Air,"For real. Over the last 10 years I've noticed more and more how awful religions can be. People use this *coughChristianscough* as an excuse to do awful and hateful things. I get it that not all religious folks are bad, but it's difficult to not be jaded."
Love is in the Air,An extra pernicious part is how religion will make a point to call the parts of you they use to exploit as a “virtue”
Love is in the Air,"Reminds me of Tool’s song, ‘Opiate’"
Love is in the Air,If anyone prefaces their morality with religion.  There is zero morality.
Love is in the Air,Name?
Love is in the Air,Is this related to the unity Church?
Love is in the Air,"You can change it to Korean audio with subtitles, but yeah it's annoying because then any English audio will be in Korean if there is any."

Love is in the Air,"I can’t do any dubbing. I have tried but when I see the words not line up with the mouth, my brain just cringes and I have to turn it off"
Love is in the Air,That’s what I want to know! So many and so similar around the same time!
Love is in the Air,Saying JMS and those cults are Christianity is like saying Trump is a far left liberal.
Love is in the Air,Conformist societies fall easy prey to this kind of crap (see MLM schemes)
Love is in the Air,"You'd assume, but no. Smaller, more modern ones. 

I wouldn't be too surprised if Netflix did try to do something on the Moonies and ended up being much more hamstrung than this."
Love is in the Air,I feel so sick watching the former victim reliving the scene where she waved mops to jms. This documentary weirdly focuses on male gaze
Love is in the Air,Its a good documentary  but its pretty hard to watch. The first 5 min of the 1st episode has a sound recording of a rape. It gets pretty gory too.
Love is in the Air,"Pentacostals too. I've only heard testimonials from friends who have left churches of those denominations, but they definitely had wild experiences"
Love is in the Air,Then do a series. All American religions.
Love is in the Air,Organized religion is sinister sh!t.
Love is in the Air,"Or that Koreans are much better about reporting cults, rather than trying to hide shit?"
Love is in the Air,Do you think Chinese have freedom to make such documentary?

Grand Designs,"I LOVE THIS SHOW!  I found it on You Tube a few weeks ago and I can't get enough.  I'm not British so I had no idea this existed.  My favorite episodes are the ones where crazy people decide it's a good idea to renovate ruins.  The manor show was my favorite in that it takes a very special bravery to renovate a burned out manor house in France when you are 70 yrs old and don't speak the language.  

If you are not in The UK you have to have a VPN set to the UK to watch it, unfortunately, as You Tube blocks it for other countries.  EDIT: Netflix has seasons 11 and 12.  I previously stated they didn't carry the show.  

OP I agree with you that it is refreshing in that it doesn't force drama into the story line.  It's simply people trying their best to complete a labor of love."
Grand Designs,[David O'Doherty's Grand Designs song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKxO57g8kAI) is incredibly accurate.
Grand Designs,"Grand Designs is a definite guilty pleasure for me. Kevin McCloud is so good, i love the little engineering demos he does with whatever is lying around. He set a good time on old Top Gears lap board as well, top bloke.

There is an Australian and New Zealand version now as well, different hosts though but worth a look if you get the chance."
Grand Designs,"Whenever I think of Grand Designs I think of the little parody Charlie Brooker (creator of Black Mirror) did at the end of the Aspiration ep of How TV Ruined Your Life [from 27:30] (https://youtu.be/DUenIW_ogU4).

I've watched the show a few times and I must admit I have a similar view as the other person in this thread who resents the people splashing their cash on mad houses while I'm at home in my council house but my brother who's a quantity surveyor and friend who's an architect loves it. It's definitely a well made show and a must watch for people that like home/renovation shows."
Grand Designs,guess you've never seen White People Renovating Houses
Grand Designs,"It's on quite a few countries netflix including the US.

https://unogs.com/video/?v=80160755

It's also on channel 4 which might be UK region locked. It also requires a UK address to be inputted. Video was a bit laggy and it took 5-10 seconds before my mouse click to play went through. I almost thought it wasn't responding.

Grand Designs,"I love that show, there's so many cool & unique houses on it.  I love the historical rebuilds & the new crazy stuff, and the shots of the British countryside are so nice.  It calms me down to watch this show, but also really makes me really want to move overseas.  Did you ever watch the Isle of Skye episode?  That was one of my favorites, the way they incorporated the structures into the wild landscape of Skye."
Grand Designs,My Mum's godfather was on this show. The Adaptahaus episode if you see it.
Grand Designs,My wife and I are big fans of The Block (au)
Grand Designs,"If you like Kevin McCloud you should watch his documentary Slumming It. It's not Grand Designs or anything related to building, in fact he travels and lives in poverty in India. But as a documentary presenter it shows how goddam good he is. AFAIK it's on Youtube"
Grand Designs,Is this the one where they follow wealthy people transforming large and/or unusual homes?
Grand Designs,"Uhu, and since it doesn't feel like a reality tv show you become so invested haha."
Grand Designs,most of them exceed their budget. but it is a great show and i love it
Grand Designs,"My absolutely favourite episode is The Woodsman Cottage with Ben Law.  (Do a search on that episode, it's available on other platforms).

"
Grand Designs,Gosh darn. My VPN does not work with netflix. I love renovation shows so I would love to watch this. 
Grand Designs,The New Zealand one is pretty great- it's just airing its 3rd season.
Grand Designs,"They're keeping a lot of craftsmen & tradespeople in business, especially specialists that are not used on standard houses."
Grand Designs,Man as great as Black Mirror is I really wish Brooker still did things like that. The annual Wipe just isn't enough.
Grand Designs,All the other names were taken. 
Grand Designs,Yeh can confirm on US Netflix. It wants me to watch it because I watch “Escape to the Country.”  I’m disappointed that it’s a collection and only has ~20 episodes. But OPs post might have pushed me to watching Grand Designs. 
Grand Designs,"It's this one http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0421099/, sure there's episodes where its just rich people seeing what weird shit they can get away with but that's brings interesting challenges. The episodes I like most are fairly normal people wanting to spend no more then 300k and build something absolutely stunning because that feels more relatable."
Grand Designs,"This is because Kevin McCleod who hosts is brilliant. He is intelligent and well read. When he travels to France he speaks French to the locals, etc. There is no condescension or false drama; just curiosity and inspiration. Love it."
Grand Designs,"A lot of them should actually make a budget!  Love the show but when they start whining they are so far above what they thought they would spend and they didn't do a budget or even proper estimate, it drives me crazy.  Love Kevin and the show though!"
Grand Designs,I will watch it.  Thank you.  
Grand Designs,I love the straw houses. 
Grand Designs,I watched your favorite episode tonight and I liked it as well.  It's a shame he has to tear down the house when he leaves.  
Grand Designs,Mine stopped working a few months ago and I have a good one I pay for.  It stopped working on the BBC as well.  It seems everyone got wise to how out-of-country peeps access content.  
Grand Designs,Sure. I don't think they shouldn't be allowed to do it or anything - I just don't enjoy watching mansions being built from the comfort of my hovel. 🤷‍♀️
Grand Designs,"Agreed. I also wish we'd got more of his You Have Been Watching panel show and So Wrong It's Right radio panel show.

A whole new series of Screenwipe or Newswipe would be nice. He would've had so much gold to pick apart in recent years. 

But trawling through TV/News is a lot of work and he's got a kid now so I'm guessing he prefers to stick to creating stuff!"
Grand Designs,"That is the one I was thinking of. I don't watch it religiously (it is sometimes on in the background), but I have to say I have never seen an episode with ""normal"" people.

The only episodes I have seen are with people who have never had to worry about rent or a mortgage in their lives describing their challenges with their statement marble kitchen in a converted eco-barn.

Each to their own I suppose...can't stand it myself."
Grand Designs,"It makes me happy when Kevin McCloud goes off on a whimsical, arty tangent about whatever building he's looking at. He's usually so grounded and sensible on the show, but those are are moments where you can see the idealistic designer in him comes out."
Grand Designs,I don't think he will have to tear it down - they revisited Ben in later episodes and he has become a national treasure (see http://ben-law.co.uk/#about-ben-anchor).
Grand Designs,It's still pretty easy to switch Netflix/Youtube regions through DNS
Grand Designs,"I kind of look at it like escapism.  I mean, I doubt I will ever live anywhere like that, but it's fun to imagine it.  Plus, as a creative person I appreciate all the design & thought that the home builders put into their efforts.  There are some that aren't so pie in the sky, I remember one in particular that was really cool that was a housing collective where all the homeowners literally built the collective by themselves over like 4 years or something, I am pretty sure they were all considered lower income.  They did a follow up with them too, and all their kids had grown up there, it was really cool.  Here's a [link](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grand-designs-revisited/on-demand/31061-001) to the episode if you're curious."
Grand Designs,"I bet he's delighted with himself and his current situation....the creative, successful, almost certainly content bastard."
Grand Designs,"I think you and /u/probablylorde are being too hard on the home owners. There are wealthier people in the world doing more boring things with their new home construction.

I think the message is that if you are building a home, you can save a substantial amount of money while doing something spectacular with the right project planning.

I see this in the solar industry too. The customers willing to be more active in the design and project management phase end up with better solar arrays at substantially less than the market rate. "
Grand Designs,"There are plenty of episodes where the owners are self-building because they have little money. In a few episodes during the GFC, they couldn't sell their old house to pay for finishing the new one. 

In a few episodes the owners live in caravan onsite for several years. In at least one episode, an owner dies before the build is completed. "
Grand Designs,"Hmm, well I'm at season 12 and its at 18(?) now maybe it downgraded in quality.."
Grand Designs,"I mean if you're building a house you've got to be a bit on the wealthy side - but, I'd argue a middle aged couple spending $300k of savings and taking on $200k in mortgage is about as normal as it gets when it comes to home ownership."
Grand Designs,"There’s one episode where one of the homeowners is showing him round and says “these are the flat panels” trying to describe that they’re speakers but missing out the speaker part. Kevin’s response is “what what what what what? What do you MEAN flat panels? Flat panelled WHAT?” in the most comical way. Me and my ex watched the clip over and over. I heard that he was quite rude in real life and it shows through in the show sometimes, but it’s always quite amusing when it happens. "
Grand Designs,"Thanks for the rec, that ep does sound intriguing.

I'm honestly not as serious about it as I might've come off. It's just not my thing but it's a quality show and I recommend it to people interested in it. 
"
Grand Designs,"You are probably right. 

It irritates me when we have a property market where lots of people (particularly in the UK) have no prospect of ever owning their own home, and you get these people put in front of you on TV. 

I just can't relate to them or their problems in any way, so I have some personal bias there."
Grand Designs,"could be, i dont think that many seasons are on netflix."
Grand Designs,"Oh IDD - I havent seen all the episodes, and my view seems to be in the minority (downvoted into oblivion) so perhaps the episodes I have seen have been an unfair representation of the show. "
Grand Designs,"No worries, I just personally find it really inspiring & I like to recommend it as well.  It's especially strong when you compare it to all the other housing type shows on the air as well.  I've always been into weird architecture though, and I can forget that not everyone out there gives a shit about what I'm interested in."
Grand Designs,"You know, I really don't know how far the atrocious real estate values of London extend throughout the entire UK, so I could be the one in the wrong here. We should move to Canada and apologize to each other all day.

The show appeals to me because I am in building design. There's so much that could be done in terms of material selection (like this [building-integrated solar](http://www.stanmovers.com/building-design-for-solar-sunrooms/solar-sunrooms-beautiful-yellow-sunflowers-for-accent-striped-board-wooden-table-rustic-classic-appealing-dining-room-with-living/)) which could make lower end homes awesome and more cost-effective, but the builder isn't going to stick his neck out with changes when he already has the job in hand.

Also, most construction shows really like to push a message of ""you get what you pay for, so its a mistake to go with the low-end contractor"". Grand Designs I think is a bit more honest, essentially stating that high-end contractors can result in projects that are not cost-effective, whereas with low-end there may be additional project issues but if controlled, the extra hassle can be worthwhile.

You might like Reno my Reno on netflix. The host is kinda dopey and the designer is not very good. But it goes way more into low-end renovation techniques than other shows. 
"
Grand Designs,"There is a good mix, and definitely a good number about fairly wealthy people - although, I do like the fact that they don't have an easy time in those ones either."
Grand Designs,"I hadn't considered it from a building design viewpoint, but I totally understand what you are saying. Shows you how much perspective changes how people feel about shows like this :-)."
Grand Designs,Love Grand Designs. Kevin Mc Cloud is a legend. 
Grand Designs,"My favourite thing to do when watching Grand Designs is count the number of times KMac subtly undermines the husband.

If he's not banged at least one of the wives from this show I'll eat my own trousers."

Also, as you say, OP… it's still very watchable even if you're not that way inclined. That's all Kevin, really. I've never seen a host of this kind of show, that's been as pleasing and gently humorous, and actually friendly and helpful, too.

Grand Designs,"I find it depends on the people building the house really. Some can be humble and just want a nice, unique place to live others can be a bit obnoxious (in a British way).

Are you watching House of the Year currently airing on Channel 4? Last week was Extreme Houses and [Lochside House](https://www.architecture.com/awards-and-competitions-landing-page/awards/riba-regional-awards/rias-award-winners/2018/lochside-house) was stunning.

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Harry Potter but the magic is chess and Hagrid is tranquilizers.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it. I thought it would just be some ok drama about a ""genius"" chess player, but it was actually a hard look into brilliant vs mad. Her self-destructive behavior as a sort of coping mechanism. The possibility of a genetic component and the internal struggle with her dead mother's mental state and what that means for her own.

And lastly, the set design is dope. Those wallpapers were awesome."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,I am three episodes in and The Queen's Gambit is awesome!
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"When I saw on my Netflix front page I was actually really annoyed about the whole thing... Because the story of the real best woman chess player ever, Judit Polgar, is so fascinating. Like, why are you making up chess heroines with wild back stories? Judit's parents raised her and her sisters as basically a fully-documented experiment with the explicit plan from birth of making them grandmasters. I want an 8-part Netflix series about them dammit! But a Hungarian social experiment proving her crackpot father (partly) right to become a top-10 player in the world clearly will never have the same drawing power as an American orphan fighting against all odds. Really the player she resembles the most is Bobby Fischer, at least the whole ""no-one can beat the Russians"" plot.

Anyway I quickly overcame my gripes about the premise and fell completely in love with the show. I agree with OP's review that it doesn't quite dig deep enough into Beth's character - nor anyone else's. No-one is one-dimensional but everyone stops short of feeling quite fully fleshed out. And I would've loved to see more of that kid she met in Mexico! I kept hoping he would pop back up and he never did :(

Edit: I can't get the spoiler tag to work. Anyway good show very happy"

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,I still can't grasp why the ending left me so confused and melancholy despite it being a happy end which im normally completely fine with. I guess it has something to do with her character.

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,These posts are great. Keep it up!
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Hmm, from the name I would expect a different show. Maybe the reason it was canceled is that it was just poorly named."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,">Now I decided to skip Amy Seimetz' ""Bria"" storyline all together to be honest, because I don't think it's worth rewatching. From what I remember, it was low-budget, dreary and uneventful

It's very much in the vein of Seimetz' other works: it seems to wander aimlessly, but the story takes a backseat to the presentation, which is defined by the succession of Bria's emotions and is supported by incredible cinematography - very seductive (you can almost feel the desert heat), weird angles, plenty of of lens flares.

What sets this story apart from the rest of TGE, is how inescapable Bria's role as escort is. Even when provided with witness protection, a house, a job, she's still drawn to her chosen profession, because she's insatiable and being an escort provides her with more power and money than her ordinary factory job - she in effect becomes the counterpart of the very criminal she's hiding from, who also uses and discards his people and chases wealth through his life of crime and corruption.

This same mirroring of roles takes places in Kerrigan's half of season 2.

>Erica and Anna has quite a unique feel to it. The lack of extras and empty buildings complemented by far shots and and an absolutely brooding aura, all comes together in presentation of a very creative and unique cinematography... and it is fascinating to   
indulge in.

Very true. The sparse, clinical sets and at times extremely distant cinematography is something absolutely unique, and together with what you call the ""next to psychotic"" characters' behaviour it serves to underline the alienation the characters are experiencing, and, by extension, the viewer.

The question here is who the bigger prostitute is: Anna, who works as an escort girl and seems to take pride and enjoyment in what she's doing, or Erica, who is a political consultant and - in a way much more damaging to society - whores herself and her candidates out to corporations, as well as resorting to blackmail to get what she wants. Anna does wat she does because she enjoys it, whereas Erica's actions are driven by money (to enrich others!), and it's Erica who in the end breaks down and is nothing but an empty shell of a human being.

>A sloppy, inconsistent mess. The political plotline is vague and hard to follow, the love triangle plot is more entertaining, but very soapy

Viewed in a more ""traditional"" way, perhaps, but both halves of S2 are not plot-driven stories the way S1 was; S2's narratives seem only to exist in order to support the conveying of certain pictures, moods and ideas - in that way, S2 resembles much more something like *Too Old To Die Young* or *American Gods* than it does the other seasons of TGE.

Don't try to measure everything by the same yardstick - just be glad that some people are still willing to invest in more experimental television."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Your break down made me understood the Bria story way more than actually watching it made me did. 😂

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,">Your break down made me understood the Bria story way more than actually watching it made me did.

Glad to be of service, but mine is only one of many possible interpretations.

>Wow.... this is an interesting way of looking at things

That one's actually pretty on the nose - there are plenty more layers to peel off, many of those having to do with the transactional nature of relationships, a person's habitus, and, of course, capitalism.

There's a lot going on under the surface of S2, and both S2 stories distill the content *and* the presentation of S1 in such an extreme manner, that S2 becomes a completely different viewing experience - and with that a major turn-off for many people (who, like you, tend to see it as a ""sloppy, inconsistent mess""). Understandably so.

We're all aware why Starz airs a show like this - but honestly, it's so much more than tits and crime."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Yea your break down of this series is much better than mine, I must say. 😅 I can tell you really like the show, as you can tell by my post, I'm more interested in season 1 and that was my main reason for even watching it. 

Question though, have you seen season 3 yet? I'm going to watch it tomorrow. Can you give me your un-spoilered take??"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Of course.

You're definitely going to enjoy it. It's a bit more conventional than S2, and thus serves as a more immediate follow-up to S1. Especially in the first half, the show focuses heavily on ""the girlfriend experience"", taking the time (like in S1) to more thoroughly explore the girlfriend-client interactions. S3 is a bit more compact than S1, and even though that works fine, I think it could have done with a few additional episodes tacked on in order to explore some issues more deeply.

It has great music, and excellent cinematography - although here it fails to reach the heights of S2. Also, most of the acting is unfortunately not on the level of S1, but the lead (Telles) is very strong, and her good-natured Iris may fool you into thinking she's pretty normal, when in fact she's just as sociopathic as Christine.

Try and pay close attention to:

* the parallels between Iris's day and night jobs: the commodification of ""the human experience"" (body, intellect, emotions - the whole shebang)
* the connection between what Iris does at her day job and what's happening to her father - and how this influences/changes her final decision

Apart from the obvious themes (money, power, ""free will"", etc.), there's a lot of ""trans"" themes in S3: transfiguration, transhumanism, transcience vs eternity, and identity (we can't seem to get around that last one, nowadays). You could also take note of the use of colour, since it seems to convey Iris's moods at times.

Excuse the vagueness, but you wanted it ""un-spoilered""..."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,I enjoyed Peacemaker a lot.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,The Bear was very good. I binged it this week.

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,I haven't watched much new stuff this year but I am enjoying Irma Vep and Our Flag Means Death. I was super excited to see Pachinko but i'm waiting to cycle out a streaming service before I get Apple TV+. I'm not going to pay for more than two at a time.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Peacemaker, can’t believe a show with John Cena as the lead is actually good"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Severance

Peacemaker

1883 (pretty sure it was 2022 but might be December can’t remember).

Slow horses

Haven’t watched too much new stuff I’m gonna have to check some of these out."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"I think out of these I would have to say Pam and Tommy. Good actors and writing, I thought the subject matter would be pretty tasteless but they managed to do it in a way that works"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"My favorites for this year so far are

The Bear

The Boys

The Staircase- This was far better than the description makes it seem.

Ms. Marvel

Winning Time

Severance

I am certain Better Call Saul would be at the top if I had seen it."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Severance and The Bear are my favorite shows of the year so far.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Bear is not in it?
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Slow horses
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Recently just finished All of Us Are Dead….a 9.3? I mean to each his own, but that’s waaaaay too high lol. It had its moments and it ain’t really bad, but there’s a lot of stupidity in its writing that doesn’t justify that rating.

The first half was so slow and a lot could’ve been removed, characters doing the same dumb stuff again, and again, again. A lot of dropped and irrelevant plot lines."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"I binged the terminal list yesterday, hoping it would get better but it never did. It wasn't a thinker at all, it was revenge porn sprinkled with product placement."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"For All Mankind

Severance"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Have to admit that Pachinko and All of Us Are Dead would feature high up my list as well. Pachinko probably at the very top! 

Some great stuff I’ve watched that you have not mentioned incudes As We See It, Yellowjackets, The Gilded Age, Winning Time, The Dropout, WeCrashed, The King (Il Re), Night Sky, and Blocco 181.

I’ll admit to also quite enjoying My Dress Up Darling. I’ve not done a ton of new anime but it was the best of what I’ve seen this year for sure."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,I mean if we’re not talking new shows the best tv of the year by far is Better Call Saul and I don’t think there’s much of an argument for anything else
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Best: Peacemaker, Tokyo Vice, Severance, Julia, Bang Bang Baby.
Worst: All of us are dead, Naomi, Pieces of her, Reacher, Bienvenidos a Eden."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Obi-Wan is excellent
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"My 10 favorite new on-going shows of the year so far...

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Severance 
Better call saul
Stranger Things
Peacemaker 
The Boys"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Best: *The Old Man*

Worst: *God's Favorite Idiot*"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"I disagree with ""All of Us are Dead."" The show's totally unwatchable. All characters are stupid. Sure, everyone is going to have one or two bad choices in a situation like that, but I've never seen this show do something with the zombie genre that's fresh.

The humor in ""Peacemaker"" surely beats everything else this year, but ""Doom Patrol"" had really funny short moments, too. I especially like that moment in the first episode of season 3 when Niles was ready to have threesome sex with the ghosts, but then he had to vanish before he could even unzip his pants. This is a terribly description, but if you saw that scene, you'll know. Sometimes, comedy is not about the lines the characters throw.

Another show I really loved watching was ""Paris Police 1900."" I am happy to know they're working on the second season.

I have yet to finish ""We Own This City"" and ""The Baby,"" but so far, the episodes I've watched are good."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,I tried to watch *Winning Time* but I could only get through one episode. All the editing and visual effects were just way too much. Combined with the actual players and coaches complaining about how fictionalized the story is made me decide to stop watching.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Winning time and the old man have gotten me excited for tv again, after a lull of being uninspired"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"The Old Man, Shoresy, The Bear"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,From would probably be top of my list.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,same.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,That and Umbrella academy.

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Slow Horses is so good🙂 Tokyo Vice also.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"‘From‘ is cool

like LOST plus “Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight” 

I’m just worried were going to get unanswered questions or canceled before an ending"
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Definitely watching The Bear as soon as it drops on digital. 

Haven't seen a Marvel show since Wandavision, but might do Ms. Marvel."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,haven't seen it yet. will do.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"haven't heard of this one. but eeeeeh, only think that's appealing to me here is Riley Keough."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"We in S3 of For All Mankind, it's not a new show."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,">I’ve not done a ton of new anime

I've only seen one new anime, as you can see. Usually I would've seen a lot more but just didn't have the time to venture into that world. I'm literally clueless as to what the HOT anime were this past winter & spring seasons. I know Spy x Family, but I'm waiting on that one to complete its run before I watch it. 

&#x200B;

>Yellowjackets

I've actually seen it. I don't think I liked it as much as most seemed to though. It's like... a 7/10 for me maybe. That whole flashback-driven storytelling technique is something I've grown so tired of. 

As for the others, I've come across The Dropout, The Gilded Age and WeCrashed but just wasn't interested. Might still check out Winning Time. Literally never heard of the others, but amma google em. 

&#x200B;

>Have to admit that Pachinko and All of Us Are Dead would feature high up my list as well.  

Surprisingly I've seen a few comments from people who didn't like All of Us Are Dead, and I have soooo many questions because, *how could one not like that show!!* Lol. But it's cool."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"I don't watch Star Wars so I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. But I thought this was the one I was seeing praises about 🤔.... or maybe it was another one, idk."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"I've seen a few negative comments for All Of Us Are Dead now and I'm actually surprised? 

> All characters are stupid.

Elaborate? I mean the majority are teenagers (as this is a teen-drama at its core), but also, what *stupid decisions* did you think these characters made that was so outlandish? 

> I've never seen this show do something with the zombie genre that's fresh.

I'd say the 'asymptomatic zombies' is something new... but maybe *you* have seen it before? I don't know. This is also the first time I've seen a teen-drama get pushed into a zombie apocalyptic setting (as I even mentioned here in a [previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/iecu9vy)). I also love the way it throws traditional kung-fu fight scenes in the mix."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,[deleted]
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"Good thing that we're getting a second season, hopefully that will give John Griffin the opportunity to plan the entire series. 

I was a bit worried about a cancellation since the show was on Epix, but I guess the ratings were probably good enough for them, also it doesn't hurt having The Russo Brothers as producers."

Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,"It's cool.  I'm 51 and grew up with all of the SW content.  We find a lot of the hate isn't from my generation.  Liking or not liking something means we are horrible people, or something like that, lol."
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,They're getting downvoted because r/television seems to really hate the show. It really depends what subreddit you're in as far as how people are responding to it. r/StarWars seems to really like it.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,Who cares if people make negative comments about a show you like? It's not a personal attack so don't take it personally
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,lol i do watch The Boys. its existence doesn't mean marvel shows can't be good or entertaining.
Tokyo Magnitude 8.0,yep-yup. tv time app does more for me than this sub nowadays tho. this sub doesn't talk about the hidden gems like it once used to.

VeggieTales in the City,Phil Vischer recently put out a pretty good video explaining [the basics of white privilege.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGUwcs9qJXY)
VeggieTales in the City,"Why does this seem to bother some of you folks? I mean, whats wrong with black talent portraying black characters in animation?"
VeggieTales in the City,"Do people not know that DarthVader who is white is voiced by James Earl Jones a black man? Why didn’t people go after him for voicing someone outside his race?

Or how Kevin Michael Richardson voiced Joker in the 2004 Batman who was also white (not just bleached skin we do see him before the chemicals and he’s a white guy)

The whole point of acting is to be someone else. People shouldn’t prevent actors from playing characters simply based on race"
VeggieTales in the City,"it feels regressive, to me, to require that the ethnicity of the cartoon match that of the actor voicing it. Isn't it easy to imagine a white nationalist making this same demand--'whites should only voice white characters'

I also wonder if this would lead to less diverse casts. Jenny Slate and Allison Brie were 2 high profile examples of white actors voicing non-white characters. I'm guessing that the creators of those shows were more invested in having those actors than they were in those characters being non-white."
VeggieTales in the City,Maybe because it’s a fucking vegetable?
VeggieTales in the City,Has there been any news on when is City Primeval airing? I think it is unlikely that it will air in Spring now since it will miss the Emmy deadline.

Source: am rewatching it now."
VeggieTales in the City,"*""Just* ahead of?"" Where does this come from? No release date has been announced, and while I don't think ""Decades ahead of"" is likely to be true, ""Just ahead of"" is ridiculously misleading. So ... clickbait, right?"

VeggieTales in the City,The first few seasons are great but the show gets very repetitive
VeggieTales in the City,[deleted]
VeggieTales in the City,Great show but the last season is pretty bad.
VeggieTales in the City,I look at the original Justified TV show on wiki and it says the ratings are only about 2 million but it seems to be very popular. Why the low ratings ? And does such ratings justify a revival?
VeggieTales in the City,I hope they add Justified even in Europe to Disney+ alongside The Americans and Sons of Anarchy. (or Man Seeking Woman). But I am really looking forward to this one.
VeggieTales in the City,Probably end of the year/end of summer.

VeggieTales in the City,I've been watching it for the first time. I'm on season 6 now and I'm going to miss this show once it's over. It's also on the CTV app.

VeggieTales in the City,Also on the CTV app for people who don't have prime.
VeggieTales in the City,"It's on Hulu in the US, like most of the Disney-owned ""adult"" properties.

Edit: Also it's an FX show, and that's where they keep the FX stuff."
VeggieTales in the City,Wish it was Disney+ in the U.S. would love a rewatch but not spending more on another streaming service
VeggieTales in the City,Everyone's entitled to their opinion but I'm not quite sure how you managed to arrive at yours.
VeggieTales in the City,"I feel like the opposite is true, and it starts a little repetitive but finds its footing?"

VeggieTales in the City,Disney+ in Canada also has Hulu content since we don’t get Hulu up here. Plenty of FX shows end up on there. It’s pretty great.
VeggieTales in the City,"seems to be what they're doing in most places, putting everything on Disney+. whereas in the US, aside from the Marvel TV shows (Daredevil, Jessica Jones and such), they put the 'adult' stuff on Hulu instead"
VeggieTales in the City,"eh, that's nothing really out of the ordinary for a show on cable tv these days. everyone here (rightly) loves Better Call Saul and that averaged barely above 1 million viewers in its final season. those numbers don't factor in people watching shows on streaming services or whatever"

You’re in for an amazing finish. 

And rejoice cuz some of us have felt it’s absence for so so many years. 

Now it comes back and he’s finally gonna deal with Detroit and the villain they cast is Boyd Holbrook and Tarantino producing it from an amazing source book.

VeggieTales in the City,"It starts off as a case of the week, procedural before slowly switching to a more serialized arc.   I always figured it was always intended to be more serialized but they had to ease into it to get everyone on board."
VeggieTales in the City,I believe Tim said in an interview never say never about them doing more in the future. I think he's always open to it anyway.
VeggieTales in the City,"Haven’t watched yet, too bad :( I’ll just continue along through season 4 of my justified rewatch."
VeggieTales in the City,"i know The Americans was on Amazon Prime for a pretty long time until recently moving to Hulu. i *think* that might've been the case for Justified, too"
VeggieTales in the City,You’re right. I meant that Disney had the license for streaming and didn't clarify my original comment after the edit.
VeggieTales in the City,Disney owns FX
VeggieTales in the City,That's more than zero dollars.
VeggieTales in the City,"Well, considering the main character is a LEO then what else could the show be about?"
VeggieTales in the City,It was. Both were on Prime for a few years before switching to Hulu.
VeggieTales in the City,"Yeah I know. But Sony is the official distributor of that show. They make it for FX but at the end of the day, they hold international rights for the show. Looks like a licensing deal between Disney and Sony is allowing this show to be streamed on Disney+ in Canada. Justified has been licensed to Prime Video where I live."
VeggieTales in the City,"- Starts as a film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

- Almost a decade passes and no progress on the film.

- It goes to Hulu as a limited series.

- Less than a year later, Reeves leaves and so does Field.

- Limited series is now scrapped.

Hmmm, I'm starting to think this adaptation is cursed."

Please just get some history nut veteran showrunner an HBO budget and cast Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham.

Edit:

> In recent weeks, Jeremy Allen White and Jude Law were in talks to star but in the end, the entire project fell through. Was it the deals or was it a top-down message that an expensive period piece wasn't the way Hulu should go?

VeggieTales in the City,"Man this project certainly fell apart. Went from having a lead actor, director and a network last year to none this year."
VeggieTales in the City,"With all the crap that streaming turns out, this one can't make the cut?"
VeggieTales in the City,"Feels like every year or two I hear new names attached to this project and then it disappears. Same goes with Blood Meridian. TBF, both seem like they'd be very difficult adaptations."

VeggieTales in the City,"I literally just finished this book. If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

Edit: I actually really enjoyed the fair sections, I just can’t imagine that be very exciting because a lot if it was about choosing architects, floral designs and such. They’ll probably play up the fires and such, though."
VeggieTales in the City,"Had a feeling this was a dead series when Keanu dropped out. 

It seems like a weird project to adapt. A story about the creation of a giant expo and a story about a serial killer, neither of which have anything to do with another.

I'm surprised nobody has decided to ditch the part about the World's Fair and do a film about HH Holmes. It's probably all the parts about the World's Fair and recreating it is what would cause the project to have a giant budget."
VeggieTales in the City,Hard -- in the visual media -- trying to figure out how to fit in 3 episodes on architectural history in the middle of a story about a serial murderer.
VeggieTales in the City,This and “Confederacy of Dunces” have pissed off the adaptation gods and just can’t get out of development purgatory.
VeggieTales in the City,"Depending on your definition of progress, there was a lot of it on Scorsese’s film version. There’s a couple different drafts of the script floating around online, and probably several other versions that never emerged anywhere. Lot of writers worked on that movie over the years."
VeggieTales in the City,"A real shame, this would be a pretty epic 3hr movie more than a series IMO. DiCaprio would have been perfect too."
VeggieTales in the City,A Scorcese and DiCaprio vehicle sounds like a non-brainer to begin with. Really weird why it didn't go to completion at that first step tbh
VeggieTales in the City,"I remember first reading Devil In the White City because it was an inspiration for the then-upcoming Bioshock Infinite. 

That was ten years ago this month."
VeggieTales in the City,Pretty sure that before Leo and Scorcese Tom Cruise was attached to it as well.
VeggieTales in the City,It has been an emotional journey to follow along the whole time
VeggieTales in the City,Has Robert Eggers ever expressed interest in show running?
VeggieTales in the City,"Nick Offerman as Daniel Burnham?

Speaking of being so close..."
VeggieTales in the City,"Attaching huge names might be the problem. Star power is expensive and difficult to schedule unless it’s their passion project. Cast some unknowns. Grab an up and coming director. Save a bundle and give someone new a chance. If the production is good and the people behind it are talented, you don’t need star power."
VeggieTales in the City,"> Jesus Christ, why has no one in 20 years been able to crack it? 

Because the best parts of the book would make for one really dull drama. The best parts of the book was about the architecture of Chicago and the work done to put on the world's fair.

All the shit about HH Holmes is really a pretty forgettable story about a serial killer. 

The only thing interesting that Holmes did is he built an elaborate torture chamber. 

So at the end of the day they only options for story telling is about someone building things."
VeggieTales in the City,The show runner wanted to turn the show into something else. The main cast were pretty good but they didn't have a lot to work with. Alienated anyone who liked the source and didn't attract any of whatever demographic they were aiming for.
VeggieTales in the City,"Setting aside the question of whether you could make a direct adaptation of Y: The Last Man today, not having the Israelis and Amazons essentially got rid of the antagonists from the comics. That adaptation was a bit like making a Harry Potter movie without Voldemort and the Death Eaters, where Lily and James Potter really did die in a car crash.

Whether or not a slow burn quasi political post-apocalyptic story is something anyone has ever been interested in watching is something I think is fairly clearly answered by the fact no other show like that exists. Maybe such a programme (of film) *should* exist, but it's pretty clear they were just using the framework of the IP to trick people into watching/greenlighting what was a fundamentally different story. Sort of like Foundation except people didn't really like the new plotline. I suggest the major difference is, and I haven't read Foundation, that the Lee Pace stuff is kinda necessary for anything in Foundation to make sense, whereas in Y: The Last Man the politics stuff exists in an inherent tension with what the main characters are trying to do. Having a storyline about ""what comes next"" after a world shattering event, is a bit nuts when your ostensible main characters are trying to shatter the foundations of this new world.

They also made specific changes to Yorick and Mann that made both of them much harder to sympathise with. Alas, the specific change to Yorick was destructive to his entire character concept from the comics. Show Yorick knows Beth wanted to end things, whereas comics Yorick is sort of this hopeless romantic, which is endearing... even as the audience knows his mission *should* be doomed to failure (due to dramatic irony).

There are worse ways to make an adaptation, but Y: The Last Man's failure is clearly on how they tried to adapt it, not that they tried to adapt it in the first place."
VeggieTales in the City,"God if there was one comic that seemed to be an easy homerun it was Y last man. I really liked the first episode or two but then they decided to completely stall the story and change shit around. Same thing happened with preacher, yeah let's just spend an entire season focusing on shit that has nothing to do with the comic. TWD started great and faithful to the source material then got bogged down. The Witcher, eugh. 

If the last of us has a lasting impact I hope it's that the people with the money find someone who loves and understands the source material and let's them stay faithful."
VeggieTales in the City,"I finished the book the other month and after a certain point found the Holmes stuff to be an absolute drag on what I really wanted to get back to, which was Frederick Olmsted getting really annoyed over the specifics of park designs."
VeggieTales in the City,"Everyone can have their favorite parts, but if prior to reading the book you had told me I would dismiss much of the serial killer stuff and be profoundly captivated by the 1893 Colombian Exposition I would have laughed at you. But that’s what happened. The World’s Fair stuff is magical. And if I was ever offered an opportunity to go back to a time and place, it would be Chicago the year it opened."
VeggieTales in the City,"> If they do the Worlds Fair parts, it would make for a boring movie.

That also seems like it would be prohibitively expensive. They'd need a huge budget for sets and CGI extensions to show off the large scale of structures and workers and show all the progress over time in building the fair. Not to mention of course its a period piece which makes everything more pricey."
VeggieTales in the City,That's literally the only part I care about!
VeggieTales in the City,Disagree greatly.
VeggieTales in the City,"The race to put together the World’s Fair is the actual story though, it’s not in the middle of a story about a serial killer. And there’s a lot of dramatic thrust there, wouldn’t be hard to structure it in an episodic format. It’s not like it’s just dudes staring at blueprints, there’s fires and storms and huge egos and crazy people coming from around the world and people dying under construction failures.

If anything in the book the HH Holmes stuff gets kinda repetitive and feels tacked on. It’s pretty clear to me that Larson wanted to write a book about the World’s Fair and the publisher made him include a serial killer hook."
VeggieTales in the City,"And a 20 minute aside on the layout of the fair and the risk of flooding that they had to avoid.


It why I never read Thunderstruck also by Erik Larson it's the same schtick of a bunch of interwoven events occuring and some just aren't interesting."
VeggieTales in the City,"Blood Meridian, too. 

I had no idea Confederacy of Dunces had been through adaptation hell. I feel like that one would require exceptionally gifted writers. The line between hilariously off-kilter and just weird seems like it'd be very fine for this one."
VeggieTales in the City,Throw *Neuromancer* in there too.
VeggieTales in the City,The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is another great book that has had an adaptation in development hell for many years.
Legend Quest,"Hey Netflix, get iron chef Japan on there instead please"
Legend Quest,"No real surprise to see Kristen Kish getting some spotlight. She is a fantastic chef, previous top chef winner and always stands out as a personality when she’s on TV. I’m glad to see it."
Legend Quest,So strange seeing Alton on Netflix.
Legend Quest,I instead choose the title of zinc saucier.
Legend Quest,Release date is June 15th.
Legend Quest,Pluto tv has an Iron Chef channel that plays the Japanese series 24/7. It is free but has ads.
Legend Quest,"For realz. I like Alton, and Cacascos has been my guy for a long time. But it doesn't compare to the OG show."
Legend Quest,She gets the spotlight on Fast Foodies.
Legend Quest,Why?
Legend Quest,"Damn, thanks!"
Legend Quest,"There is only 2 minutes left and he hasn't plated yet!

He is going for the icecream machine!"
Legend Quest,There's an Iron Chef channel on Pluto TV and I absolutely love it.
Legend Quest,As long as it stays true to the original and NOT Iron Chef America.
Legend Quest,[Irona Kukkuruu!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggEQwBETbsI)
Legend Quest,"Petition to bring back the dynamic duo of Fukui-san and Ohta-san as announcer and floor reporter, respectively (along with their dubbed voice actors)."
Legend Quest,"The dubbed version was best. 

“Qui-zon, I believe he was using butter in that dish”"
Legend Quest,"Not sure how I feel about this one.  I loved watching the original Iron Chef as a kid, so if it stays true to those roots, it could be good."
Legend Quest,"Sure why not, it was always good fun tv, everybody loves food"
Legend Quest,I'll just take the lesser title Iron Saucier.  And it comes with double prize money!
Legend Quest,I’ve been binging that for the last couple weeks as I’ve recovered from surgery. So much fun! I’ve not seen it since about 12-15 years ago.
Legend Quest,The show is available on YouTube but the Pluto tv channel is better quality. I've seen some eps I had never seen before too.
Legend Quest,"At least Iron Chef America was better than Iron Chef USA, if anyone (unfortunately) remembers that one."
Legend Quest,"Yeah I want to see chefs making dessert out of weird stuff like eel brains or goat livers, not pumpkin or beets."
Legend Quest,“Fukui-san”
Legend Quest,"Thank You, I never knew exactly what they were saying or how to spell it…TIL :)"
Legend Quest,Are you calling Spain a hispano-american country? lol
Legend Quest,It doesnt look very good tbh. Prob wont bother.
Legend Quest,[deleted]
Legend Quest,"Oh, Spain? Burritos!"
Legend Quest,"With shill, you mean if it's a ""please upvote my post"" or a ""please watch this series in a mandatory way""? No, it's not. Please read the post and you'll see that what I mean is that it's difficult to support this kind of series due to the factors I mention. After reading, anybody can decide if to watch the show or not."
Legend Quest,Who is your favorite actor on the Players cast and why is it me?
Legend Quest,"I haven't gotten around watching Players yet but, do you guys have any interest in revisiting American Vandal in the future?"
Legend Quest,[deleted]
Legend Quest,"Hi, there! 

Big fan of American Vandal! Haven’t started Players yet, but I’ll get on that ASAP. 

To me, it feels like the true crime documentary genre feels a bit over saturated, especially on Netflix. I haven’t had a chance to really dive into the genre, but what are your recommendations? Could you also share something that inspired you from these recommendations?"
Legend Quest,What would each member of Fugitives choose as their worlds skin when they win worlds?
Legend Quest,"How did you decide on the various ""Screen Names"" for players?"
Legend Quest,"Does any of you actually play league of legends?
I'm asking beyond learning the basics for the role, like as an actual hobby"
Legend Quest,"Been watching this with my partner, who does not play League. We've found it entertaining so far and it has been a great way for her to connect with me on one of my interests without playing the game, which she's not interested in."
Legend Quest,When you released the trailer for the mockumentary did you expect so many people to think it was a real documentary?
Legend Quest,"A few of Fugitive's non-central players are acted by real pro players. What was the process of casting them like? Was it planned from the start, or was it a matter of testing the waters and liking the results?

Also, what gave you the confidence to make Nightfall the lead focus of an episode?"
Legend Quest,"Oh yoooo....I'm currently anxiously awaiting the final 3 episodes of Players and definitely have a question for you.

Do you both actually play the game or follow eSports? If not, how were you able to not only completely nail the lingo/slang/memes/overall feel, but have the actors deliver it all totally naturally?

There hasn't been a single character so far that sounds like they don't know what they're talking about when they get really in the weeds with LoL or gaming stuff, and I have to think that not all of them (if any of them) are actual hardcore gamers.

Misha Brooks is amazing as Creamcheese...was anybody else even considered?"
Legend Quest,"What was the process of getting American Vandal produced like?  I’d also love some insight into how you went about writing the show - are you all working off outlines like Curb, is it tightly scripted, or is it somewhere between?

Huge fans of your work!"
Legend Quest,"Ive been blowing up paramount+ twitter trying to buy a creamcheese, or even perhaps a nut milk jersey. Can you please tell me how to make this happen?!?!

Im hesitant to make this statement for a show that hasn't concluded, but this honestly might be one of the best shows to ever exist. Perfectly executed on all fronts. The fact that you could enjoy this show with or without knowing League, is amazing. I anxiously await Thursdays just to watch.

My question: With AV, your stories have essentially been ""one and done"" in terms of seasons. Will this be any different? (Really hoping you guys continue this story somehow. thats truly how great it is)."
Legend Quest,[deleted]
Legend Quest,Can you tell us a bit more about creating the character Creamcheese? Did you apply same creative parameters when creating a character like Dylan on Vandal?
Legend Quest,"I don't have any questions, I just wanted to say as a long time LCS fan, this show is amazing. It nails the feel of the LCS exactly, even the older days of it. This was a huge surprise to watch, I'm just thankful you guys made it, and made it so well."
Legend Quest,"Thanks so much for this series, really loved it so far. 

Were there any influencers or pro players that you wanted to be involved or featured but it didn't work out?

Going into it did you have an idea about esports legends stories that you knew you wanted to portray on screen and were there any that you ended up not using?"
Legend Quest,"I just want to thank you for American Vandal and for the incredible memories of watching seasons 1 and 2 which was some of the best television of the past 15 years and the incredible portraits of 2010s high school mixed with biting humor.

My questions are what are some of your comedic influences and do you allow your actors do some ad libs or is it fully scripted?"
Legend Quest,Was The Last Dance any inspiration this new series?
Legend Quest,"Hi guys-- huge Vandal fan, was super stoked to hear you were tackling another project set in a world I'm incredibly invested in.   


eSports is insane and wonderful in a lot of ways, but it gets a lot of (deserved) flak for being a very male-focused entertainment culture especially when it comes to the people participating and driving it. The past couple of years have gladly seen some positive shifts away from that direction with new great analyst desk members like Emily Rand, casters like Froskurinn and increasingly-popular journalists like Ashley Kang, but there's of course always room for improvement.   


My question is-- is the very gendered culture something you and your writers were at all aware of going into this project, and if so, how did you choose to consider or tackle it? April is a *great* character and it's awesome to see she's one of the only people around Fugitive with her shit consistently together."
Legend Quest,"Absolutely loving this series, and I've never been a gamer."
Legend Quest,"how much help and feedback did the LCS players give you? I must imagine it's definitely a challenge stepping into a completely different world, what were some things that were no where near what you expected?"
Legend Quest,After watching 7 episodes I really liked how you guys used real phrases that are used within the community and also included things that reference the gaming community outside of LOL. How did you decide which slang/gamer-talk and real life references make it in the show?
Legend Quest,For the scenes in flash backs where they show old game footage was that pre recorded at that time or did riot have a way of recording the old game play for the documentary
Legend Quest,"Hullo!

Players spoofs and takes a lot from sports documentaries like Drive to Survive and The Last Dance both within the script and visually. What I want to know is whether you two watched the now-infamous Team Liquid documentary ""Breaking Point"" and if so, what your initial reactions were to it. 

Additionally, esports occupies this weird space where so many things have been brought over from traditional sports (tsports, heh) and don't fit quite right and/or are more interesting for being less polished and less professional despite having similar business frameworks or even sometimes the same owners/ownership group. Part of the overarching joke or punchline of Players is due to this nebulous space so how did you find a balance for this within your script? 

Finally I'll say that this never would have been as good as it is if it wasn't apparent that the ""show"" (or in-universe documentary team) actually cares about the characters and the space while taking the piss out of it. I think that's Players' largest success."
Legend Quest,This has been a lot of fun. Thanks for all of your questions! That's it for us on this thread. Time to go back to lurking r/leagueoflegends for more storylines.
Legend Quest,Ok I've seen commercials for Players and thought it was totally real and was like wtf? But this makes so much sense! American vandal is incredible! Super underrated show that should have performed better. Thank you for all of your hard work!!!
Legend Quest,What are some of your favorite documentaries?
Legend Quest,"1st Question: How did you decide that you wanted to fuse Dardoch and Doublelift together to make Cream Cheese?   


2nd Question: Would he be named DardoLift or DoubleDoch?"
Legend Quest,"I just want to say that American Vandal was absolutely amazing. The pacing, the dialogue, the humor, the great acting performances. In season 1, I kept laughing about the fact that I was really wanting to know 'who drew the dicks?' Everything about it was brilliant.

I will definitely check out Players as soon as possible."
Legend Quest,"Long time fan, first time AMA commenter. Of all the different games in the esport world, what drew you to League of Legends?"
Legend Quest,"How did you film the in game footage? Im curious who is playing ""Creamcheese"", etc when you show in game plays. Was it Riot's in game Q&A department or a random selection of ""whoever we can get whose available who is halfway decent at the game"" sort of thing?"
Legend Quest,"Just wanted to say I am a huge fan of American Vandal. Its a show I revist often when I need a laugh. IMO it has one of the best depictions of high school. 

2 questions

1. Are there any jokes or bits from either AV or Players that you are particularly fond of? 

2. Something I really enjoyed about American Vandal is that behind all the dick or poop jokes there was this underlying theme of loneliness and expectations(and much more really). Do you tend to find that the theme of the story comes first or the general plot?"
Legend Quest,"I guess this has ended, but if not:

The chronology of the show is really impressive. I'm interested how you went about maintaining the multiple different eras on the timeline, both in the room and during shooting. Also interested to hear how you went about including the actual footage of the cast as children; what a resource it is that everyone now has an archive of personal footage."
Legend Quest,"This is such a great ama so far and I've watched your interview also with Travis Gafford last month as well. I love the show and your genuine affection for the scene. Thanks for doing this ama!

My question is - at what moment did esports really click for you as a real competitive sport?"
Legend Quest,"Hey guys! I've really enjoyed Players so far and also really liked what I've seen of American Vandal so far (watching it with my siblings and on the 2nd season, would binge it if I didn't need to wait for them otherwise). As a long time LCS, League, and esports viewer general I've felt immersed with how the team and characters fit in to this world that I'm already very acquainted with and I have little to no complaints with how it all meshes. The question I have is how you guys decided that 2016 was the year Fugitive to be promoted. To me, the early beginnings of Fugitive getting into the LCS give off a promoted in 2013 or 2014 type beat. Of course, this is entirely subjective and there's no right or wrong year for them to get promoted (ofc except those that are before the founding of the LCS and after franchising), but I'm very interested in why 2016?"
Legend Quest,Not a question but I absolutely love you
Legend Quest,What are the conversations like when you work with real esports brands while making the show? Do orgs like 100Thieves or TSM get upset if they have a poor record/get beaten in the show? Or is it all in good fun?
Legend Quest,"One of the most common reactions to the show that we've seen is ""This is more entertaining that any content the current teams are putting out."" Players basically points out every flaw that exists with current LCS content coming from the organization side.

Given that you've spent a lot of time around players, teams, and the LCS in general to create the show, what do you think teams can do to make content more compelling for fans?"
Legend Quest,"Can you please give Fredo a scratch for me, Tony?"
Legend Quest,"Did you name the character “Lou” (another word for bathroom) to throw us off in Season 2, since ppl put together the names in season 1?"
Legend Quest,"Do you guys look to Christopher Guest or Rob Riener for inspiration? My first watch of Vandal I was like ""hell yeah this is best of show but made for and by my generation and I'm here for it!"""
Legend Quest,"Not a question: please give us more American Vandal, it was/is perfect"
Legend Quest,"I'm sure you have nothing to do with this, but as a comment, you need to fire your marketing team.

I LOVED American Vandal.

I'm an avid League player.

The ads for the show have made me never want to watch this show.

1. Paramount+ should not air the same ad for the same show on repeat for every show watched on their program. It just makes you hate whatever they are advertising. Hulu made this SAME mistake in their early days and suffered greatly for it. 

2. The ads barely communicate that it's a comedy nor that it's about League of Legends."
Legend Quest,"Hey, no question, but as a Rito employee I just wanted to say you guys did a great job. GGWP"
Legend Quest,Which one of y'all got a handjob at a lake and which one mapped it out?
Legend Quest,No question just wanted to say no matter what you do keep working with Holly Chou. She's amazing.
Legend Quest,"1. why such an uninspiring title?
2. is it possible to watch it (legally) outside of NA? if yes, how?"
Legend Quest,"Why suck the focus on in-your-face (faux)machoism and sexuality? It feels like a very intentional choice, and while I will be honest and say that I personally find it annoying, I assume it was written into the show for a reason."
Legend Quest,What was it like workin wit people like arrow in players & how dif are roles like his vs other irl personalities that are playing themselves?
Legend Quest,"Maybe a bit premature but if you guys got a second season order for Players, would you stick with the League of Legends and the established characters or go the American Vandal route and cover a different esport altogether?"
Legend Quest,"Absolutely loved American Vandal - question: when writing the script, did you know where the story was heading from the get go, or did it change along the line?"
Legend Quest,How can I watch Players from Spain?
Legend Quest,Who was your favorite person in the writer's room and who was your most hated person?
Legend Quest,"Huge fan of y'all's work, and have been absolutely enthralled with Players so far. I especially wanted to give you praise for your avoiding making the fact that its gaming the punchline as it seems most media about Esports does. I felt y'all addressed that early and succinctly in a way that enables audiences unfamiliar with Esports in general to still feel engaged and move passed that hurdle.    


From an archival standpoint, I've been impressed with how y'all have utilized actual game footage. I'm certainly no expert on LoL specifically, but it is clear that all the game footage lines up with the commentary and jargon perfectly. I'm curious, did y'all get archival footage of games and write dialogue to match, or did y'all write the dialogue/commentary and then generate in-game moments to match what you have written?"
Legend Quest,"Thanks for doing this, Players is already one of my favorite shows ever made. As a huge fan of American Vandal AND LoL esports it was such a treat to see how well this show came out. 

With  Creamcheese, how hard was it to write a character who clearly has a ton of faults but still make them compelling and want to root for?"
Legend Quest,Do you have any strong opinions about any current or former LCS teams?
Legend Quest,"Thank you for creating such an entertaining show. I've loved every second of the show this far and can't wait to see more. The nightfall episode was by far my favorite episode with how well his story fleshed out and his character made me want to be a huge fan of him. 

What do you think Esport orgs and its players can try to do to sort of replicate the same sort of connection that your characters have with their fans? The closest media that the show reminded me of is Team Liquid's Breaking Point."
Legend Quest,"I've been a huge fan of American Vandal and didn't even know that Players was also your work until I recently looked at the wikipedia page (really pleasant surprise) but I had an extremely specific question:

When creating the ""fake games"" where clips were shown (such as >!Organizm v Guru!< botlane), was there anything you did to make it look more authentic? I know in one of the shots you can see a player giving themselves gold which has led me to this question."
Legend Quest,"Been following LCS and esports for a long time. I am not going to lie, initially I saw the trailer and was confused as to what a mockumentary is. But I gave it a shot and found myself pleasantly surprised at the quality of the show. I was hooked by the nostalgic feel as it reminds me of the old days where everyone had gaming houses and what not. Players is really freaking good and the jokes are top notch.

I’d have to ask though, what is your favorite player gamer tag both in lcs and the show? Thanks!"
Legend Quest,"I absolutely adored American Vandal. I certainly look forward to watching Players. I’d like to ask, did you two have a story in place for American Vandal season 3? It’s a shame Netflix let it go. It really was well done."
Legend Quest,"What's next on the horizon for you? Is a season 2 of Players something that you're interested in doing? If so, would it be an anthology series like Hard Knocks or All Or Nothing where each season is about a completely different team?

Loved American Vandal and am loving Players so far."
Legend Quest,How did you handle game capture and making sure it lined up with the storyline?
Legend Quest,"Y’all are both really hot, either of you single?"
Legend Quest,"i watched american vandal years ago (only season 1 though) it was fresh, seriously entertaining. different approach to same genre is good choice. i watched the pilot and planning to keep watching. i like your style on this genre. you re not directly making fun of e gamers, but its comical intensity makes my day. i hope it ends like american vandal. i hate cliffhangers."
Legend Quest,"I'm from France, where can I found youre LoL documentary?🙏🏻"
Legend Quest,Isn't LOL quite professional? If it's a mockumentary shouldn't it be like candy crush or something?
Legend Quest,do you have any projects you are excited about with season 1 of players being done?
Legend Quest,You're both really athletic-looking guys. Who's the better gamer/athlete/person between the two of you?
Legend Quest,Just want to say I am HUGE fan of American Vandal. It’s so fucking funny and deep at the same time despite its comedic tone. Did you guys feel like you were done with the show or was it a Netflix decision to not renew for a third season? It felt like you guys got even better in that second season!
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"When I saw the title I was really hoping Netflix was remaking BeastMaster, I used to love that show"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"**INFORMATION ON THE SHOW:**

The 10-episode event series will feature 108 competitors, 18 from each country, in total. Each hour-long episode will feature 12 competitors, two from each country, who will take their shot at running one of the most physically demanding obstacle courses ever devised, “The Beast.” At the end of each episode, a ‘Beastmaster’ will be crowned and in the final episode of the season, the nine individual winners from each episode will compete against each other for the chance for one contestant to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.

As previously announced, the hosts for each country are:

U.S.: Terry Crews (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” The Ridiculous Six), Charissa Thompson (Extra TV, Fox Sports)

Brazil: Anderson Silva (former UFC Middleweight Champion), Rafinha Bastos (Comedian, Journalist and TV Personality)

South Korea: Seo Kyung Suk (Actor, Comedian and TV Host), Park Kyeong Rim (Actress, Comedian and TV Host)

Mexico: Ines Sainz (Journalist, Sportscaster & TV Host), Luis Ernesto Franco (Actor and Producer)

Germany: Hans Sarpei (Former Soccer Player, TV Personality), Luke Mockridge (Comedian)

Japan: Sayaka Akimoto (Actress), Yuji Kondo (Sports Anchor)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I would love to see an obstacle course show without the added hours and hours of backstories and shitty commentary like American Ninja Warriror.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"No Dar. No animals. 

WTF kind of Beastmaster is this? "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is still better.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I can't believe i just experienced such a wide gamut of emotions. I really thought this was going to be some sort of SciFi awesomeness... you win again reality. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Looking forward to it! As a Sasuke (Ninja Warrior Japan) fan I'm looking forward to seeing how 2-Time Champion Yuuji Urushihara did! ♥
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Thought i was back in the 90's again for a second.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,/r/UltimateBeastmaster
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I thought there was a xenomorph when I saw the thumbnail
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Wow Sylvester, where did you get the crazy idea for an obstacle course show?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,That looked fucking stupid.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,This is like something you'd see on 30 Rock as a parody of a show. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Beastmaster TV show was my shit. I used to watch it along with Buffy, X-Files, Xena, and Hercules. Campy 90s goodness."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Same here, looks like Marc Singer is out of luck."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"didn't know it was a show, just saw the movie."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I was likely disappointed when American Ninja Warrior had nothing to do with Michael Dudikoff. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"12 competitors/hour sounds like an obstacle show without all the fluff. I'm in.

*...unless 2 compete at the same time*"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"> Ines Sainz

yoooo"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I wonder of Silva can run through the course himself. Pretty cool to see the GOAT outside of mma.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"so like the Original Ninja Warrior, or American Gladiator, or MXC?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Agreed.  Bonus that ATS built this (the builders of ANW).  Japan's 2-Time Champ competed in Team Japan for season 1!
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Without Kodo and Podo I am not watching.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Right you are Ken!
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,They don't
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Basically, yeah"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,They were the whole reason I got ferrets. Totally worth it.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,At least they dont devote too much time on backstories no one cares about.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I just wish they would let us listen to the foreign commentary since I'm outside the US and they only give you the local audio track 
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"The Get Down was popular with a totally different demographic than Bill Nye, than Marco Polo, than Sandler movies, than Fuller House... They don't give a fuck about quality. It's 100% about spreading out to people who didn't previously subscribe and who now do. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I don't think so, because they aren't trying to be a high quality brand, but a something for everyone brand, like you said. Hence everything from Trollhunters to Bloodline to Sense8.

They obviously want to dominate the market and having fewer but generally stronger products aimed at one specific group (people looking for high quality drama, whatever that means), probably won't work for that.
"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,You might hate them but people are apparently watching the fuck out of Fuller House and those Sandler flicks.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,I don't think Netflix has ever been synonymous with quality. Hemlock Grove was one of their earliest productions.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Netflix has had shitty shows for a long time. You just weren't hearing about them
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"People currently seem to give Netflix the  newcomer ""can do no wrong"". But if hbo or ABC puts out one crap show in a season they get hell. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"In a way, yes. I don't think they have the same quality control that HBO has. By quality control I don't mean completely interfering with a creator's vision, but sort of, using their expertise to help guide the show towards something good; maximize the probability that it'll be successful. Netflix, I think, is great in some ways -- like the way they use data to figure out on a surprisingly granular level what type of shows they want. But the downside is, I think their priority right now is to just to keep making new content that they know their audience is likely to watch. They have a certain number of hours they want to produce every year to meet their ultimate goal of having half of their library be Netflix originals. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I believe Fuller House is actually the most watch Netflix original worldwide. 

Anyway, I think ""everything for everybody"" is exactly the thing that works for them. It's what makes whole families stay subscribed non-stop cause everybody can find something to watch.

As for the prestige, with more and more original content, it won't be the so much the Netflix brand that will make you check something out, but the news that famous director x or academy award winning actress y is doing something for/with Netflix."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"No, because their goal was never to be HBO. They want a big market share, not to be a niche product. Fuller House and those Sandler movies are more watched than any prestige drama they have. Netflix is so big they have no need to choose what to specialize in, they can specialize in everything and you don't have to watch everything they put out just because it says it's an ""original."""
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I wish they would buy old shows. I fully believe they should have Mash, Beverly Hillbillys, Knight Rider, Threes Company, Golden Girls, and older cartoons/cartoons from the 90s, etc. Especially since they are putting more and more original content in the library."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,Netflix doesn't do prestige programming. Their model is to have something for everyone.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I think buying so many bad independent movies hurts their brand and customer base. Most subscribers would better watch a Sandler movie than a disappointing original movie (think The Discovery or many other recent ones).
Regarding the TV series, these need to be for every demographic and cover many international territories too. Half of the ones you mentioned I liked a lot, and probably there are many outside here that liked the other half just as much."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Netflix for a while now has dropped the ball on adding new and good quality videos. We have a Family Video store near my house which is exactly like block buster and I'm always looking at the older movies and going "" oh yeah this movie is great , they don't have this on netflix."" And I still don't know why I pay for it. They don't update their episodes either until like years later it seems. I'm thinking of truly droping them. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,They are like what major music labels used to be. Sure they will sign Britney Spears in a heartbeat. It's the bread and butter that affords them to expand their horizons and allow more risks. 
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Speaking only from experience I would agree with you.

The ""Netflix Original"" banner no longer means anything to me personally.
Maybe it was pure chance, but seeing that pop up used to be a ""seal of approval"" almost, and I could expect a solid show.
"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,The 13 episodes per season doesn't help either
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"The vast majority of Netflix originals are bad, even the majority of the TV shows Netflix has continued are just bad. Add to this that the streaming movie library is so much direct to video garbage.


But they do have enough great shows to keep me subscribed and the quality of the streaming and the UI are still top of the line and the gold standard. 
  "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Personally, yes. It's getting to the point where even if you WANT to keep up with all the shows, you can't do it. Netflix benefits from not having to program their shows within timeslots like cable TV channels. But the downside of that is that they're putting out too much volume with little controls. They keep releasing new shows every week, but are the new shows actually worth watching? Are they worth keeping alive? How many Netflix viewers actually finish every show? 

Say what you want about Hulu, but they've been pretty good about keeping their Exclusive originals lineup lean and manageable. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,You don't get what they're doing. At all. They were never HBO.  
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,there is no demographic for bill nye saves the world
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"That's interesting.  I can understand that.  

You're not likely to cancel a fairly inexpensive membership once you're on board, right?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Netflix isn't trying to be exclusively high-brow entertainment, but they certainly want to be viewed with the same level of respect as Amazon Prime, HBO, and FX. Otherwise they wouldn't keep trying to break into the Awards circuit."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Around the time Marvel announced their Netflix shows, Netflix was the golden boy of TV. House of Cards had just been nominated for a fuck ton of awards and Kevin Spacey made that speech saying that binging is the future of TV."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Well, HBO doesn't put out that many new shows. So a bad show sticks out like a sore thumb.

ABC puts out all kinds of crap. They almost don't even belong in the ""quality television"" discussion."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"A lot of it has to do with the way ABC/CW/etc. treat their shows.

Netflix appears to give the creators free reign over the show, which can be awesome or it can be bad. The other networks always have their fingers all over the show and you can tell because shows on the same network will have a lot of thematic similarities. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"You wouldn't consider House Of Cards or The Get Down to be ""prestige"" programming?  Or do you mean that they don't, as a brand, promise to do it across the board?"
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Yeah for every show like House of Cards or The Crown, there's Marco Polo, Fuller House, or Iron Fist."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,They sure as fuck wanted to be HBO.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,That's fair.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Yup, bounce rate. As long as people stay subscribed, they don't need to be thrilled. They just need to stay a member."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Their family comedies have been pretty good. Modern Family, Fresh Off The Boat, Real O'neals, Blackish are all high quality comedies."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I think it's more of a bad Netflix show can be shuffled into the unknown regions and never seen or discussed. But HBO is appointment viewing--you aren't missing it and if it sucks you're pissed, you wanted it to be good. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Netflix doesn't give the creators anything, they aren't involved in any of it. Netflix just buys content on the market. They don't make or do anything. Someone hands them a hard drive with the content. 

It is these companies like NBC, ABC, Sony making the Netflix shows "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"What does ""free rein"" mean exactly? Do you know that for a fact or just based on what you see?  I'm guessing that Netflix isn't just allowing producers to send in shows without their notes, but I guess I could be wrong?  Seems unlikely, though."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,The CW is basically just an extension of Netflix at this point though. As long as their shows remain globally popular on Netflix they tend to keep producing them. The CW seems to be one of the few traditional stations that understands in this new world of streaming that stuff like Nielsen isn't the only way to measure success.
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"I meant the latter, but I think the former is true too (in terms of quality)."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"They don't so prestige programming, exclusively. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"Right, that's exactly my point. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"That's not true.  They most certainly commission their own shows along with licensing others.  Granted, they all get the ""Netflix Original"" title, so that could be a little confusing."
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"A lot of show creators have publicly spoken about how Netflix basically allows them to do whatever they want. 

The only specific one I can think of right now is Tina Fey and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Apart from that I can't think of any others, though I do recall reading it about 3-4 of them.

I also think it shows in not only the type of shows that Netflix has but just the writing in general. "
Ultimate Beastmaster Brasil,"> The CW is basically just an extension of Netflix at this point though.

They put their shows on Netflix consistently = They are an extension of Netflix ?"
Ultimate Beastmaster,"When I saw the title I was really hoping Netflix was remaking BeastMaster, I used to love that show"
Ultimate Beastmaster,"**INFORMATION ON THE SHOW:**

The 10-episode event series will feature 108 competitors, 18 from each country, in total. Each hour-long episode will feature 12 competitors, two from each country, who will take their shot at running one of the most physically demanding obstacle courses ever devised, “The Beast.” At the end of each episode, a ‘Beastmaster’ will be crowned and in the final episode of the season, the nine individual winners from each episode will compete against each other for the chance for one contestant to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.

As previously announced, the hosts for each country are:

U.S.: Terry Crews (“Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” The Ridiculous Six), Charissa Thompson (Extra TV, Fox Sports)

Brazil: Anderson Silva (former UFC Middleweight Champion), Rafinha Bastos (Comedian, Journalist and TV Personality)

South Korea: Seo Kyung Suk (Actor, Comedian and TV Host), Park Kyeong Rim (Actress, Comedian and TV Host)

Mexico: Ines Sainz (Journalist, Sportscaster & TV Host), Luis Ernesto Franco (Actor and Producer)

Germany: Hans Sarpei (Former Soccer Player, TV Personality), Luke Mockridge (Comedian)

Japan: Sayaka Akimoto (Actress), Yuji Kondo (Sports Anchor)"
Ultimate Beastmaster,I would love to see an obstacle course show without the added hours and hours of backstories and shitty commentary like American Ninja Warriror.  
Ultimate Beastmaster,"No Dar. No animals. 

WTF kind of Beastmaster is this? "
Ultimate Beastmaster,Most Extreme Elimination Challenge is still better.
Ultimate Beastmaster,I can't believe i just experienced such a wide gamut of emotions. I really thought this was going to be some sort of SciFi awesomeness... you win again reality. 
Ultimate Beastmaster,Looking forward to it! As a Sasuke (Ninja Warrior Japan) fan I'm looking forward to seeing how 2-Time Champion Yuuji Urushihara did! ♥
Ultimate Beastmaster,Thought i was back in the 90's again for a second.
Ultimate Beastmaster,/r/UltimateBeastmaster
Ultimate Beastmaster,I thought there was a xenomorph when I saw the thumbnail
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Wow Sylvester, where did you get the crazy idea for an obstacle course show?"
Ultimate Beastmaster,That looked fucking stupid.
Ultimate Beastmaster,This is like something you'd see on 30 Rock as a parody of a show. 
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Beastmaster TV show was my shit. I used to watch it along with Buffy, X-Files, Xena, and Hercules. Campy 90s goodness."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Same here, looks like Marc Singer is out of luck."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"didn't know it was a show, just saw the movie."
Ultimate Beastmaster,I was likely disappointed when American Ninja Warrior had nothing to do with Michael Dudikoff. 
Ultimate Beastmaster,"12 competitors/hour sounds like an obstacle show without all the fluff. I'm in.

*...unless 2 compete at the same time*"
Ultimate Beastmaster,"> Ines Sainz

yoooo"
Ultimate Beastmaster,I wonder of Silva can run through the course himself. Pretty cool to see the GOAT outside of mma.
Ultimate Beastmaster,"so like the Original Ninja Warrior, or American Gladiator, or MXC?"
Ultimate Beastmaster,Agreed.  Bonus that ATS built this (the builders of ANW).  Japan's 2-Time Champ competed in Team Japan for season 1!
Ultimate Beastmaster,Without Kodo and Podo I am not watching.  
Ultimate Beastmaster,Right you are Ken!
Ultimate Beastmaster,They don't
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Basically, yeah"
Ultimate Beastmaster,They were the whole reason I got ferrets. Totally worth it.
Ultimate Beastmaster,Wait so no talking to animals or loincloth. Also Stone Cold Steve Austin already has a show that is just like this on CMT.
Ultimate Beastmaster,There is only one beastmaster and he doesn't run obstacle courses.
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Man, a reality competition show about finding someone who has the most magical power over other animals would've been really cool to watch. I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff, but it sounds more interesting to me than ""a bunch of athletic people run a a difficult obstacle course."" I like that they all compete in the end, but I was expecting a show about finding the best person to tame eagles or something."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"If Marc Singer isn't involved, I'm not interested."
Ultimate Beastmaster,">  I don't know what they'd do for challenges and stuff

Lions den, give each person a wolf pack and try to kill off the others. Put an owl and a hare in a place and have the competitors try and talk the owl down for the night. "
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Well, I know what cheesy sword-and-sorcery movie series I'm queuing up tonight."
Ultimate Beastmaster,At least they dont devote too much time on backstories no one cares about.
Ultimate Beastmaster,I just wish they would let us listen to the foreign commentary since I'm outside the US and they only give you the local audio track 
Ultimate Beastmaster,"I enjoyed watching the course, but I was a bit too distracted with the different announcers screaming as their countrymen performed.  I get that they're probably trying to build it up as some sort of international competition, but it just seemed a bit cheesy to me.  Maybe I'll watch the rest on mute."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"I just started watching this show last night and was really irritated that they were skipping parts of the course and contestant's runs not even 15 minutes into the show.  

Cool course though."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Do they ever change the course.  I only watched the first episode, but I saw that it was the same course for the second episode, and I wondered if maybe that's why they skipped so much.  How many times can a person running up a ramp be entertaining?

Still, yeah, it's crap.  So many rules.  Ninja Warrior is simple, either win or don't move on.  None of this ""You didn't get as far as this other guy but you hit a switch that he didn't, so you move on and he doesn't"" nonsense."
Ultimate Beastmaster,Your exact complaints are why I couldn't keep watching this show after the first episode.
Ultimate Beastmaster,"I get leading the audience to a false sense of ""This is the person who is going to make it to the end"" but holy hell we don't need 5 minutes of someone's life just to fill in because he fell off the second obstacle. "
Ultimate Beastmaster,I'd love to watch the Korean version I love the presenters when they're shown.
Ultimate Beastmaster,"You should search on netflix, there should be at least your local one plus the American version (it's just called Ultimate beastmaster, no country behind the title)"
Ultimate Beastmaster,"The course changes a couple of times. Like, minor course changes back and forth."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Past the third episode iirc it's your local presenters if you have them. I'm watching in Brazil and now it's just Rafinha and Anderson, with sometimes the others showing up "
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Yeah I found it. Thanks.

WTF is this? This is some amazon prime type of shit"
Ultimate Beastmaster,"I like it too, they did have some sob stories. But it didn't take up that much focus. 
They have also already shot season 2. "
Ultimate Beastmaster,"I watched the first episode, then realized I can save so much time by skipping directly to the final. I don't feel like I missed anything."
Ultimate Beastmaster,Bring in Yuuji Urushihara is awesome. 
Ultimate Beastmaster,Didn't know anything about this show and when I saw the title I though about the how awesome a series about the 80s beastmaster would be. I am severely disappointed.
Ultimate Beastmaster,So Ninja Warrior upped it's game or is this a legit new thing?
Ultimate Beastmaster,"It's brand new.  Same course builders, different everything else. "
Ultimate Beastmaster,The lack of Terry Crews is disappointing.
Ultimate Beastmaster,Agreed on the imbalances!!  
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Huh, title made me think I'd missed some type of reboot of the 80's movies about a guy that can talk to animals."
Ultimate Beastmaster,I hate the US announcers this season.
Ultimate Beastmaster,"The other hosts, especially the Korean ones, make the show. "
Ultimate Beastmaster,"Crews is a terrible commentator. He keeps saying the most generic, nothing patter. And he cheers for USA! USA! all the time.

I don't think it's a good fit for netflix -- you'd be bored senseless if you tried to binge watch it."
Ultimate Beastmaster,"I checked out a few episodes, it was silly fun. And looked hard as shit."
Ultimate Beastmaster,I was pretty sure the male host was going to commit a ritual sacrafice at one point.
Ultimate Beastmaster,"The Get Down was popular with a totally different demographic than Bill Nye, than Marco Polo, than Sandler movies, than Fuller House... They don't give a fuck about quality. It's 100% about spreading out to people who didn't previously subscribe and who now do. "

Talking Tom and Friends,"This show really missed the mark for me. Willow was a movie that Millennials grew up with but this was clearly geared to gen z who, I think, mostly don't care about the IP. Willow got sidelined as a character and the story felt like an incredibly generic YA fantasy plotline with Willow stamped on it. I had the same complaint about Wednesday but that at least kept the Tim Burton AF vibe through a lot of it, and who doesn't love Danny Elfman covering Metallica? Willow seemed to try too hard and then give up entirely. Watching Davis step back into the role was a treat but they... Fuck I'm not gonna say it.... Okay fuck it. They shortchanged him bad. And I say that with all respect to a living legend. His scenes, especially about his and Sorcha's history, were great. Everything else felt like Disney said ""How old could Millennials be? 10 years?"""
Talking Tom and Friends,"I tried to do some research into viewership, and it was obviously not particularly conclusive, but certainly pointing towards lower viewership then required for a sequel series if the show didn't pick up a lot more viewers in later works. The bad word of mouth/user ratings probably didn't help.

https://medium.com/@plumresearch/willow-on-disney-b702a8874c74#"
Talking Tom and Friends,"""Did he get EP?“

""He did.""

""Good for him!"""
Talking Tom and Friends,"I think they really missed the mark with casting, script, and music selection. So many ridiculous lines, delivery, and terrible covers broke the immersion constantly."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I liked the series enough. The one thing I didn't particularly care for, and I must be in the minority since I haven't seen it voiced elsewhere, was that it felt more of an ensemble, and that Willow was just a supporting character. I was really hoping for Warwick Davis to shine, and I think he can definitely carry a show."
Talking Tom and Friends,They never made a legitimate season 1.
Talking Tom and Friends,"If you didn't want to end up hemming and hawing about sequel possibilities, you should have made sure the people in charge had the property's legacy in mind when developing it, as opposed to their own personal checklist."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Man is a legend, and genuinely a nice guy. I noticed him while traveling through Italy and he actually greeted me!!!!"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I really enjoyed Willow. Here are the main things that bugged me: costumes were too modern, as was the language (including, but not limited to, swears). Most of all, though, was the modern music that ended most episodes and sometimes was played during the episodes proper. Why did the season end with “Money for Nothing”? Best I could figure was because, if there is a second season, the characters will find themselves in Dire Straits."
Talking Tom and Friends,If season 2 is more like episodes 6-8 than 1-5 I’m in.
Talking Tom and Friends,"Show sucks.  So.  Bad.

Could've been handled smartly, wasn't.  Shame."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Yeah I doubt it, even though they definitely aimed for at least another season or two.

* The show was weirdly paced, with some parts aiming to be slow paced while others are cut too quickly to compensate for list time. 

* The atmosphere jumps back and forth between being a YA CW show to a gritty fantasy. It's pretty odd jumping back and forth between characters making immature jokes and a plot significant character dying suddenly. I think we lost a third of the cast by EP 3 for... Dramatic impact? I barely even got attached to them.

* i'm not gonna pretend the original Willow was Shakespeare, but the dialogue was irritating in how modern it was. At least pretend you're in a fantasy setting.

* Every character quips like they're in a Joss Whedon production. At certain moments I'd beg the characters to STOP. TALKING.

* Story is for the most part predictable and dull.

* Character dynamics are forced. There's 0 chemistry between the cast, and Kit is the most insufferable, with Boorman taking second place for the most cliche quip-slinging scoundrel.

* Was it just me or Warwick Davis' didn't even try acting?"
Talking Tom and Friends,This show was… not good.
Talking Tom and Friends,I don't think it makes it to season 2.
Talking Tom and Friends,"If it actually gets renewed, please hire new writers."
Talking Tom and Friends,They had a sequel book series called shadow moon that honestly would have been a better path for them to take.
Talking Tom and Friends,"Being Gen X - I watched the Willow movie probably more than Star Wars New Hope. 

This show was not Willow - it was not the world of Willow. What was the scene with the 1800s frontier people all about? And don’t get me started on the trolls.

The show reeks of nepotism - Jonathan Kasdan does not have the talent of his father, nor the voice of his generation. Yet, time and again, he is given these huge projects because of his relation to his father.

I have little hope for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Maybe I would’ve enjoyed it more if it didn’t have the “Willow” label.

I laughed a bit and thought there were good moments. But it didn’t feed off the world the original movie built.

I’m all for growing audience awareness and presenting new opportunities for people to become a part of a treasured franchise - some traditions need breaking down, but this series tore down the original foundation the movie built that endeared us to it years ago.

I just can’t believe people signed off after reading the scripts - especially the first one - just bad."
Talking Tom and Friends,"It was … ok. Pretty trope-y YA stuff. Felt like they robbed pretty heavily from everything.  Multiple times it felt like Harry Potter meets LotR meets Fantasy Star Wars, but it was decent for what it was.  Would I ever re-watch or recommend though?  Nope."
Talking Tom and Friends,But it’s so awful
Talking Tom and Friends,"So did they finish the story arc, or is this something else I shouldn't start watching only to be disappointed in a cliffhanger"
Talking Tom and Friends,(Insert Arrested Development reference here)
Talking Tom and Friends,Won’t cry when they cancel it. It’s like the Disney Channel tried to re-imagine Game of Thrones.
Talking Tom and Friends,"I wanted so bad to love this series.  I will do anything to support Warwick Davis, as he's legitimately one of my favorite people on this damn planet.  I LOVE the Willow movie.  I love love love the movie.  I do not subscribe to any streaming services, so when the show was announced, I figured I would be buying Disney+ for a month to watch it, but I was able to watch the first episode at my mom's house.

The first ep is all Ive watched still.  I just couldn't really get  into it.  It didnt grab me like the movie.  It felt *too new* and too unfamiliar.  I still loved seeing Warwick, I still love him as an actor and I know it mustve been so special for him to play Willow again, but Im struggling to get into it and it makes me feel bad."
Talking Tom and Friends,I read that in the Arrested Development narrator's voice.
Talking Tom and Friends,I didn’t even make it past the first episode.
Talking Tom and Friends,"My kids and I loved it, started out a bit rough, but definitely got better. I hope it gets one more roll."
Talking Tom and Friends,I wouldn't bet on it.
Talking Tom and Friends,The story was ok but the dialogue was just awful. It was like watching a bad CW show
Talking Tom and Friends,"I say this as someone who grew up with the movie and still quotes it to this day with friends: this is a truly terrible series. Atrocious writing, editing, casting and acting. From the top down, this production is full of baffling decisions. I would not let Kasdan near another franchise."
Talking Tom and Friends,Let’s do a Legend series instead
Talking Tom and Friends,"Was a fun and funny show, felt like a good d&d campaign or something. I hope they get renewed."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Watched 2 episodes and gave up. The show sucked on so many levels, annoying characters with zero charisma. And how the hell is Davis not the main character. Movie is not that good to begin with, and the show just shat all over the nostalgia it had build up through the years"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I looked forward to this show so much. And I haven’t felt so betrayed since..the last time they revived a franchise Millenials and Xers and Boomers loved and just made it for what old people think Gen Z will like. Horrific writing, editing, production, everything. Why would you do this. We waited forty years and this is what you do? Why, why, why?"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I liked it, it was fun and didn't take itself seriously with some refreshing trope subversions. Would definitely watch a second and third season, as a show it's a nice palate cleanser fom all the other grimdark series."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I just finished it.

I thought it was a limited series.

I thought it was far better than Reddit indicated to me lol.

I was not a fan of the film and so enjoyed this more."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I was sooo disappointed by this series..

The terrible dialogue


The ""princess is a lesbian"" trope


The one good written character arc dying (to free princess from marriage obligations)


Willow just being mopey half the time

Me and wife loved the film and were giddy to see this show.. wife thinks they tried to force too much modern society into a fantasy story, and I just watched it to see if maybe it got better.. it didnt"
Talking Tom and Friends,"The show wasn't great, but it was decent in spots. I actually enjoyed the anachronistic needle drops everyone else seemed bothered by."
Talking Tom and Friends,I'm sure the hundreds of people watching will be eagerly awaiting a second season.
Talking Tom and Friends,Season 2? Most people have never seen episode two
Talking Tom and Friends,Please focus on editing and writing. I really liked some of the themes and visuals especially towards the end but new shows now have this amateurish feel to them.
Talking Tom and Friends,I dropped this series after episode five because it jumped the shark.  Episode five was beyond awful.
Talking Tom and Friends,This needs to be cancelled.
Talking Tom and Friends,I loved it. To be honest I only watched it after having a few on my day off and strictly as a comedy. But I liked it a lot.
Talking Tom and Friends,"""more story to tell"", there was barely any story in this season.
This show was just not good at all. Doesn't  feel anything like the original film."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Willow was extremely derivative and by-the-numbers 90s nostalgia pandering, and I loved every minute of it."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I was a bit irritated by the way they introduced the “Women aren’t accepted as fighters/knights,” thing. In OG Willow, Sorsha was a badass; they could easily have made the setting accepting of women warriors. This made a lot of the conflict in the first episode feel really contrived to me."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I named my kid after something in this amazing movie from my youth and now I am embarrassed because of the show.  I’m sorry kid, I guess I should have named you “Maze Runner Divergent.”"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I had such high hopes for this man, so much hope and then Disney pissed all over it.

Terrible costumes, terrible script, mind numbing dialogue, incoherent and utterly baffling story.

Fucking hell"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I liked it a lot, hope it gets a second season"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I was 5 when the movie came out and my dad watched it on VHS all the time, he loved that movie. I thought it was good, but was never a super fan. I went in having zero expectations and I enjoyed it - mostly for its comedy and it felt like a D&D campaign. I didn’t rewatch the movie beforehand so it’s probably been 15 years since I’ve seen the movie, but I did appreciate the cameos from the movie. There was definitely some random “wtf” moments - but overall I enjoyed it considering how low my expectations were. I feel like they were trying to capture the same kind of audience Netflix gets from Stranger Things."
Talking Tom and Friends,After watching episodes 1-2 I felt the need to watch it all the way through just to see if it could get worse and it did. Was really excited when I heard about the project but that show was bad.
Talking Tom and Friends,"I was looking forward to this the teaser interview with warrick and cast was funny but the show was a train wreck, tone was all over the place. The orginal was average back in the day but had its moments but this was cringy as hell. Still better that the rings of power snooze fest"
Talking Tom and Friends,"this show is very much like the witcher, were the main character has become a support character.  that said, i only watched 2 episodes then i bailed out, because the whole show looked like a bad cosplay. 

and the fun part is we all made fun of sony how they screwed up constantly, yet with the last of us they did everything right. stay close to the source material and let joel and ellie be the main cast.

it is really easy actually, give the fans what they want, instead coming up with your own imagination of how things should be."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Willow is trash, forget about it."
Talking Tom and Friends,Unfortunately the show is flaming hog wart dung
Talking Tom and Friends,"For me, Willow was quite atrocious. 

The acting, delivery, music choice. I literally only like 2 of the characters, I hated Willow himself with a passion and to me, his acting was incredibly subpar. There were a couple of scenes that I enjoyed, but I won’t shed a tear if the show doesn’t get renewed. It was overall quite bad."
Talking Tom and Friends,"It is a fun fantasy. An enjoyable mixture of action, romance and drama, with plenty of jokes. It seems like a three season arc is planned, if the Disney plus drops it, I would like to see it completed in comics or novels."
Talking Tom and Friends,Can't wait to see the new adventures of Strong Female Character and Ginger Plank of Wood..Riveting stuff!
Talking Tom and Friends,If there was ever a show that SHOULD be cancelled it’s Willow.
Talking Tom and Friends,"Willow is horrible. I hope fantasy/scifi shows like this keep failing, while more shows like Andor and HoTD succeed. Course correction is needed."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Willow was always a classic

couldn't stomach more then 3 episodes of that dog shit

wow"
Talking Tom and Friends,This was another huge misfire. Identity politics is all these people care about. They latch onto an existing IP like leeches and then bastardize it.
Talking Tom and Friends,this show needs to not be renewed.
Talking Tom and Friends,"To people who actually finish it, was it good?  I only made it to episode two and had to turn it off."
Talking Tom and Friends,The last two episodes of the first season were so bad that I don't feel like Season 2 anymore
Talking Tom and Friends,This was awful. Such a disappointment. I stopped watching. Shame
Talking Tom and Friends,Ron howard produced this fucking trash?
Talking Tom and Friends,"I loved the hell out of this show.
Willow was one of my childhood favorites, because it was so weird and wonky but fun and adventurous.
I still remember picking up sticks in high school and saying “uuuussse theee waaaaaand Willow!” to make people laugh. 
Hope it gets a second season."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I forgave everything about the series until Money for Nothing kicked in. Great song , terrible choice."
Talking Tom and Friends,I really disliked the first episodes and then someone told me to change the perspective. Since then I think of it as the attempt from a GM to run a Grimdark adventure and the players having other ideas. After that change I enjoyed it really
Talking Tom and Friends,"Hey Ron:  Maybe make season two of ""Willow"" be about *Willow*."
Talking Tom and Friends,Haha. Shoulda made a good show if you wanted to keep this job Ronnie.
Talking Tom and Friends,"I am sure that a majority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series genuinely didn’t like it based on their perception of its merits or lack there of

However I think it should be kept in mind that a large minority of the people saying that they didn’t like the series are saying that because a large part of the story was dedicated to a lesbian romance

Due to that one fact alone most conservative people are not going to like this series but few of them will come right out and admit that that is a reason for them not liking it"
Talking Tom and Friends,"There’s either a ton of shills or bots in this thread, I can’t quite figure out which."
Talking Tom and Friends,I really enjoyed the series. I rooted for the characters. It garnered my full attention.
Talking Tom and Friends,I saw the trailer & knew I would actively avoid it. Then I hear it’s obsessed with modern politics over story once it’s out & count my blessings I never wasted the time.  A damn shame as fond memories of the original.
Talking Tom and Friends,"The Wheel of Time, Lotr and now Willow. All terrible adaptations. We are truly living in the dark ages of fantasy genre on TV."
Talking Tom and Friends,"The show was trash.

Bunch of annoying brats."
Talking Tom and Friends,Narrator: There was no hope or plan but no one bothered to tell Gob .
Talking Tom and Friends,"A Willow TV show is a cool concept, but this tv show doesn’t meet expectations. The problem with the first season is that it shoe horns the distopian fantasy genre into Willow and it feels kinda hallow and lacks the worldbuilding the movie had. The film was also more of an epic fantasy."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I really get baffled when I see the critiques of this show on reddit. I had never seen the movie so I watched it before jumping into the show. If you saw the movie, you knew Willow was a bit of a misfit and the show itself is a band of misfits that both equally get themselves into and out of trouble through both their strengths and weaknesses. Do I think the pacing was off in some episodes? Absolutely. But the people basically expecting Disney Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones clearly never saw the movie and are just offering extreme critiques for the sake of offering extreme critiques."
Talking Tom and Friends,A no for me. Not after you convince the Former CEO to cancel the Owl House for this.
Talking Tom and Friends,"Shit, I better go watch it so they know I like it!"
Talking Tom and Friends,"The show was just ok, but it felt like it just wasn’t that great.  It felt like it was maybe catering to the wrong audience, instead of focusing on making a great show."
Talking Tom and Friends,"Is it bad if, at this point, if I see Erin Kellyman I just assume it's going to be bad? Not sure why, but she's basically an albatross for Disney shows and movies."
Talking Tom and Friends,Good luck with that Ron.
Talking Tom and Friends,I didn’t enjoy it at all. The writing was terrible and the acting subpar.
Talking Tom and Friends,"My favorite movie growing up and I watched every episode of the show. I can see why people don't like it because it has weird edits and abrupt plot stuff, but I don't think the show took itself too seriously so I didn't either."
Talking Tom and Friends,It’s an incredibly bad show. Shockingly poor.
Talking Tom and Friends,"Wow what a disgrace to your legacy to put your name attached to this project, Ron"
Talking Tom and Friends,Why are the heroes in today's series always women? Really boring. And unrealistic
Talking Tom and Friends,"I managed to watch the entirety of She Hulk so I thought hey, I can watch this, plus top bloke Warwick is always a bonus. nope, an absolute dumpster fire, left midway episode 4, shows where literally everything in it is shit are a sight to behold but even such a sight has its limits"
Talking Tom and Friends,"Fugghedaboutit. 

I bet the ratings are terrible right now and I hardly hear anyone praise it. Even those who ""kind of like it"" warn you it's boring and slow."
Talking Tom and Friends,"I hope not, a real disappointment"
Talking Tom and Friends,I definitely needed more LGBTQ drama in my Willow reboot
Talking Tom and Friends,"Hmmm... So i've been reading some of the responses here - I can totally see why people were a bit ""disappointed""  and maybe I have low expectations (For instance, I liked Rings of Power and hope to get more seasons of that)  

Willow, which I have not finished yet!  On episode... 7 - but Willow... Has been a bit of a rollercoaster.  Semi slow start, gets really dark and entertaining, but have some slow episodes in between.  The episode I'm watching now has taken me a few days to complete haha, but I enjoy it so far.  I want to see more.  I think there definitely can be improvements.  

I'm recommending it to everyone even though I know they'll never watch it, just like I did with Patriot (And now that show is canceled because of my stupid friends and coworkers not taking my advice to watch grrrrr)"
Talking Tom and Friends,"I hope not. This is the series literally no one wanted. It's so fucking bad.  Like dragon ball evolution and Velma bad.

Edit: You people's taste in entertainment scares me."
Talking Tom and Friends,Does he have COVID?
Talking Tom and Friends,I can't be the only one who doesn't give a shit about old 80's/90's re-hashes of barely popular movies. Let's get over this whole nostalgia phase and get some original content for once.
Talking Tom and Friends,Renew Willow and drop that garbage show they call national treasure.
Spark,"I'm not going to lie I'm very disappointed. From what I thought was going to be a very Classic series respecting the originals. Its a really hard to watch. It almost feels like I'm watching an adult version of a show that died. Adding children comedy and the joy of watching at all ages was an afterthought? It's like everyone died inside and had no Christmas spirit and everyone's just tired. Like the life was sucked out of the adults and th3 cgi and coloration with it. Like I don't understand how Tim Allen targeted a comedy series that's made for all ages to have adult politics. If there are children watching this show, I don't think it's appropriate that they're throwing in a political viewpoint. Nobpdy would give this show a problem with saying merry christmas. Im so dissapointed I was looking forward to this. Its almoat like adults cant seperate politics from creativity."
Spark,Should have focused the series on Judge Reinhold’s character from the originals treating patients that had run ins with Tim Allen’s Santa.
Spark,Was really shocked Bernard was a serial killer in this one. Not a good choice.
Spark,"After watching the first episode I’m disappointed. It sucks unfortunately. It’s not funny, acting is over the top, they threw politics in it, it’s just not good."
Spark,I watched 25 minutes and then ended up changing it to the first og movie instead. It was absolutely horrible.
Spark,[deleted]
Spark,"Not surprising. Hocus Pocus 2 lacked any sense of Halloween spirit, so it doesn't surprise me that Disney was lazy once again and just threw Tim Allen in a fat suit on some cheap set.

Say whatever you want about the original trilogy, but it had so much Christmas spirit in it (at least the second one did). To see it lacking here is a big disappointment."
Spark,Everything Disney does in 2020s is trash.
Spark,"My expectations are so damn low for this and I'm just happy to be back in this universe again. 

I'll probably enjoy it no matter what."
Spark,"I was looking forward to this. The first and second films were great, and I didn’t even mind the third one. 

It"
Spark,In one scene the kids spell SATAN for them to welcome. Then the letters are moved around and spells Santa. Super bad showing. Wouldn’t ever recommend. I have the Clip of the satan videos for those who care
Spark,"Ugh, Tim Allen's weird conservative values are shining through again. But this time as Santa. Now I get to watch 6 episodes of Santa complaining that things are too PC and the ""War on Christmas"" will get some actualized representation of some sort too, more than likely."
Spark,Tim Allen is a Trump supporter and an ill informed conservative. I hope this show fails and he’s gone from the lime light. I’m tired of bigots continuing to have a platform.
Spark,The acting in this show is atrocious.  How did the two married main elves get their jobs as actors.  The entire show is cringe followed by more cringe.  It tarnishes the legacy that the films created.
Spark,Just finished the 5th episode. I’m really enjoying the show and the humor.  ITT: weirdos obsessed with politics
Spark,Ok but who is gonna be the new santa!
Spark,[deleted]
Spark,I felt like that too. That it was too conservative. But in the very last episode he explained that it was his bad attitude for not trying harder during these changes and his own Christmas spirit was lacking. I thought the last episode made up for it.
Spark,That’s a great idea
Spark,"I was even shocked that he was a clone, and the OG Bernard died years ago."
Spark,Was he actually
Spark,"I’m the biggest fan of The Santa Clause trilogy (I watch all three every Christmas) so I was extremely hyped for this. All I can say is wow, I’m extremely disappointed. Too much politics like you said and it was just way too cringey. I will not be continuing the series"
Spark,"I felt the same way. Ended up watching episode 2 and it's better, but still not great."
Spark,Should have replaced him with Chris Evans.
Spark,Kinda kills the Christmas spirit when he flies his Trump flag on his sleigh and Rudolph uses a MAGA hat to guide the way.
Spark,Guess he will have to go back to dealing cocaine.
Spark,"
>It had so much Christmas spirit in it (at least the second one did). 

I might watch the other two depending on time and mood but ""The Santa Clause 2"" is always a Christmas tradition for me.  

Nazi Tim Allen Santa Claus just can't be beat!"
Spark,"Even the third movie, which was really stupid at parts, still had some charm and a nice monologue about materialism"
Spark,Hocus Pocus 2 was a huge hit for Disney tho.
Spark,Have you seen andor?
Spark,Hi. Yes please I would appreciate those videos.. I care. A LOT ✌🏽💚
Spark,[deleted]
Spark,"Lol, most celebrities with a platform are far leaning left. Stop worrying about peoples political leanings and you will be happier."
Spark,Tim Allen is an actor who reads from a script given to him. Disney and their show writers are all democrats and liberals. This show will fail because of democrat values they try and force on the audience. The constant failure of Disney and “woke” left leaning content is evidence of this.
Spark,"Wow that is so terrible of him, what would you say is the absolute most bigoted thing he's said or done if you had to pick just one?"
Spark,I’m sorry this is happening to you.
Spark,"God, it’s horrible. It’s really weird and hollow too. Phoned in writing, awful acting, and it’s not even a little funny."
Spark,Shuri
Spark,"Definitely not a white guy, that would be rayycist"
Spark,Probably Kumar
Spark,"What? You seem to miss my point, the point is you can tell he did that to judge millenials and threw in his own view point. No need to make a child acting as an elf to point that  out. Their clearly making fun of people respecting others and not judging people.That seems to be an issue to boomers. I understand the point of santa is a naughty and nice list. Nobody is saying you cant judge a child in a christmas movie anymore on whether their good or bad. But he clearly thinks you cant as he tried to show how stupid it is that you cant. By having the elves or one of them bring it up. The comedic tone is not the same as prior movies. You grow up. You clearly seem to miss the political aspects in the series. He makes fun of the people that made this movie priofitable/series to begin with. There are other examples in the series as well."
Spark,"It's not just Tim Allen's character and his lack of Christmas spirit. It's the entire setting. In the first episode you have a millennial saying that her entire life is judge Judy, an elf explaining that ""naughty"" is shaming and now it's ""misunderstood"", etc. completely separate from the character of Santa. It's like everything and everyone in the setting is a grab bag of right wing talking points. Super weird."
Spark,Would watch immediately if this were true.
Spark,"They have always been my favorite Christmas films, too. Hearing the political jokes was such a slap in the face. Like, oh, they clearly don't want my viewership."
Spark,You mean Chris Pratt?
Spark,"He was a mule, don't give him too much credit"
Spark,Agreed. Even though I hated the third movie it’s miles better than this trash.
Spark,Doesn't mean it's not complete rubbish. The general audience is brain dead.
Spark,"Any of the new Star Wars shows, tbh."
Spark,"Did you read the review?

>Here is a Santa who gripes that “Saying ‘Merry Christmas to all’ has suddenly become problematic,” and huffs at the idea that deeming a kid too naughty for presents is “brat-shaming.”

The first is a talking point of the right-wing ""War on Christmas"" narrative, and the second is obviously something a conservative Uncle would say when having to buy a present for all the nieces and nephews at the Christmas reunion."
Spark,"Have you seen it?  Tim Allen complains about not being able to say ""Merry Christmas"", the Elves don't want any kids to be labeled ""naughty,"" even if they do naughty things.  The replacement (non Tim Allen) Santa Clause is the CEO of a corporation, and even though he over-promised and under-delivered, it's not his fault for over-promising and under-delivering, but the media's fault for not having confidence that this CEO would do what's best for the world, setting up delivery centers 100 miles from every kid!  Yes, the hero of the new series is basically an analog for Amazon's CEO.  

And his kids are weird, but it's not Tim Allen's fault, he's a great dad, everybody says so!  It's just that his boy is a Zoomer that only cares about technology for some reason, and his girl is a zoomer who wants to rescue deers that are mistreated at tourist traps.  They only act like zoomers because they have no idea how the real world works.



The show is basically Conservative propaganda, and this propaganda is buried deep into its soul.  Which is weird because the previous three movies weren't political at all.  Most of Disney Plus's stuff avoids politics, even the show about the girl who grows up to be president went out of its way to avoid any sort of partisan politics.  

I'm not certain where you get this about making stuff up when anyone with a Disney Plus subscription can watch the first two episodes."
Spark,Tim Allen does a ton of his own content and is one of the executive producers of this show. These are his jokes and ideas
Spark,"Complaining about how saying Merry Christmas to everyone is seen as problematic now. Lots of people don't celebrate Christmas, and saying it to everyone all the time is incredibly dismissive of people from other cultures. That's why Happy Holidays is preferred, it delivers the same sentiment but is inclusive of all. Whining about that in this show just shows a lack of respect for others cultures."
Spark,"Hearing that this series includes politics completely turns me off from watching it. I’d much rather watch the rest of Disney’s recent film and television programming, where they take a thankfully politically neutral tone."
Spark,I honestly just felt like we were  meant to take it as Santa just being a grumpy old man now
Spark,About the only way they could make him hotter.
Spark,"It’s pretty clearly a lightyear joke, they mean Evans"
Spark,[deleted]
Spark,[deleted]
Spark,"Wow you unironically believe this show is ""conservative propaganda""... I mean wow 🤦‍♂️"
Spark,So you’re okay with shows and movies having an obvious left leaning bias but if the star of the show is right wing it’s now wrong to be political?
Spark,Wow he really sounds like one of the worst human beings on the planet...
Spark,"So as someone from a different culture who doesn't celebrate Christmas, I actually don't mind it when others wish me a Merry Christmas. 😊 I treat it as them wishing me well in general and I'll say it right back. But I also feel that way about people wishing me Happy Kwanzaa or Happy Hannukah/Chanukah and I'll wish them the same in return. My only ask is that if there's delicious food involved with whatever anyone is celebrating, that they share the food with me. 🤣 I prefer it when people don't just say happy holidays because I'd like to learn more about the actual holiday they celebrate. And again, I'd specifically like to learn more about the food aspect, or games haha."
Spark,I like the first 3 moviee. I might just stick with them. I do want to know how the santaclauses works. But I may just wait for the last epsiode to come out just to know. 😭
Spark,"nah, Chris Pratt is just the best actor in any medium so he should get more roles."
Spark,I am tho
Spark,"Bruh come on find a less cheesey way to argue. 

Those lines are clearly in the show and already speak volumes."
Spark,Have you seen the first two episodes?
Spark,"I don’t care actually really care what the political leanings are of either. It is not an either/or proposition and the world is more complicated than fitting people into “leftist” or “right wing” boxes like people constantly do. But Tim Allen’s stances are pretty clearly worn on his sleeve and this very clearly bleeds through in this particular show. “Millennial Kids these days” is a pretty tired old dude conservative platitude for example. Does it ruin the movie for me? Not really. But I definitely independently judge it as a dumb platitude being used within the show as I watch it. The point was to specifically counter stonee above…which is to say that the claim that Tim Allen’s views didn’t influence this movie just isn’t accurate. That’s specifically was what I responded to above. And it’s even more laughable to claim this movie is “woke” as some sort of counterpoint. Yeah, so woke Allen insisted that religion was explicitly put into it (yes, this happened and was not ever part of the original Santa Clauses).

Stonee above is apparently suffering from the current collective brain rot typical of many that just constantly fling the word” wOkE” around without any other context at basically anything they dislike. It has also fast become a pretty tired platitude with zero meaning anymore. A woman shows up and suddenly we are default back to WoKE, for example. And I would even typically agree that Hollywood has an issue with going too far with that type of activism."
Spark,It’s wrong to make a right leaning show because right wing political views are dumb and bad.
Spark,"I mean he also compared himself being a conservative actor to being a Jew in Nazi germany, too. So yeah he's got some pretty terrible opinions. I wouldn't say he's the ""worst person on the planet"" but if that's what you wanna call him I won't argue with you."
Spark,Just watched them last night
Spark,"Then... care to dispute anything I said?  Care to talk about the show?  If I'm wrong then I'm open to discourse, what have I said that is incorrect?"
Spark,"Anyone who genuinely believes Disney of all people would put out conservative propaganda, or that this movie is conservative propaganda, isn't rational or grounded in reality. This is an extreme example of an overly dichotomous and simplified world view to the point of parody. You're literally offended bc you were made fun of for being offended by everything. I don't believe any discourse with someone like you will be productive if you have a stance this comically absurd."
Spark,"LOL, so your answer is no, you can't dispute anything I said and you don't want to converse!  Cool.  

>Anyone who genuinely believes Disney of all people would put out conservative propaganda,

Disney literally [put out Propaganda during WWII,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney%27s_World_War_II_propaganda_production), creating such shorts as ""Der Fuher's face,"" ""Reason and Emotion,"" ""Education for Death, the making of a NAZI"" and ""Donald gets Drafted"".

> or that this movie is conservative propaganda,

Uhm... nobody here is talking about a movie.  What are you on about? Did you actually watch what is being discussed here?



>You're literally offended bc you were made fun of for being offended by everything.

LOL, Why do you think I'm offended?  I'm asking for discourse.  If you don't want to discourse, that's fine.  But I do find myself laughing at your posts, because when called out you reveal you don't know what you're talking about, and get so offended that you leave in a huff.  Discussion, talking, and sharing opinions is no reason to get so offended.  

Look, a new episode of The Santa Clauses came out recently, watch the latest episodes and we can talk about them, I'd be interested in hearing your take on them."
Spark,"My bad, *show*. Also it's not ww2, it's 2022... 😒"
Spark,"Yea thats what it is, your points are so big brained someone as ignorant as me simply can't argue against them and I am using you being unreasonable as a way out to avoid getting embarrassed by someone so smart. You got me, the reason I said I didn't want to engage with you is because your points are too strong and bulletproof to dispute 👍"
Spark,">Yea thats what it is, your points are so big brained someone as ignorant as me simply can't argue against them and I am using you being unreasonable as a way out to avoid getting embarrassed by someone so smart. You got me, the reason I said I didn't want to engage with you is because your points are too strong and bulletproof to dispute 👍

LOL, you're the one that said it, not me!  :-)  

But I do find it funny that you seem to be equating having a discussion with proving something wrong\right.  Media discussion and criticism is about understanding a piece of art, and various points aren't ""bulletproof"", but about discussing the meaning of the work.  

What is your take on ""The Santa Clauses"" if you disagree with my take so much?"
Spark,I knew immediately when I said that your take is too ridiculous to have a rational/productive discussion about that you would say it was bc I was upset/frustrated that I couldn't dispute what you were saying and was just throwing a tantrum and leaving since I'm not capable of discussing your brilliant points. Extremely predictable and almost thought of including it in my initial comment
Spark,"Saying this movie is right wing propaganda is objectively wrong, to the level of parody"
Spark,"Ok, cool, you're a psychic.  But **I want you to discuss ""The Santa Clauses"" miniseries**!  *I want to hear your take*!

Saying you predicted all my responses doesn't change the fact that you're still not a) either talking about your own position regarding ""The Santa Clauses"", and b) you're not disputing my take on ""The Santa Clauses"".  If I'm wrong, then show me.  I'm interested in hearing your take on the show.

But instead of either showing how my take is incorrect, or telling us your own take, you're calling me names, claiming responses and feelings that I don't have, and.... claiming that you knew my responses before I typed them.  Why don't you just either dispute my take, or tell your own take?  That's the purpose of this forum!"
Spark,"Who said any of the Santa Clause movies were ""Right Wing Propaganda""?"
Spark,"*show, idk why I keep calling it a movie"
Spark,"I think it's because The Santa Clause Movies aren't really propaganda of any type.  Maybe ""Christmas"" propaganda, if you sort of squint, in the 2nd movie the kid really does act terrible in the defense of Christmas.  But when you argue that ""the movies aren't Conservative propaganda,"" you're completely right!  And I agree with you regarding the movies!


But the series, at least the first two episodes, come off as blatant Conservative (not Right-Wing) propaganda.  No, the TV series isn't right-wing, it doesn't argue that Q-anon is real, the election was stolen, or other Far-right takes.  It's not right-wing propaganda.  But, as mentioned above, the series (not the movies) makes a Bezos\amazon analog the protagonist and takes several swipes at Zoomers, inclusion, and other progressive ideas.  It takes Conservative positions when no political positions are really needed or warranted in the series.  

I think you keep on saying ""movie"", because when you talk about the movies, you are completely correct!  But we aren't talking about the movies, but the miniseries."
Spark,"I am talking about the miniseries, I accidentally said movie. The fact that it (extremely lightly) mocks these ideologies does not by definition make it propaganda. By this logic many of Disney's recent  projects can be called progressive propaganda. While virtuous in nature, many of these concepts have been warped, executed or exploited in a way that many people find counterproductive or even ridiculous, often times by idealistic zoomers; that's what the movie very mildly and briefly mocked. Its like saying if you mock those idi0ts who glued themselves to paintings in the name of climate change then you're mocking the idea that climate change is bad or participating in anti-climate propaganda. 

Also, how can you say it attacks inclusiveness when there was clearly an intention to have an inclusive cast, the elves are multiracial (which doesnt even really make sense if you think about it) and santa was replaced by someone whos not a white male. And it is beyond a stretch to refer to bezos as a symbol of conservative ideology lol"
Spark,BTW I didn't like the show at all so I'm not here to defend it. Just think your take is way off
Spark,"So, what, they were trying to make their own version of [*Rescue Me*'s 'Sensitivity Training scene?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egAMgNY84do)"
Spark,This is embarrassing. They're upset over a racist character saying racist shit?!
Spark,">According to sources, it had to do with a writer’s recent draft of an outline for an upcoming Season 6 episode that included numerous uses of a racial slur by a racist character. I hear the script was assigned to a white writer, and the word in question was b—-r, a derogatory reference to people from Latino descent.

>The outline was met with shock and disbelief when shared with the writers room, and tensions grew to a point where the virtual room has been put on pause, sources said.

Sounds like they should go into comedy writing instead of their current gig.  This works as a literal comedy sketch. 

Its genuinely sad that people who are supposed to be capable of exploring mature themes can't even handle something being said/written in a perfectly legitimate context.  I just don't meet people like this often so its extra crazy to hear an account of everyone reacting to this worse than how most workplaces would handle someone calling a coworker a lazy bitch. 

Its not surprising given how much of a rat race this stuff can be in some orgs.  My local teachers union decided BIPOC people have their vote count as extra, this attitude really feels like some creepy cult sometimes and part of what makes it so weird is how basically no one marginalized is asking for this or thinks its address problems.

> It was to be attended by Jones, an organizational psychology consultant group specializing in fostering diversity and inclusion in work environments and leadership. 

These groups are nasty scams that take a legitimate issue and use it to validate insane levels of sensitivity and their paychecks."
Spark,Imagine if the writers room for Breaking Bad acted like this for the pilot episode when Hank says this.
Spark,Didn't they do an entire racial awareness arc a couple of years ago?
Spark,Totally living down to the caricatures Fox News puts out of the left.

Really? Are these writers in kindergarten?"
Spark,The entertainment industry needs to purge people who obstruct the creative process with all this nonsense.
Spark,"good lord, what a pathetic clown fair"
Spark,"This is embarrassing. All throughout my k-12 education in one of the most liberal parts of the country, teachers would have no problem reading racial slurs as they are written in books."
Spark,This is dumb.
Spark,"So is shit like this why Stormfront in The Boys was so hilariously ""Saturday Morning Cartoon"" with her behavior? Saying shit like ""You yellow bastard!"" because the writers were afraid to write down actual slurs?"
Spark,"I think Hank from breaking bad used to say the ""b word"" referring to Mexicans. I think the writer saw license to do so after that."
Spark,"Very woke show descends into predictable infighting just like every other woke project, more at 11.

It wasn't even a real meeting, it was a Zoom meeting lmafo. They almost had to *put it on pause!!!*

>The outline was met with shock and disbelief when shared with the writers room, and tensions grew to a point where the virtual room has been put on pause, sources said. Vernoff on Monday sent an email to the staff, a copy of which was obtained by Deadline, in which she spoke of “recent harm and systemic issues” that would be addressed in a Zoom meeting Tuesday. It was to be attended by Jones, an organizational psychology consultant group specializing in fostering diversity and inclusion in work environments and leadership.

Don't worry guys, we hired a consultant to do more Zoom meetings to ""address the harm"" caused by reading a word. And, no, not even *that* word. 🙄

How embarrassing. Imagine working somewhere like this."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"My kids love this show, and I can see why. It appeals to nearly all child demographics.

 It's got superheroes - with interesting powers. Not just the simple ""can fly,"" ""is super strong"" or any of the over done ones. They're original, and all work well as ensemble.

Plus the costumes are actually cool. From the simple main characters, to the occasional heroes and the absolutely bonkers villains.

And the good/evil struggle that the plot is based on its really intriguing. It really questions why people can be evil, or why they might do bad things. Chloe is a great example. An absolute horrible person, who does hero work? But then gets TURNED EVIL? It's so up and down and I love it.


But then high school -with the interesting mix of characters, all are still just young adults trying to figure out the world, trying to figure out who people are like all teenagers. These varied personalities, and varied alliances all blend well too.

Then there's the love story of the two that will never understand why they can't be together and all its soap opera glory. It's fucking magical.

Then there's just the basics. This show has a consistent tone, art style and discourse to make it just easy to watch. You can sink into it within seconds and hey absorbed.

And the music fucking rocks too


Okay I'm gonna stop. I like this site too"

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"I saw a few bits here and there when my nephews were watching it. It caught my attention and I ended up watching it on my own. It’s surprisingly good, yes! I recommend The Tick, if you haven’t seen it. Wholesome superhero show."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"It's a great show, I just wish it was more mature. Like it could benefit a lot from being aimed at a slightly older audience.

It's better after the first season, when we start getting more info on what's actually going on (very slowly learning the villain's actual motivation).

My only complaint is the god-awful Christmas episode. AWFUL songs, the lip flaps match even worse than usual. I love Christmas episodes AND musical episodes and jfc that one is just terrible.

Oh I guess I have a secondary complaint that the fandom is like... dumb? I mean because a lot of the fans are young, it's hard to have an actual discussion about the show because you can't understand what they're saying sometimes and sometimes they're just flatout incorrect (someone said one character's superhero persona being a male when her civilian identity is female is a reference to Mulan??? Like, dafuq?) Like I'm not out here trying to have gross discussions about 14 year old characters, it's just hard to have a good discussion about the show that doesn't feel like talking to a 4 year old."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"Agreed, it’s really good !"
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"It's not even a love triangle: it's a love *hexagon*: five corners. Count them: Adrien, Marinette, Chloe, Lila, and Kagami.

But still, very good words."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,It gets a lot less formulaic after the first season.
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"Yeah, it being kind of formularic *is* kind of the schtick, but there are in fact episodes where it gets kinda changed up. Like the episodes ""Gigantitan"", and, dare i say it, even ""Chameleon"". Might as well toss in ""Prime Queen"", because of batshit crazy it gets."

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"Not ""Chameleon"", but the two others are fine."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,I'll believe that when it's out. (eyes the last two reboots that were announced and never materialized.)
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Looking at her IMDB page it's insane how much I've heard her voice over the years but never knew who she was. She's definitely leaving some big shoes to fill.

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Rest In Peace. Thank you for the escape from reality when the childhood wasn’t the best. A hero giving other heroes a voice:)
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,She was amazing as Mayumi in AI Somnium Files
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,I never would've guessed Mimi and Cody had the same VA. Cody's voice was raspy and a little deep and Mimi's was the exact opposite. RIP. Such great talent.
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Voice actors can be in literally 100s of show and films and many people don’t know who they are or what they look like. I don’t think I’ve seen this actress before

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Sad day
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,One of my favorite roles of hers outside of Digimon was Kelly from 2001's Transformers: Robots in Disguise. Such a shame
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,o7
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Cause of death?
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,I just saw that she voiced Mayumi in AI: The Somnium Files. She did so well in that role; she did a great job voicing the character in a way that allowed for both goofiness and grounded drama.
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"She was great as Mimi and Cody, though I understand her career goes back much, much further than that."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Aw that’s so disappointing. As a rare fan of the Digimon Dub I really enjoyed Mimi and was happy to hear her in the Digimon Tri dub a few years ago when so many other voices had changed
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"It’s a shame when such a big voice actor passes away like this. Not all that old too, all things considered."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Also voiced the lady who tried to seduce and poison Mugen in Samurai Champloo

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"Was she Misao in the first Kenshin dub (Samurai X) or was she just in the Media Blasters version (the one that actually ended up airing on North American TV, whereas Samurai X is the English version that aired everywhere else an Eng version was shown)? Actually she might have been the same in both, it's been so long."

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,Damn. I thought that was Monica Lewinsky…
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"Yeah, she did so many voices. She did the voice of Goten in Super for one of the dub companies. She did the voice for the little brother character in kill la kill.

Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,"I'm astonished that the series even got a dub in the first place. A fair amount of jokes/gags in it are super Japanese, so props to the writers on that one. The narrator being completely self-aware to the point where he says that the show can't end or else he'll be unemployed and have to move back in with his parents where his mom will ridicule him for not being as successful as his brother Terry (who is a lawyer) still gets me.

I wonder if the license ever got rescued for another home video release. The original company that did it, Illumitoon, went out of business fairly quickly after only releasing three shows."
Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir,What were the Japanese smoking when they made that show?

Abstract: The Art of Design,"Looks really interesting, and probably completely funded on product placement"
Abstract: The Art of Design,Sounds an interesting programme but that was one of the worst trailers I've ever watched. For a show about style and design it completely lacked it. Why dramatic music? Why swearing? Why fast cuts? It's not James Bond or The X Factor.

Abstract: The Art of Design,"I'm hoping it will be like Chef's Table, beautiful cinematography and somehow making the chef/designer seem like the most interesting person in the world for those 40 minutes. "
Abstract: The Art of Design,How so?
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Yeah, they should have just shown the final project cinematically like they do with nature. This looks too pretentious to sit through.  

Also, that shoe is ugly."
Abstract: The Art of Design,Because the engineers are the people that have to tell these 'visionaries' that their 'creative' design would collapse/be unstable/kill someone.  Doesn't really fit with the theme.
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I don't think that's quite what they're going for. I can see an argument to be made for it but I think you may be thinking more of ""industrial designer"", which they don't mention but I hope they include. Closest things to it and engineering would probably be the automotive designer and the architect."

"
Abstract: The Art of Design,"For me, it looks like a giant advertisement starring people who think they're changing the world because they've designing shit like expensive shoes. "
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Thanks, I know what engineers do quite well. :-). None of the ""designed"" things in this exist without crucial contributions from, say,  mechanical engineers (autos), materials science eng (sneakers), civil eng (homes) etc etc. Engineering design is critical so it seems like an omission.  
"
Abstract: The Art of Design,I'd say that's more an example of marketing success than designer success. 
Abstract: The Art of Design,Advertisement for...? And it's a documentary on art. Making shoes is an art form no?
Abstract: The Art of Design,"The thing is they ARE changing the world. They are changing their little part of the world whether it is photography or shoe design. I don't understand why so many redditors are saying this is pretentious. 

They aren't the one making the documentary either. It's other designers (documentary makers) from Netflix taking interest and telling stories about these designers. This isn't driven by self-congratulatory motives. And to be honest, all of them are filthy rich from their art in very competitive fields because many other people like their art so surely they can be a least a little bit proud of themselves no? 

I mean, compare what they have done compared to the average viewer of a Netflix show like me and you. They have done something great with their job and passion. "
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Of course that's true but that's not the apparent scope of the series. It's about the design of the interaction those objects and systems have with people. Engineering is relevant to them in the sense that yes, it is part of all of the products, but it's not the part that's being studied here. The ""design"" in engineering isn't the type of design here. For example there is software design, being the application of certain programming/development patterns to software system, but that's not relevant to this. "
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Well it takes success in both arenas to really drive it to it's full potential. At the end of the day we're still just talking about a shoe. But fuck it, it's able to connect and ignite a deep emotional resonance in many people. Personally I think 99% of sneakers look like shit."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I don't disagree, marketing is especially effective in teenagers who've not enough time to think for them selves. Yet there is a reason these shoe makers chooses these designs over the 1000s of others available."
Abstract: The Art of Design,I'd say that's more of an example of a failed and blind consumer society. 
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Ah, that old fallacy. If the product is good people don't care. That's it. There are very few examples of extremely successful products that suck."
Abstract: The Art of Design,I'm not saying it is one. I'm just saying how I feel about it. I guess I don't really care about watching Michael Jordan talk about how he designed a shoe. I understand why some people would though.
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Right there with you, that's why I have a hard time taking this kind of material seriously. The architect is one thing, that's pretty cool. But putting a new color palette or some embroidery on something and calling it revolutionary or arranging plates on a table and calling it art seems fairly masturbatory to me. I like well designed products but this show seems like it's going to be a lot like Chef's Table, slick and well shot but functionally a modern version of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. I hate to use the term bourgeois but this shit is the definition of it."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Then it sounds like it's just not for you. I think many people, myself included, would be interested in how design shapes things we interact with on a daily basis. Of course some of the things in the show might be inaccessible to many but the concepts are still there."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"it does feel a bit ""now with 30% more"" being compared to greatness in this trailer.

It seems like all people ho have had successes that have involved large teams in the past and building the brand upon it.

Its very now, with how I see most people selling themselves on the internet. That brand sensationalizing, all while trying to keep an air of authenticity and ""person of the people"".

it feels really fucking bourgie as fuck, you're right."

Abstract: The Art of Design,"The New Yorker Illustrator and the stage designer were really good as well. The weakest ones were the ones about Platon, Ilse Crawford, and Ralph Gilles. The Gilles one especially fell flat because it was less about his design vision and more about his life story and brand loyalty. He seems like a talented and determined guy but the episode just came off as a long car commercial. The Platon felt like a parody. He's a passionate dude who's influence and importance is undisputed but it was really reaching at points. The Crawford one was my least favorite. They kept going on about how she revolutionized how interiors were approached and designed but it just came off as self-aggrandizing. The last bit about when you put humans first then you can change the world was just ridiculous. You design vacation cottages for fucks sake. I know nothing about interior design, so take that into account."

Abstract: The Art of Design,That one was the best I also liked the architecture one although I can see how people think the other ones are a little pretentious but that's just the high art way
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I know, right? I totally did not expect to be emotionally invested in shoes."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Hah yeah, the architecture one was fun too. Since watching it one of my friends and I always shout BJARKE INGELS in our best (or worst) Danish accents at each other when either of us sound too pretentious."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Ughhhh. I hate that shit. Yes, good design can be beneficial to the world, but let's face it, you aren't exactly saving lives or reinventing the wheel. It's a fun, rewarding career that let's you indulge your creativity and hopefully put a smile on people's faces. I don't know why they have to take themselves so damned serious. I always kind of regret never pursuing a creative career, but when I see the personalities and smugness of some of these design/architecture types it makes me wonder if I would have been able to speak their language and ultimately swim with them."
Abstract: The Art of Design,As a creative. Thanks for the rec. Will check it out!
Abstract: The Art of Design,"The music is great, I still sing songs from it, and my go to insult is his eyes are beady.  But I think it is so long lasting and special because of how well it fit the show. It wasn’t about the music it was about the characters expressing themselves, so every song is more memorable and meaningful."
Abstract: The Art of Design,Don't think any other series did a musical episode anywhere near as well even after all this time.
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Personally, I liked the song, “Walk Into the Fire” or whatever it is more, but yeah, that whole episode was fire"
Abstract: The Art of Design,BUNNIES AREN'T JUST CUTE LIKE EVERYBOOOODY SUPPOOOOSES
Abstract: The Art of Design,"[They got...the mustard...out!!!!!!](https://youtu.be/VCO0J1N661U)

But yeah, fun episode. [Going Through the Motions](https://youtu.be/FmLSjwam26E) sure hits harder as an adult. I must sing that to myself at least once every couple of weeks. Wish there was more love for the Xena musical episode that set off a bunch of these other musical episodes."
Abstract: The Art of Design,Dragon con does a “buffy” horror picture show live shadow cast with this episode each year and it is so much fun
Abstract: The Art of Design,"They wrote their own songs not covering popular songs of the time. The songs had meaning to the plot and while only three of them could sign well, that’s didn’t really matter.   It’s reveal of Buddy went to heaven and not he’ll when she died moved the plot along.  Musical episodes tend to have no meaning to the story but this one was important to it.   I still listen to the songs on Spotify every few months."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"This ""album"" from limewire had a chokehold on me as a kid."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Let me rest in peace is awesome, my fave song from this episode. The choreography alone."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"And then they did a throwback to it in season 7 with a new song for Anya, “I’ll be Mrs.” 

Mrs. Anya Lameass Made Up Maidenname Harris."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Funny! I still hear the ""I have a theory!"" song every time someone has an idea or a theory."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"""I can bring whole cities to ruin, and still have time to get a soft shoe in.""

I've always loved that rhyme"
Abstract: The Art of Design,"It was not only a fun musical but had also a shocking revelation at the end, which was the high point of this season. This was also the last episode where Whedon was heavily involved (he wrote the music and directed it) outside of directing the finale. Think of him what your will now, but after he ""left"" the show became very mediocre."
Abstract: The Art of Design,Xena did it first
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Just a PSA: Some editions of this episode are shorter than others. Be careful when purchasing it online. Make sure you're getting the full 50 minute version and not the 43 minute, TV edit."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"Yes, one thing the article didn't make clear was that unlike the *Psych*, *Scrubs* or *Flash* musical episodes (those are the only other ones mentioned that I've seen), the songs in ""Once More with Feeling"" continue (or finally expose) season-long subplots, like Buffy's feelings after being pulled out of Heaven, or Tara's concern about Willow's use of magic....not to mention having the lyrics sprinkled with Easter Eggs for the fans such as the mention of bunnies or Xander's curse from the Chumash Indians from ""Pangs"" (S04E08)"
Abstract: The Art of Design,There's always Galavant
Abstract: The Art of Design,What about the Magicians?
Abstract: The Art of Design,Scrubs
Abstract: The Art of Design,It seems like someone hasn't seen the musical episode of Todd and the Book of Pure Evil.
Abstract: The Art of Design,The Magicians did it twice
Abstract: The Art of Design,Its arguably the best song from an episode filled with greqt music. I always had a soft spot for 'Going Through the Motions '. 'Under Your Spell' is a great little ready ready pop song. And who can forget the [bunnies](https://youtu.be/YLMaSII_URU).
Abstract: The Art of Design,AND I WIL WAAALK THROUGH THE FIIIIRE
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I think they are talking about the episode which is also titled ""Once more with feeling"""
Abstract: The Art of Design,They’ve go them floppy ears and twitchy little noses
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I **love** ""She's not even half the girl she...ow""


Have you listened to the podcast Buffering the Vampire Slayer? It's from musician Jenny Owen Youngs and her ex-wife, Kristin Russo. She wrote a song for every single episode of Buffy."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I've been having a bad, bad day. Come on won't you put that pad away?

Those two throw away songs were great little cameos.

 Mustard guy was David Fury, and the parking ticket lady was Marti Noxon, both writers/producers on the show."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"‘So, you’re not staying then?’

Popping his out of the grave like the gopher at the end of Caddyshack. Perfect from James Marsters."
Abstract: The Art of Design,That song completely turned me around on the Spike/Buffy relationship.  All of a sudden he was undead Billy Idol and I got it.
Abstract: The Art of Design,"I Love Lucy did it first, in 1956"
Abstract: The Art of Design,I think this line is mostly filler.
Abstract: The Art of Design,In a well-written traditional musical (so excluding sung-through ones like Les Miserables and Hamilton) music numbers are used to express feelings and emotions that the characters couldn’t or wouldn’t express through words alone. Making that part of the actual conceit of the episode and its dramatic fallout was a stroke of brilliance.
Abstract: The Art of Design,But... It's guy love.. Between two guys.
Abstract: The Art of Design,If Galavant counts (which was amazing!) then I would like to make my vote for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Their musical numbers were amazing
Abstract: The Art of Design,"The Magicians had fun musical episodes (except the final one that just wasn’t good), and the cast had some really strong singers. That said, I have a hard time comparing because The Magicians didn’t use original songs, compared to musical episodes in shows like Buffy or Scrubs."
Abstract: The Art of Design,"My fave song from the episode is Xander and Anya’s “I’ll Never Tell” duet. So much fun.

Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Still remember this after all these years. It was a truly interesting idea/moment in the superhero world
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"This is from the series finale ""Destroyer"". Lex ex machina or not. This is one of the high points of the series & DCAU. I'm probably due for a rewatch on all this."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I've always felt this speech would have been a lot more powerful if he got more than 2 hits in before getting bodied.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"""always taking constant care not to break something""

\*proceeds to demolish city\*

😆

Jokes aside, it's a good speech and IMO Superman's most interesting aspect."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Justice League Unlimited was truly ahead of its time. It could have had so many more episodes, so many stories to tell, I absolutely loved the episodes revolving around other members like Huntress and Question, Black Canary and Green Arrow... I'm just thankful for what we got. 


As for this scene. I like how the world of cardboard speech was the writers' way of addressing fan complaints about how Superman jobs all the time in the show. It is a teensy bit unfortunate though that such a great scene and display of power is rendered moot by Darkseid literally just clicking on his utility belt and incapacitating superman with some weird net weapon."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Divx 🤓
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,i was so sad as a kid when they cancelled this
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Superman has a lot of great moments in this series. One of my favorites being when he fights both Brainiac and Darkseid(brainiac possess Darkseid I think?), and he's just dishing out the punishment on Darkseid.

Superman fights Captain Atom who uses Red Sun energy to weaken Superman. Superman had to hold back and still won.

Superman fights Doomsday in a Volcano while trying to contain the eruption at the same time so the Justice League can safely evacuate the locals. Even then Superman had to hold back so he didn't worsen the eruption.

Justice Lord Superman fights Doomsday before that Volcano fight, and he lobotomizes DD at the end.

Probably the most heartbreaking Superman moment is... oh there's two of them.

- Starro latches itself onto his chest and feeds him dreams of Krypton where he's a father taking care of his family. Then when he's free, he goes berserk on Mongul.

- He gets ""killed"" by Toyman but he's really sent into the distance future where he bumps into Vandal Savage. They help each other to return him home but at a major cost for Savage."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"About halfway through watching this series for the first time, really impressed with it so far. I think it might even be my favourite on screen version of the Justice League?"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"One of the best comic book content ever made. Certainly the best DC non comic content. The DCAU is also fantastic but this show just did everything right. It still baffles me how Warner brother just dont take a look what people loved so much about this version and try to somewhat replicate it, instead of the litteral trash they put into live action."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,It’s one of my favorite moments in all of comic book media.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Overrated
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Yeah, it was also a great way to handwave why Superman is relatively weak sometimes and even gets to weaker then weaker the enemy is.

He doesn't use most of his power most of the time, because that would just wreck shit. And going from that he probably uses too little rather than too much power unless there is something like Doomsday or Darkseid, because a little bit too much could turn people like Lex Luthor into goo.

Superman for most of his enemies is fighting awkwardly with one finger trying to not break them and stuff around them."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,It only the DCU could get it as right as this show
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"In defense of the Lex Ex Machina, Lex Luthor felt like a main character that last season and basically gets to achieve his goals of becoming god-like while going out on top while actually doing one of his only non-selfish actions to defeat an actual alien threat.  Though just suddenly bringing Metron in was rushed."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Is it just me, or is the voice acting not great?"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Right? Darksied isn't even all that phased and proceeds to body him with a handwave. The Season 2 opener for regular JL had a much more brilliant fight between them.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Man, I remember tuning into Toonami back in the day and just hearing the voice of Optimus Prime announce ""This time the league is UNLIMITED"".

It moved hard into the B and C heroes, and I never realized I needed those stories so much until after I saw them.  You could see the writers had so much more flexibility with Unlimited and it made for one of my all time favorite animations."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"I felt like it ended at the right time

The last season was basically fan service"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Only the real OGs know
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Ah takes me back to high school. Wait for new episodes of Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis to get uploaded to Stage6, download them, convert from DivX to MP4, dump on my iPod Nano 3rd gen and watch on the bus to/from school."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Xvid forever!
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I feel like this season was a victory lap anyway.  The prior season had the proper DCAU ending with Epilogue.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Spider-Man is the same, he constantly holds back against street level enemies. Not knowing this, when Doc Ock took over his body, he accidentally immediately broke Scorpion's jaw when fighting him."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"It was a truly epic masterpiece. Batman the Animated Series, Superman the Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Static Shock, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited, Batman Beyond, even The Zeta Project all contributed to the DC Animated Universe building blocks of artistry."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Gunn has mentioned both this and Young Justice as inspirations, so maybe there's hope."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Well, I believe this was Darkseid merged with some Brainiac tech due to Lex being betrayed by his girlfriend he abused and sacrificed."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Yeah the B and C heroes are the best part. There's a reason why I love that batfamily stories more than batman himself. I prefer seeing the lesser heroes and how they admire the original 7 as these near mythic figures  to  aspire to be like. And especially true about the flexibility line, when the powers aren't as broken it opens up the story much more. Not to mention all the new dynamics that can be created like booster gold, and then  there's existing relationships that were further explored like hawkgirl with flash and fire, shayera with Vixen and green lantern..."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,And still managed to have some of the best episodes of the entire show in it.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"""broke his jaw"" sort of undersells the punch. With a single swing he took scorpions jaw clean off. Scorpions jaw was no more. It is an ex-jaw.

Superior Spider-Man has some pretty fucking rad stuff. But the jaw punch is pretty goddamn stellar. The sudden realization of ""ohhh fuuuuuck"" that Ock has when he realizes Peter had been pulling his punches from day 1. 

My boys got an arm like a fuckin freight train."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"So many people shit on superior but goddamn Slott really 'got' both Parker and Ock in profound ways. Revealing the perspective of Parker's life from someone outside it both served to take the piss out of some of his character yet justify a lot more. In the end, Parker was revealed to be an even deeper character than people realized which is saying a lot because he was arguably Marvel's most iconic character at the time. Tom Holland's Spiderman benefits immensely from the exploration Slott gave the character."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,So what? It still heavily undercuts this epic speech. Good thing Lex Luthor was around to save his ass.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Which episodes?
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Patriot Act might be my favourite episode from that show, but the run from Flash and Substance through Ancient History is all top tier stuff."

Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Justice League and Justice League Unlimited has some of the best moments in all of comic book entertainment; wholesome ones like this included.  

I should probably rewatch both this month before they leave HBOMax on 1/31."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,The flash portion of this episode is also fantastic
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I love that Superman is trying to use his X-Ray vision to try to see his presents early.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,This is honestly the kind of Superman I want to see in the movies.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"One might think he went onto the roof to give the girl the joy of hearing Santa, but in reality he was just there cause she mentioned free cookies"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Comfort and Joy is a Christmas tradition. I adore how wholesome this segment is
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Why is he naked with the cat at the end?
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"J'onn J'onzz is very fond of what us earthlings refer to as ""cookies""."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,This show is leaving HBO max next month :(
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"If the DCU movie franchise is rebooted to be more like JLU. Then please...please do it right. It has so much potential. They just have to watch the animated shows to figure out what made it so successful.

Superman, Batman and JLU. They can build outward from there and it will be beautiful."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"The sheer brilliance of DC animated always makes me feel bad for how utterly mismanaged the DCEU was, they made edgelords make the films instead of people who actually knew the material. Here's hoping future DC films give us moments like this, give us the real Superman instead of what they wrote and made Cavill endure."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,This was beautiful
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,The Animated Series Superman is the best Superman.  There I said it.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I just rewatched last night. Fantastic
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,RDC World’s Christmas who wants to be a millionaire had this episode as a critical bit of knowledge
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Hello.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Love that episode
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,This is one of the best and most emotional episodes on tv
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Is lead ductile enough to make a foil out of to use in wrapping paper?
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I'm not crying.  You are.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Ma is high as hell right now
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Batman threatens the Martian with matchsticks, whereas Superman brings the Martian to meet his family to spend Christmas with. Such a goody-two-shoes."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Naked stroking a cat is the optimal way to do Christmas 🎄
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"IIRC the “lead-lined presents” thing is a callback to Superman: The Animated Series, where the Kents mention that they—I mean, Santa—did this so Clark couldn’t peek."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,What the fuck why would they be leaving HBO max
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Thanks for the heads up
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,[deleted]
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,The writing is spot on. I recall a few notable episodes like Grundy and Birdnose :(
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"I actually just started watching JL Unlimited and I'm really liking it. So many heroes in it, it's pretty cool... Bummer they're removing it, I just started getting into it.

Recently started reading comics after wanting to for so long"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Honestly... some of the best moments in television as a whole in my opinion. The Cadmus plotline was top tier writing, while the Thanagarian invasion was some blockbuster stuff. And the original series opening theme? I still get shivers when I listen to it."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Do you know how much of DC animation is leaving HBO Max?
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,DCAU’s Wally West is just the best in general. I love how goofy he is while also being undoubtedly the most caring individual of the group. Flash and Substance is one of my favorites for that exact reason (plus all the Easter eggs to his rogues gallery and history lol)
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Him and the Ultra-Humanite rebuilding the busted toy for the kids and the Ultra-Humanite touched that the Flash spends time with orphans on Christmas that he was willing to put aside his differences for them.

Then how Flash thanked him at the end for his help.

DCAU captured why people love these characters so damn much."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"""...*Flash.* It is **Christmas.""**"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Even better that his parents have probably been using lead wrapping paper for years. Or…totally not healthy.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"“Lead… *checks another present* Lead…”

It makes him more endearing. 

More when he insists that Santa brought the presents. 

Yes, he’s an alien raised the Kents, but damn it, Santa’s real to him!

(Though I wouldn’t be surprised if Santa was real in the comics. Just a good natured superhero wanting to spread cheer to everybody one day out of the year.)"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,He might have felt it first and then confirmed it.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Or how he literally jumped out of bed in the morning because he was excited for Christmas, Never change Clark!"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I just want to see a Superman that actually acts like a human rather than constantly being a figure so disconnected from humanity. No wonder nobody gave a fuck when he died at the end of the second DCEU movie.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Everything about the DCAU approached perfection for me. I think there’s something about the animated format that makes the DC properties work as well as Marvel does in live action.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"What, you don't like ol' Superman bringing the fight to Metropolis and killing who knows how many people while fighting Zodd?"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"""Hereafter"" from JL is one of the best Superman stories ever IMO. You get to see what he means to everyone else and his resiliance and spirit in one hour."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"DC gets animated and comics right much better than Marvel IMO. And up until the modern superhero craze, they were the only real game in town for live action as Batman and Superman movies were the only ones people really watched in the 80s and 90s. But it's a lot harder to put this kind of fluff into a movie over longer format shows like the cartoon, which had a runtime of like 14 hours."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"one of my favorite endings ever

""it requires a level twelve intellect to survive""

""im overqualified"""
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"And so began his addiction to Oreos, a storyline from the comics that would've been part of an episode of JLU (an episode paying tribute to Justice League International) but was cut at the last minute."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"He is in his natural form. Which didn't wear clothes since they can shape-shift their genitals when it is sexy time. 

And the cat rejected him earlier. Now it accepts him representing him feeling welcomed and comfortable. So he shares some of his culture with his singing on Christmas morning."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"He's actually always naked.  His ""clothing"" is just for appearances around others, it's actually part of his body.  He reverts his original state when alone or just around his cat."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"You can't judge another species like that , do you think it's inappropriate for the cat to be naked ? 

Martians don't need to wear clothes , he just does it to make humans around him comfortable"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,to relate to the cat
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Lmao! i just realized how it looks to somebody who doesn't know about J'onn, yes he's a nudist but he's ""our nudist""."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Gunn recently confirmed on Twitter that JLU and YJ are what the DCU is being modeled around. 

We won."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,James Gunn confirmed the DCU will be based on JLU and YJ
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Given that the Mythbusters used lead foil to make a lead balloon that floated, I'd say yes."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Because motherfucker Zaslav is saving a few bucks by removing it (rather than pay residuals).
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"Blame Zavlav. To make money, he's removing some shows from HBO Max and licencing them out to other streaming services so WBD gets extra money out of them that they otherwise wouldn't get from their own platform."
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Started a rewatch because of it.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,To sell to other streamers
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"""That's Lobo. L as in Lacerate. O as in obliterate. B as in disem-BOWEL. And O as in...well we can use obliterate twice right?"""
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"> I recall a few notable episodes like Grundy and Birdnose :(

Bro, why you gotta do this to me? :("
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,"At the moment it's Justice League, Justice League Unlimited and Batman: The Brave and the Bold"
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,I live when lex luthor swaps bodies with him and unmasks him only to realize he has no idea who Wally West is.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,Wish the flash had gotten a DCAU cartoon. His supporting cast and rogues gallery was big enough to support one.
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,This episode is such a wonderful Christmas homage. It makes you feel all the things a good Christmas story should have
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,They have. They say so earlier in the episode lol
Cyborg 009: Call of Justice,You mean Santa has been using lead wrapping paper?
You Me Her,"ok..... polyama-whatever the noun for the system is- seems difficult. all power to you if you can stabilize that shit but its like ""the black ops 3 realistic difficulty"" of relationships. THAT SHITS HARD ENOUGH AS IS. and props if you can find an equilibrium of that. but Jesus... i'm just confused as to why anyone even tries for that sort of thing. i mean open relationships seem easier than that ridiculousness..."
You Me Her,"I've been watching! I love it, its exactly the kind of topic a niche network can tackle. I've also been watching Almost There which is also surprisingly delightful."
You Me Her,Just watched all available episodes. It's really really great. Definitely my favorite new show this year so far.
You Me Her,Which one is Almost There? 
You Me Her,This past episode was perfectly awkwardly funny.  
You Me Her,"It comes on right after You Me Her. It stars Steven Pasquale as a psychiatrist who ""loses track"" literally of a girl he thinks is his soul mate. Throughout the series, sometimes she'll pop up in the background or they will just barely miss each other and it is hilarious."
You Me Her,"The show is a breath of fresh air and a guilty pleasure of mine, but there really is nothing to discuss :D"
You Me Her,"As a Canadian, it reeks of a show that exists because of Canadian tax credits.  "
You Me Her,[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/4grlb6/is_anyone_watching_you_me_her/) and [this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5xpf7x/is_anyone_watching_you_me_her/) are.
You Me Her,This looks like a thumbnail for a momsbangteens video.
You Me Her,"It was ok. I liked the Audience Network's other comedy, Almost There, better."
You Me Her,So ummm....I see 2 girls kissing here what's going on? 👀 should I watch this?
You Me Her,">should I watch this?

No. It's a sleaze fest."
You Me Her,Anyone watched the first episode of season 2 yet?
You Me Her,"Clarke:

>“No! Can you forgive me? It’s too weird. I’m so happy it’s happening. I’m over the moon about all the awards…I just can’t do it. It’s so weird. It’s so strange. It’s kind of like someone saying, ‘You want to go to this school reunion that’s not your year? Want to go to that school reunion?’ That’s how it feels. I’m avoiding it.”"
You Me Her,I watch your ancestors fuck
You Me Her,The analogy re: going to a school reunion that isn't your year is spot on.
You Me Her,"Makes sense. Once you make something, you don't find a lot of joy in watching it yourself. The illusion is shattered and it's hard to watch the show without thinking about the rest of the context. She'll never see the dragons as dragons, just green stuffed pillows and it'll be ridiculous to her."
You Me Her,"A very creative way to say ""please, enough with the Game of Thrones questions""

I love that universe, but the fans can be very assholes, always comparing actresses and putting their least favorites ones. And people scrutinize every answer the actors give."
You Me Her,I wouldn’t wanna see video of my great great grandparents having sex either.
You Me Her,"I'm sure she got triggered after GoT finale, very understandable."
You Me Her,I can forgive her because I literally could not care less.
You Me Her,We forgive you queen.
You Me Her,those eyebrows of hers -- 9th wonder of the world...
You Me Her,Poor Emilia is traumatized by what they did to Daenerys.
You Me Her,She just like me fr
You Me Her,Legitimately why is this a whole article?
You Me Her,It is mostly incest talk and dragons
You Me Her,Who's the redhead
You Me Her,"Makes sense, she made the show, its not like she had the same experience as us."
You Me Her,I can't believe how bad they fucked it up once they didn't have an actual plot to follow.
You Me Her,She ain’t missing much.
You Me Her,I’m right there with her! I only watched the premiere and then I dropped it. Haven’t watched a second since then.
You Me Her,This is code for everything from the second to last season on is garbage in comparison to what came before.
You Me Her,It’s trauma from the main show. I forgive her for what they did to her
You Me Her,"Cannot believe this show beat out Better Call Saul at the Emmys. It's a good show, for sure, but BCS is a masterpiece."
You Me Her,"Lol she is so animated in real life, I bet she would be great in Dreamworks cartoon if they took her likeness and voiceover."
You Me Her,Smart woman
You Me Her,It’s like asking the Saved By the Bell cast if they are watching Saved By the Bell: The New Class
You Me Her,"Same. But after the complete disappointment of the GoT finale, I can't invest in another one of these damn storylines. We all know how it ends."
You Me Her,10 hours of time she can’t get back. Show is absolute ass
You Me Her,She is so done with GOT.
You Me Her, It’s understandable
You Me Her,She is a smart woman.
You Me Her,The show about a family of incestuous dragon tamers’ drama is weird? Say whaaaat /s
You Me Her,Good for her. I couldn't get through the 1st ep. GOT is over for me.
You Me Her,Its almost as if being in the show doesn't automatically mean you're a fan.
You Me Her,"Emlia Clarke seems to be charming lovely person in interviews and a thoroughly indifferent actress, like a Bizarro Harrison Ford."
You Me Her,"Well I mean....I am not even gonna lie, if you asked me about her taste in media, I wouldn't even say that she watches fantasy shows just because she was on one. 

I think this might be code for her just not being interested in it in general."
You Me Her,I know how she feels. I refuse to watch the last three episodes of Game of Thrones. I’ve never seen them.
You Me Her,Who writes these fucking titles? Is re-reading that difficult?
You Me Her,S8 remake
You Me Her,Forgive? Why should we care what someone does or doesn’t watch
You Me Her,"Of course!  She won't watch it without me, she's saving it for our Netflix and Chill night

Any day now, any day..."
You Me Her,She's not missing much. No heroes or mystery. No reason to really care about all the petty sociopaths. No desire whatsoever to buy any merch.
You Me Her,"She's not missing much, I didn't even finish the season."
You Me Her,"Someone doesn't like the show that I do, or even just doesn't want to watch it.  So?  I'm an adult, I don't need everyone to be a carbon copy of me."
You Me Her,"Most actors don't even watch their own shows, much less the spinoffs they aren't even in."
You Me Her,Her platinum blonde hair and dark brown caterpillar eyebrows always threw me off enough to where it seemed too silly/unrealistic to watch. Who gives a shit.
You Me Her,"Variety.com
OP you must have a very boring life if you read that shit.

I couldn't fucking care less if Emilia didn't watch house of the dragon."
You Me Her,"She's got a point if we're being honest. House of the Dragon is a boring, badly performed mess."
You Me Her,Imagine sitting there and watching dragonshit when you could do something better with your time.
You Me Her,I think the new show is no threat to her legacy.  Not even in the ballpark. 😂
You Me Her,"Don’t waste your time, Em."
You Me Her,Is she watching The Last of Us?
You Me Her,cant blame her. hotd is shit.
You Me Her,"Me too, Emilia. Me too."
You Me Her,I don't blame her.
You Me Her,"what is there to forgive about? 

i also wish i had not seen house of dragon, but my girlfriend tricked me in saying it was good once the season was over. so i watched it afterwards. what a terrible mistake that was. it was like watching a reality tv show with housewives being pregnant. 

the only man in that movie, was that young kid who said i lost an eye but gained a dragon. other then that there was nothing bad ass about it.

Johnny Lawrence"
You Me Her,Being invited to another schools prom /homecoming. Familiar but different
You Me Her,"Im with her, but cause got ending put a poor taste in my mouth. So im gonna wait till its over to watch it"
You Me Her,What the fuck is house of the dragon?
You Me Her,She didn't miss anything. I stopped watching it myself halfway thru the 4th episode.
You Me Her,"She was always the worst part of GoT, especially early on. Not completely her fault, but her B story was awful."
You Me Her,Not going to lie.  Without Emila Clarke terrible acting.  The House of the Dragon is at least watchable.  Unlike the last couple of GOT seasons.
You Me Her,"I'm just waiting on the time travel plot where after Daemon does his thing to Aemon, he ends up 200 years in the future and hooks up with a resurrected Dany"
You Me Her,"Some of us couldn't even finish it Emilia, you don't require forgiveness"
You Me Her,"The poor woman's got PTSD from the GoT ending, no doubt. Why would she want to punish herself by re-entering that universe?

Incidentally, I liked Emilia in that movie where she works as an elf in a Christmas shop. She was so nice in that."
You Me Her,She's not ready to watch it unless she knows they ended it perfectly.
You Me Her,"Let's find a way to turn this into her complaining about season 8.

*Grabs the nearest phallus*"
You Me Her,"Show some respect, that's your family s history"
You Me Her,PTSD thanks to dumb and dumber
You Me Her,Yup! I’m with Clarke on this one.
You Me Her,"I don’t blame her for not wanting to get into a show that will likely set us up for another terrible finale down the road. 

We had to change the name of our Wi-Fi network after the GoT series finale."
You Me Her,">No! Can you [forgive me]?” Clarke said when asked about watching “House of the Dragon.” “It’s too weird. I’m so happy it’s happening. I’m over the moon about all the awards… I just can’t do it. It’s so weird. It’s so strange. It’s kind of like someone saying, ‘You want to go to this school reunion that’s not your year? Want to go to that school reunion?’ That’s how it feels. I’m avoiding it.”"
You Me Her,"If Emilia Clark wasn't one of the most charming adorable people IRL, I'd have a harder time forgiving her."
You Me Her,"I'm still not watching it, George."
You Me Her,"I won't watch it either, can I get attention for it?"
You Me Her,Ok?
You Me Her,The casting choices are weird
You Me Her,"I imagine it has to bring up a lot of weird grief. She had to spend a lot of time in Dany’s head and heart as an actress, being the last Targaryen with the last dragons. Seeing this series is almost a reminder of everything Dany’s lost; it’s everything she longed for. And then there’s how things ended for her… when you’re acting, your body can’t always tell the difference. She’s been through a lot to become the mother of dragons, etc. So, I don’t blame her for feeling weird about HotD, tbh. It makes sense."
You Me Her,Why is the title to this post written so poorly?
You Me Her,"what an absolute non-story, it must be a peaceful day on Earth today"
You Me Her,I can’t watch it either. I’m still too hurt from the last season of GoT.
You Me Her,It was terrible so she’s making a good choice. Episode 7 and on were pure pain to watch.
You Me Her,"She’ll only be known for that role, so not surprised she’s pretentious about it."
You Me Her,[deleted]
You Me Her,"I agree with her. While it is a good show well acted, it doesn't have the risque nor powerful characters GoT had."
You Me Her,"I don’t think she cares for GOT tbh, publicly she has to, I think she was done with it in season 2."
You Me Her,Damn that says loads. You only feel that way if you are embarrassed. It’s more like saying I choose not to go to this family reunion because I think half the family are conspiracy driven nut bags.
Santa Clarita Diet,Ok
Santa Clarita Diet,You understand the whole premise of the show is that sheila turned into a literal monster right?
Santa Clarita Diet,They reaaally should have given them a final season or even a lengthier special to end the thing. It just seems dumb to have unfinished projects in your library.
Santa Clarita Diet,I would also like to express my disappointment at the cancellation of this program
Santa Clarita Diet,Has Timothy  Olyphant ever been in a bad show? Love that guys as an actor ...
Santa Clarita Diet,I feel that way about Pushing Daisies and The Mick...
Santa Clarita Diet,"Totally agree.

And like some other people in this thread, cancelling shows like that makes me want to watch Netflix originals less. They never used to give us any indication how shows are doing, then at year 3 they kill em.

And I don't even care if they never plan to fund a 4th season. But let people know so they can give us an ending."
Santa Clarita Diet,Santa Clarita Diet and The OA are the shows that I'm most pissed were cancelled. Two huge cliffhangers for two really stellar shows. And they were cancelled 3 months apart. That really stung. Give a guy a chance to grieve ffs.
Santa Clarita Diet,So mad the adventures of Roy Eastman Kodak will never continue :(
Santa Clarita Diet,"Yeah I'll always be devastated it ended on a cliff hanger. But you are correct that there was a lot of development in 3 (?) seasons. Good perspective, when I think of it that way I think I'll really enjoy a rewatch."
Santa Clarita Diet,They could’ve taken some of the budget of flying Zac Efron around the world to say ‘Duuuuuuuuude’ at waterfalls and given then a 60 minute special to wrap it up at the very least.
Santa Clarita Diet,"It definitely needed a final season to wrap things up. It’s one of the shows that had little to no advertising, I didn’t know one other person at that time who watched it or knew what it was. It’s just lazy on the part of Netflix I think"
Santa Clarita Diet,yes justice for santa clarita diet!!
Santa Clarita Diet,"Every Deadwood fan standing right there with ya.

Makes you wonder: who's cornflakes did Timothy Oliphant piss in?"
Santa Clarita Diet,"It's up there for me alongside The Last Man On Earth. 

I need that closure, closure, closure."
Santa Clarita Diet,"I liked the first season a lot, the second season seemed to be very off-the-rails in a way that felt... very different to the first."
Santa Clarita Diet,"I loved Timothy Olyphant's response to the show being cancelled. He said ""I'm going to keep on coming in and doing scenes anyway. If they choose not to film it, that's on them."""
Santa Clarita Diet,"Yes- I upvoted all, but am too drunk to adequately express my profound disappointment- the story line was always interesting and the acting was top notch!"
Santa Clarita Diet,"Hell yeah, man. Fuck this shit."
Santa Clarita Diet,It's really short sighted of them as well because it damages their back catalogue. I never watched this show and probably never will because I know it doesn't get a proper resolution. If they tied it all up it means they have something of far greater value on their platform.
Santa Clarita Diet,"The acting was so good across the board. Also, I wish the show was well known enough for a ""this is what woozy boys do"" reaction GIF to gain traction on social media."
Santa Clarita Diet,"Great show. Timothy Olyphant played against his norm and it was hilarious. I was honestly shocked we didn’t get any closure. 

You should look up Better Off Ted. Same creator, similar humor."
Santa Clarita Diet,"I can tell you that the prolonged vomiting scene in the first episode turned off at least one viewer. And it’s reasonable to assume that quite a few others weren’t fans of that.

I’m sorry the show was canceled. I heard it was good."
Santa Clarita Diet,I felt the same way about Marco Polo. That show was amazing.
Santa Clarita Diet,"Such a great show, I am *haunted* by the cliffhanger ending!"
Santa Clarita Diet,Santa Clarita Diet was amazing. Honestly it was THE best role for Drew Barrymore. Like the ultimate role for her. She was so perfect for that character and I’m sad they cancelled it bc it made me love Drew Barrymore so much more again.
Santa Clarita Diet,"It wasn't funny at all, surprised it went as long as it did"
Santa Clarita Diet,"“What, don’t you want another season of 13 Reasons Why? Don't you want more average high-school dramas?”"
Santa Clarita Diet,Don't watch Firefly then.  But do....
Santa Clarita Diet,"I'll always be salty about Alpha House. It just kind of ended. No word of cancelation, etc. It just stopped being made after two seasons."
Santa Clarita Diet,"And after only 3 seasons.\*  

\*Cries in Firefly"
Santa Clarita Diet,I'm unwilling to invest into new Netflix shows anymore because of their cancellations. I'll watch old stuff again before their new Netflix originals anymore.
Santa Clarita Diet,"Can't agree. 

&#x200B;

I thought it was poor. I didn't get why people liked it so much."
Santa Clarita Diet,"The show felt like it wanted to be funny so bad, it wanted."
Santa Clarita Diet,that show was ass
Santa Clarita Diet,Netflix should stick to original movies or finishing projects. They are giving Lucifer a final season which I love but they killed some really good shows and since we can't see their viewer count we can't say why exactly.
Santa Clarita Diet,It was not a popular show and frankly did not display the qualities that you enjoyed about it. It was cancelled due to that.
Santa Clarita Diet,"TIL ""absolutely hilarious"" now means BORING."
Santa Clarita Diet,[deleted]
Santa Clarita Diet,"Even worse is, in Australia at least, Killjoys only has one season available. I could buy the box set on dvd."
Santa Clarita Diet,I'm a big fan of Olyphant but haven't seen this. Do you recommend it even tho it ends on a cliffhanger?
Santa Clarita Diet,SAME!!
Santa Clarita Diet,One of the reasons was Drew Barrymore wantes a year off with her baby.
Santa Clarita Diet,Damnation is another show with a cutoff ending on netflix
Santa Clarita Diet,I'm still mad about Firefly.
Santa Clarita Diet,i keep telling people how underrated it is!!! boooo on netflix
Santa Clarita Diet,Awww. I didnt know it was! How could it be cancelled? I've only heard people speak well of it.
Santa Clarita Diet,"This is the reason I don't watch many ""netflix made"" shows. I got sick and tired of getting into a show just to have it yanked away."
Santa Clarita Diet,I hate that I never get to find out what Mr. Ball Legs is going to do in Joel's head
Santa Clarita Diet,u/jacksamygdala
Santa Clarita Diet,"Boo hoo, my favorite got cancelled. How dare they."
Santa Clarita Diet,"I'll never stop being mad that Fox canceled ""the last man on earth"". Its the only show I've genuinely laughed at the last couple months."
Santa Clarita Diet,I would like to air my grievances of Netflix cancelling American Vandal.
Santa Clarita Diet,"It feels like every fucking Netflix show gets cancelled or shortened, I find It really annoying."
Santa Clarita Diet,Such a garbage show
Santa Clarita Diet,"To each their own, but I thought the show wasn't very good. Mostly due to the terribly bad acting from Berrymore."
Santa Clarita Diet,Recent memory. You dont watch much
Santa Clarita Diet,"Ugh. It's probably drew Barrymore. She's the absolute worst, and can't act worth a damn.
Also, the show was cringy, and downright awful."
Santa Clarita Diet,Holy fuck me and my wife randomly bring this up from time to time how they fucked the show over by canceling it. It was a great show and we were really upset when we saw it was canceled
Santa Clarita Diet,Netflix constantly cancels shows I love like the OA. I'll never get to see how the story played out and it ended on a huge cliffhanger.
Santa Clarita Diet,"I’m happy enough it ended where it did. It got pretty repetitive. Shiela and Joel make plans, Shiela ruins plan, they grow closer and learn to communicate better over cleaning up the mess. 

Repeat next episode"
Santa Clarita Diet,it bit off more than it could chew
Santa Clarita Diet,"Anyone who cancels a show and lets Timothy Olyphant, one of the best talents in the business, go are complete idiots."
Santa Clarita Diet,[deleted]
Santa Clarita Diet,Great show but the last 2 mins lost my interest in the direction they were planning on going so I'm glad it ended
Santa Clarita Diet,Haven’t watched it but I know the frustration of enjoying a show and Netflix dropping it out of nowhere. Love and Friends From College were like that. FFC was most frustrating because it ended at such a climax. At least Love concluded satisfactorily. But I’ll never forgive Netflix for cancelling FFC.
Santa Clarita Diet,"As someone who hasn't seen the show, is it worth starting while knowing it won't be finished?"
Santa Clarita Diet,Completely agree. It was such a fun and unique show. Why tf did it get cancelled.
Santa Clarita Diet,"This!!! I literally cried. What pissed me off most is these shows help people through tough times and cancelling them genuinely effects people mental health. 

I'm also never get over The OA, Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency and a handle of others"
Santa Clarita Diet,I'll never get over Craig Ferguson being canceled....
Santa Clarita Diet,Netflix - where shows become popular then get suicided.
Santa Clarita Diet,PREACH!!!!!
Santa Clarita Diet,"Yeah..,,,"
Santa Clarita Diet,"Ooh, thanks for reminding me. This one is on my next binge list!

I thought it was a chick flick/show, but I'm hearing good things."
Santa Clarita Diet,I loved it too
Santa Clarita Diet,I’m sad they didn’t tie loose ends of this show. I would be happy if they make one last season or at least a short movie to do it.
Santa Clarita Diet,We've all had that feeling for a show we really love. Don't worry the pain eventually starts to fade and nowadays a revival is a possibility as opposed to shows of the past.
Santa Clarita Diet,Everybody has a Serenity Valley.
Santa Clarita Diet,"It'd be great if they gave it a send off to wrap up that cliffhanger... It's all I want. Heck, I'd even take a zoom call series finale table read."
Santa Clarita Diet,"I’d rather netflix have 25 very big budget quality shows, that go for 6 - 15 seasons at least with all the focus on making the visuals/writing etc. as great as possible.

I now watch tv to get immersed like a thick book. If I need background stuff, i’ve got free to air.

If a book or movie was truncated before the final 90 pages or 90 minutes we’d scratch our heads. But tv? Sure."
Santa Clarita Diet,">Netflx cancelling shows out of nowhere 

Netflix seems to cancel most shows after 3 seasons, with very few exceptions. 

Costs go up the longer a show is on and because of the nature of Netflix and knowing that you enjoyed a show for dozens of hours, they're just going to suggest a newer, cheaper alternative."
Santa Clarita Diet,Same man. Every time I'm reminded I fume for like a solid five minutes.
Santa Clarita Diet,Such a fun show. Timothy Oliphant was hilarious
Santa Clarita Diet,Yeah that decision made me end my love affair with Netflix.
Santa Clarita Diet,"I enjoyed this show as well and looked forward to each new season. I still have moments of “I wonder when the next season is?” And then remember it was cancelled. It was a fun show unlike anything else being aired, and the characters were likeable with good performances. It was especially great to see Drew Barrymore.

What a shame."
Santa Clarita Diet,"That's the one with the Zombie Wife?  I watched a few episodes, and I was laughing through most of it.  But I found it a strange sense of humour   Why was it cancelled?"
Santa Clarita Diet,Having been through enough cancellations now I only tend to watch shows with 3 seasons behind them or that are based on a huge IP that is unlikely to fail. I’ve broken that rule on a few things that were meant to be one offs but I’m more annoyed at Netflix for dragging a season 2 out of things like Russian Doll now.
Santa Clarita Diet,Didn't care for the last season.
Santa Clarita Diet,what about the OA
Santa Clarita Diet,Me too! I didn't think I'd like this show that much but I ended up absolutely loving it! The characters were awesome and I so wish we could see more of them.
Santa Clarita Diet,Agreed. I don’t wNt to start a Netflix series unless I know it finished.
Santa Clarita Diet,"Just as they were starting to bring lore in and expand the universe and the characters were settling in as more than just sit com stereotypes as well!!
what a shame"
Santa Clarita Diet,God I loved this show. Still watch it.
Santa Clarita Diet,I don't understand why Netflix would do stuff like this. Okay so perhaps you don't want to have a full season more. You're Netflix! You can do what you want! At least frickin buy three more episodes to wrap up everything you mean shits!
Santa Clarita Diet,I think about it occasionally & still get SO MAD. I can’t believe nobody else picked it up for a final season - though idk how it works with a Netflix show as opposed to streaming services “saving” network shows.
Santa Clarita Diet,"I can see another network or streaming service picking this up soon and giving us more seasons. With so many streaming services they are lacking content to draw new subs in , a show like Santa Clarita could certainly help with that. That’s what I keep hoping anyway lol."
Santa Clarita Diet,"""I had such a good day at the asylum"""
Santa Clarita Diet,I’m assuming it just didn’t have the numbers they need to continue finding it. It sucks but a cult hit isn’t enough these days.
Santa Clarita Diet,"I could not agree more. The show was fantastic, though I preferred the earlier episodes. 

This is just ONE reason I despise Netflix. They are the shortsell of streaming. I actually joined (and won) a class-action against them in their mail-in days. 

Great company vision and terrible execution!"
Santa Clarita Diet,Sameeeeeee
Silver Spoon,This is good to know....15 years later.
Silver Spoon,"I'm so old I remember when Nick at Nite was stuff like I Love Lucy, My 3 Sons, Mr. Ed, Car 54 where are you (I think), Bewitched, I Dream of Jeannie, etc.

I wish TV Land had more varied programming, now it's just Roseanne, Everybody Loves Raymond and some Gunsmoke & Bonanza sprinkled in every single day."
Silver Spoon,"This is a pretty cool time capsule for what we as a society consider ""classic"" by the era. I'm interested to see how the lineup evolves. Thanks for sharing."
Silver Spoon,"Remember one hour syndication blocks? 2 episodes of a show, the. 2 episodes of another, and so on? The binging style ruined that. Now Nick at Nite is 5 hours of Friends, Comedy Central is 5 hours of The Office, TBS is 5 hours of The Big Bang Theory. The old way was so great, I loved getting to discover sitcoms that I had missed because they were in these syndication lineups."
Silver Spoon,It now has Spongebob I think which is weird.
Silver Spoon,lol a collector asked me to post this because she is obsessed with Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite.  will add more from the archives over time.
Silver Spoon,"Yes, that was in the 2000's. But before the 2000's it was only common to see two episodes in a row of a show on tv unless it was very, very popular and had lots of episodes. Usually it was just one episode, or they would replay the same episode again later (like Nick at Nite does).

But I did notice back then there were 2 episodes of Growing Pains each night (the same 2 episodes would be relayed during late night)....but Cosby Show was on 4 times in one night, but they were always the next episodes, so literally every 10 weeks they would cycle through all the episodes, it was very annoying!

The other thing was ""off the clock"" programing after 12am, they still do this now and their reasoning is is something does not start at :00 or :30 then viewers wont change the channel. But if they only have like 2 shows now it doesn't matter (10 episodes per night of Friends you said? That is ridiculous, and CHEAP)  But they only now have about half the ratings in 2022 than they had in 2007, so I don't think they want to spend money on new shows."
Silver Spoon,"Nick at Nite only has about half the viewers now than they had in 2007, so it does not surprised me they are using their own shows and putting them on during the night as well. They literally really only have 3-4 shows compared to 2007. Nobody wants to watch 5 hours of the same show, only to see those same episodes repeated 2 months later because they over played them. I think they are doing this so they don't have to spend money on other shows and can just show everything in marathons, but that is bad because you constantly see the same episodes every few weeks or months."
Silver Spoon,"It's a shame old episodes aren't reruns anymore. Nick at Nite exposed me to classic sitcoms that weren't always on streaming services, back in the late 90s even. I think given the rights of shows and music changing does play a role in that and certain shows are easy to shuffle."
Silver Spoon,I agree. Nick at Nite did the same for me as well by exposing me to old shows as well.

Silver Spoon,I think the [Welcome Back Kotter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVS3WNt7yRU) theme is still one of the best.

I'm night manager at an oceanfront resort, and will sing this badly and off-key into my walkie-talkie to try and lighten the mood sometimes. The desk agents think I'm a corny doofus, but the housekeepers and maintenance guys dig it and sing along with me =)"
Silver Spoon,"[The Littlest Hobo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFZKlfRrGbw)    
If you don't know the show (which you probably don't), listen to theme. Can't get it out of my head. I only know it because of Moone Boy (which has a [good theme too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZgYNI8OGDo))."

Silver Spoon,"If were talking about television music in general I would say [The Price Is Right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8iOmVd1W_g) theme has to be up there (I prefer the Moog version from the Moog Demo Reel the composer Edd Kalehoff made), next to the [1983 HBO Feature Presentation opening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1NKoMNy5bY). Then if we venture into News Music and such there are classic themes like the [2005 Weather Channel Storm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbxdyg5IvV0) Alert theme as well as [Hello News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQy7tvYMan8) that was made for stations across the country, then other TV themes like Friends and Seinfeld are good.

Edit: Incase anyone is interested here is the Moog verison http://clyp.it/xa0aeftz

You can't take the sky from me.

>One of the best documentary series I've ever  seen. I was amazed and enlightened about once every 4 minutes. Whoever you are, reading these words, watch this series.

>this dude turned the world into some kind of sim management game. we are all just faceless avatars to consume, consume, consume to people like this

-

>This series explains so much about why we're in the state we're in today.

-

>What blows my mind is that most people DON'T want to know this kind of information at all. It's like if you were robbing a bank and everybody just covered their eyes. Unreal

-

>This should be taught in ALL schools! People need to understand how they’re being manipulated and sold to...

-

>This should be required material for every person in the world to watch.  In the blinking of an eye, that programming would break down.  Eddie Bernays was an evil, greedy, self serving man.  I think his soul was terribly blackened by this one life.  We ARE responsible for what we manipulate others into doing, especially if we KNOW we are manipulating them.

>Dear Adam Curtis: I wish I could adequately tell you how much your work has changed my life - my thinking, my visions, my academic work.  I share your work with my students - and while some of it is beyond them (it is hard to know history when it is kept from you...) - the ways that you connect dots in space and time challenges them so much, they are almost always silent when the film ends.  This film is central to a transformation in the thinking of freshman and sophomores in my Social Psychology class - when we talk about How We come to Know our ""Selves""...and the attachments to STUFF that are not organic at all.  You inspire me so much - I admire this work - ALL of this life work you have done.  You are a diligent, vigilant, dedicated public servant, my friend.  Thank you for ALL of this.  Thank you for taking these risks and sharing these masterpieces with the world.  It is a better place because YOU are making in it!

The Sound of Your Heart,[deleted]
The Sound of Your Heart,"not completely? but not in ways they likely intended. the bbc has a long history of right-wing editorial stances, most notably in recent history having to do with trans issues, but the star power was always skewed the other way, so this didn't really come up. they're happy to keep platforming jk rowling and graham linehan to spout utter nonsense, because they were big(ish) names and raised a stink about being ""cancelled"" otherwise. now, suddenly the shoe is on the other foot and it's a problem? weird how that works out"

Just not in my top 10. Also explicitly excluded is The Simpsons (which would have been included if they'd stopped after season 7, but at this point they've sucked for almost four times as long as they were great).

The Sound of Your Heart,Please tell me you don't mean the Netflix House of Cards.
The Sound of Your Heart,What is Fleabag? I feel like I've heard of that before.
The Sound of Your Heart,Great list — a number of these would also be in mine
The Sound of Your Heart,"Not the sopranos and then you go pick some of the corniest shit ever seen on tv. I'll give you The Wire and Breaking Bad. But the Mary Tyler Moore show? Bobs Burgers? Monty? Freak's and Geeks? You think those are better than Better Call Saul, The Sopranos, Succession, Game of Thrones, It's always Sunny and Curb? No way"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Interesting then that The Wire and Breaking Bad are on most of the lists posted here, and yet you're literally the only person to mention Andor."
The Sound of Your Heart,Andor. The most boring Star Wars has ever been. They made a series about a character from a spin-off movie. Disney is clueless on what direction to go with Star Wars
The Sound of Your Heart,"Fuck. I forgot Twin Peaks.

Sorry Doctor Who. Hit the bricks."
The Sound of Your Heart,"It's a British comedy/drama written by & starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge. ""Fleabag"" is the main character and we never learn her name. The show is basically about her coming to terms with choices she's made in the past. Season 2 in particular is probably the best season of TV I've ever seen.  

There are only twelve half-hour episodes in total and it's on Prime so I would definitely recommend it."
The Sound of Your Heart,The Mary Tyler Moore show was absolutely groundbreaking. It's hilarious even today.
The Sound of Your Heart,Sorry our tastes differ. Thanks for the insults. Freaks doesn't have an apostrophe. Most of what you mention will disappear in a decade but Monty Python and Mary Tyler Moore will still be remembered as classics.
The Sound of Your Heart,Oops
The Sound of Your Heart,I am one of those who think Andor is overhyped and I cannot even finish half of it so you do not have to preach to me. I am just joking that the sub loves it so much they will put it as a top 10 greatest.
The Sound of Your Heart,[deleted]
The Sound of Your Heart,"You can never be too sure nowadays with how far standards and intelligence have dropped. Personally Andor mid, but mid is good for Disney Star Wars."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Ok. Now I know your opinion. I'd say Monty Python and Mary Tyler Moore are more legendary and will stand the test of time better. It seems very important to you to ridicule that opinion, so, whatever."
The Sound of Your Heart,[deleted]
The Sound of Your Heart,"It just seems like a dull conversation. You don't want to engage, just to strut about proclaiming your opinion is superior and mine is stupid. Duly noted. Bored now."
The Sound of Your Heart,"FX is the king of sleeper hits you wouldn’t have even considered   

I’ll give any of their shows a try at this point."
The Sound of Your Heart,Oh shit it’s Lip from Shameless. That guy’s a damn good actor. Definitely down for a watch.
The Sound of Your Heart,"We found that one of the reasons we felt such anxiety the whole season is that you would have a phone ringing in the background nonstop. Like god damn, someone get the phone!"
The Sound of Your Heart,"*Yes, chef*"
The Sound of Your Heart,"So, like working in a restaurant?"
The Sound of Your Heart,CORNER!!!
The Sound of Your Heart,"""69 all day, Chef!""

\*edit\* it clearly shows here I wrote ""chef"" but for reason it came out ""boss"" ...huh"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Carmy’s jacked. If he spends all his time and energy at the restaurant, how is he so jacked?"
The Sound of Your Heart,"Great show I binge watched it in one sitting. Jeremy Allen White is exceptional, I hope this gets him more roles. Matty Matheson is my hero and plays a great part."
The Sound of Your Heart,That ending had me in tears. >!Everything after he made the connection with Mikey and the sauce cans was some of the best TV I’ve seen in recent memory.!<
The Sound of Your Heart,"Let it RIP....You don't have to agree with me, but Jeremy Allen White's acting in scene where he talks about him and Mikey..is some of the BEST piece of acting I have ever seen"
The Sound of Your Heart,Agreed.   Episode 7 when the shit hit the fan ....reminded me  of my pharmacy when everyone wanted everything  at once. I left and finished the Episode in the other room .  This is almost like a less dysfunctional version of Shameless... another Jeremy Allen-White  program  that was on Showtime
The Sound of Your Heart,"This has been compared to Uncut Gems in terms of making the viewer uncomfortable and stressed. That was one of the first movies to incite that uneasiness in me. I'm not sure I am ready to do that to myself again.

*edit : After all your lovely comments I went and watched the first two episodes. Holy fuckballs. This show is absolutely fantastic. I.have no doubt the drama will be heavy as well when they get into the brothers death, but the pacing, acting and dialog are killer.

Thanks all for setting me straight! Might be my.second favorite show of 2022. I mean, Better Call Saul will always have my top prize. Although I am a bit biased because I got to film with Bob last year. Look for me in the Gene scenes in Ep 10, July 23rd ;)"
The Sound of Your Heart,"It's a great show, cousin."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Definitely one of the best things to come out this year. Short and sweet, they knew what they wanted to do and did it."
The Sound of Your Heart,Episode 7 gave me the only panic attack in my life that I actually enjoyed. Felt so real.
The Sound of Your Heart,"Its a really great show but I couldn't watch it.

Its like the other great show on FX is the old man, and that's like secret agent stressful, the Bear is like my shitty job stressful I can't deal. 

Great show, not for me."
The Sound of Your Heart,Brought back so much stress and latent PTSD from my line cook days. Love it. Favorite new show.
The Sound of Your Heart,My favorite thing is Hulu promotes the show as a comedy.
The Sound of Your Heart,"Ok, I thought it was just me and my anxiety issues that made this so stressful to watch.  I had to get up and pace because I almost couldn’t handle it.  I hung in there because Jeremy Allen White is SO FUCKING GOOD.  That monologue in the last episode.  Jesus Christ.  I’ve been thinking about it for days."
The Sound of Your Heart,"For anyone who likes The Bear, I recommend a recent Stephen Graham film called Boiling Point.It follows the same 'nightmare day at work' feel in a restaurant, and is entirely done in one take."
The Sound of Your Heart,Lip just can’t get out of Chicago.
The Sound of Your Heart,Did anyone else get boyfriend vibes from Marcus and his roommate Chester? I feel like they are more than just friends
The Sound of Your Heart,"Wife and I binged the whole show on Sunday, it's great"
The Sound of Your Heart,Heard.
The Sound of Your Heart,"“Any of you incel, Q-anon, 4chan, Snyder cut motherfuckers wanna get out of line now?!?”"
The Sound of Your Heart,This show gives me anxiety. It's somehow fantastic lol
The Sound of Your Heart,"Great show, but I don't get the ""cousin"" thing. I've never heard people call each other cousin like that. Is that a Chicago thing?"
The Sound of Your Heart,"As someone who has worked in restaurants for 10+ years, this is the closest a show has ever gotten to accurately depict what it’s like to be in the kitchen. Plus, Ayo Edebiri is a fucking star."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Episode 7 “the review” is the most amazing, loud, weird, and emotional and thought provoking episode on current tv. 
Highly recommended!"
The Sound of Your Heart,"It’s really quite a show.

I worked for a chef recently who came from the 3* world and the personality similarity is shocking. It really captures the feeling of some different parts of restaurant service amazingly, though there are some details that aren’t *quite* right.

I also lost my best friend 18 months ago and those notes have resonated pretty highly with me, I’ve cried a few times in the first two episodes."
The Sound of Your Heart,This show is well done but I had to bail because it’s just so anxiety inducing to watch
The Sound of Your Heart,"One of the best shows anywhere right now. Just a great show that really gets your heart rate up. Totally know this family, totally understand the dynamics. Totally gets the work place. It's just too real that's what makes it so good. The writers, producers and directors need to be given a fuck ton on money."
The Sound of Your Heart,Episode 7 was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time.
The Sound of Your Heart,How does it compare to films like Boiling Point.
The Sound of Your Heart,Just wrapped it up in 3 days…it is genuine and an adrenaline ride. Loved it and would highly recommend!!!
The Sound of Your Heart,This show is really good! Have 1 more episode to go.
The Sound of Your Heart,"Man, I really tried to watch it.  The conflict is too stressful for me.  I don't understand why, as the rightful owner of the restaurant, he didn't threaten to fire all those disrespectful chucklefucks halfway through the first day.  Instead he just kept screaming ""Please!  Please!"" all the time.

When I correctly predicted some mobster type would show up to shake him down, because no way they wouldn't take the opportunity to add to the drama, I decided it's not for me."
The Sound of Your Heart,Still waiting to watch it in Canada
The Sound of Your Heart,"Unless you’re in canada and can’t watch it, even though it was advertised that you’d be able to."
The Sound of Your Heart,This is not the first time I’ve seen this exact post title posted on Reddit. This is a paid spam/shill account.
The Sound of Your Heart,Article is almost unreadable due to the constant movement of the text as more and more ads get pumped onto the page. What a disaster.
The Sound of Your Heart,I want to give this show a try but I'm worried it's just misery porn.  Does it have levity and humanity or does it just leave you feeling bad?
The Sound of Your Heart,"I’ve watched a few episodes and the acting has been terrific, but I’m trying to figure out the point? Like… what’s the arc?  This might be like Mad Men. Everyone loves it, but nothing ever really happens."
The Sound of Your Heart,"Yeah I'm not sure who binged this. They're either stronger than me, or have never worked BOH."
The Sound of Your Heart,"This is funny bc my friend and I started watching it this weekend and 5 minutes in I said, “This is giving me anxiety, I can’t watch it.” I just had to up my Lexapro. I’ll give it a whirl after it kicks in."
The Sound of Your Heart,"I’m 5 episodes in. 7.5/10 for me so far, it’s good not great. Maybe that opinion will change by the end"
The Sound of Your Heart,I know what you mean. I really enjoy it but I’m tired after watching. It’s really intense.
The Sound of Your Heart,"If you love the character [Neil Fak (Matty Matheson)](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8274309/) do yourself a favour and check out his show ‘Just a Dash’ on YouTube. It’s his hilarious and surreal cooking show that demands to be seen.

The Sound of Your Heart,Watched it in 2 days. I want 50 more episodes.
The Sound of Your Heart,"It’s a great show. We’ll written and superbly acted. But I really have to give the entire crew props for their long camera shots and one shots. 

There are some really long scenes in this show without camera edits or cuts, whether it’s focusing on one character doing a several minute monologue, or in one case they do a 10-15 minute one shot following various characters around during the chaos of a dinner service, all in one take. From a technical perspective it is incredible to watch."
The Sound of Your Heart,Is this an ad?
Riverdale,The actors are shedding tears of joy right now because they’re finally free.
Riverdale,There goes Alex Meyers' youtube channel
Riverdale,"May the person who made this decision never find out the triumphs and defeats, the epic highs and lows of high school football :("
Riverdale,"I will be quite surprised if any series on The CW continues for more than one additional season. The network, at least as it's existed up to this point, is going to cease to be."
Riverdale,I'm kinda sad. It's fun to come across random comments on Reddit from people who tell us about the new crazy stuff that's happening in the show.
Riverdale,I heard they got super powers or something.  Honestly I dropped the show during the first season.
Riverdale,"Mark Pedowitz: 
> “I am a big believer in attempting to give series that have had long runs an appropriate sendoff,”

Mate you literally cancelled Legends of Tomorrow after 7 seasons without giving it a (shorter) final run to wrap things up."
Riverdale,The actors must be so relieved.
Riverdale,[deleted]
Riverdale,Will the CW still be in the scripted programming game in five years? They have almost nothing left.
Riverdale,CW writers room finally ran out of cocaine?
Riverdale,“Cancelled” is a weird term to use for a show that’s being given a known opportunity to have a final season to wrap itself up.
Riverdale,"Finally, THEY'RE FREE!!! 😂"
Riverdale,"“I dropped outta school to run drugs to support my nanna!”
-an actual person wrote that"
Riverdale,Does TV Line know the difference between a cancellation and a finished run?
Riverdale,"They should fund and produce that new live action scooby doo that just posted their pilot on YouTube. 

I genuinely enjoyed that. It had enough references and fan service for scooby fans to make me want a full season!"
Riverdale,"If this series doesn't end in a two-part event of each of them being taken down by a Predator*, what was this all even for? 

*The alien warrior, not Ms Grundy."
Riverdale,They should do an animated show for HBO Max as the next Archie thing. Something light-hearted and fun.
Riverdale,"It’s not canceled, it’s just ending. Why does it seem that no one can tell the difference?"
Riverdale,I’m shocked it lasted 7 seasons. Season 1 was fine but I gave up in season 2 and I haven’t heard of anyone actually watching the show at this point.
Riverdale,"This show is terrible, but I love it. I'll have to find another show to fill the void I guess."
Riverdale,I hope they go absolutely batshit crazy for the final season. Like more than usual.
Riverdale,(hoping for an appearance by John Bernthal in the final season)
Riverdale,I lost track. Were we still pretending they were all teenagers?
Riverdale,It's not really cancelled if they are giving it a final season...
Riverdale,"I have never watched Riverdale and I still felt a drop in my stomach.

I'm just happy knowing it exists and hearing the outlandish plot lines."
Riverdale,I lost interest when they constantly started pretending like it was 1930.
Riverdale,That's not what cancelled means. Its likely ending because the actors' 7-year contracts are up and no-one wants to renew. Its a natural ending. Not a cancellation.
Riverdale,"It's kinda sad, because Riverdale Season 1 was great, not perfect, but was a great teenage murder drama. It got everything, pace was fine as it was 12 episodes, characters development was cunkly but they were likeable, sorta, everything  paid off in the finale and that was it.

Then Season 2 came around and it was so fucking awful that I stopped mid season, I just know what's going on via Alex Meyer's youtube channel. The fact that it went from a ""serious"" scooby doo type of drama with likeable characters to secret kids being actually murders, being in the mafia as a teeneger, going to prison, figthing a bear, witches, and now superpowers just shows that the CW doesn't have good writers."
Riverdale,Thank god -The Cast & Crew
Riverdale,I don’t care your opinion on the show. 7 seasons for any show is impressive
Riverdale,Is the CW just done? They canceled basically everything
Riverdale,"THE WRITERS ARE FREE ELVES! THEIR SUFFERING HAS ENDED! 

Holy shit it went on so much longer than it should have. They gave them superpowers for fucks sake. I’ve seen less bonkers nonsense in anime."
Riverdale,[deleted]
Riverdale,About time. Stupid sexy ms grundy
Riverdale,SEVEN seasons of Archie’s horrible eyebrows!? Where has the time gone…
Riverdale,"I only watched a couple of episodes of Riverdale a couple years back, but I feel like Euphoria is the show Riverdale wanted to be."
Riverdale,"It was the lowest-rated show on the CW this season besides Nancy Drew. But whereas that show went directly to CW Seed, Riverdale was part of the now-defunct Netflix deal that also include several shows the network culled last week (such as Dynasty, Roswell, Charmed and Legacies). Being part of that deal meant the show was likely less profitable in its current state that Nancy Drew, making this cancellation a no-brainer"
Riverdale,"This’ll give him plenty of time to film the wonder twins movie now

Hang on"
Riverdale,"Holy hell, there's a blood bath in the CW"
Riverdale,Should’ve been canceled after s1
Riverdale,Riverdale gets a final season but Legends of Tomorrow doesn’t smh
Riverdale,Riverdale will have the same amount of seasons as Bojack Horseman and Mad Men and more than Breaking Bad and Community. I hate this timeline
Riverdale,This show made 7 seasons?
Riverdale,[deleted]
Riverdale,How this got 7 seasons and Sabrina about half this blows my mind.
Riverdale,It’s the CW. Just end it ALL.
Riverdale,A mercy. Riverdale started strong but got so weird so fast.
Riverdale,More like… Riverfail
Riverdale,I hate the way they say canceled because the contracts were up with season seven and also it’s the series finale it’s not like it just suddenly got canceled. Plus it’s not the worst kept secret that these actors have wanted to stop making the show after season five like Cole and KJ.
Riverdale,Lmao look at this guy’s hair color in the thumbnail. And you’re telling me this show made it to season 7? You should be happy it made it this far.
Riverdale,"Hooray!!!!🥳🎉🥳 Good job CW.

This was long overdue."
Riverdale,At least there is some good news today 👌
Riverdale,Thank the heavens
Riverdale,Having read some Archie comics when I was a kid.  The idea of a dark gritty Archie show always make me laugh.
Riverdale,Is the CW itself cancelled at this rate? They literally have nothing left at this point
Riverdale,"‘“I am a big believer in attempting to give series that have had long runs an appropriate sendoff,” CW Chairman and CEO Mark Pedowitz said during an executive call Thursday.’

I guess Legends of Tomorrow should just go fuck itself then. It already had a 7th season and they couldn’t be bothered to give it a final season."
Riverdale,Thank the old gods and the new.
Riverdale,I don't get why people say this show was bad. I fucking love it. I'm on season 4 right now and it's amazing. Each season is different and it seems like they can do whatever they want with it. Throw in some supernatural stuff? Why the heck not? Make a good guy a secret villain? Go right ahead. I feel like too many shows take themselves WAY too seriously these days and this show is a breath of fresh air. It's just so much freaking fun. I knew it would inevitably be canceled because there's no end goal for the story but 7 seasons is still a great run. I've loved seeing the characters get into all sorts of bizarre situations and all the amazing twists.
Riverdale,"Look, this show is great. Yes. What other show could give superpowers to the main cast in season 6. It has been a continous summersaulting sharks conga line, and the fact that they get one final season where they can go all in makes me excited"
Riverdale,"The main actors all signed contracts for seven seasons years ago, so they all knew when they were getting out. I suspect it’s more a “we would have to pay anyways” from the network rather than any kind of loyalty to the show."
Riverdale,I just started watching this in the background at work. I'm so excited to not pay attention for an hour and find Veronica using telekinesis to fight vampires or whatever the hell happens on this show
Riverdale,"I **LOVED** this show when I first got into it. I knew the Archie cast from all the comics at every single cash register in every grocery store in the world. The stories though, holy shit, I had no idea what I was getting into. ""A darker Archie series"". I had no idea there'd be cults, and witchcraft, and all this crazy shit.

It felt like an acid trip for an hour every week until I stopped watching a few seasons into it. The acting and way it was shot, was never really good. All the teenage sex drama wasn't for me, but I get there's a market for it, I'm just not it.

It's a shame this show doesn't get to have a proper ending, and in a way, I'll miss this, but I'm glad it's over so everyone can move on to different things."
Riverdale,The fact that is was on CW should have tipped everyone off
Riverdale,"I know it's trash, but it's mindless dreck, and sometimes I just really need to watch shit that pulls me in and makes me feel like at least my problems aren't so bad. I looked forward to Riverdale, I'll miss it."
Riverdale,"we can shit on CW and their wonky productions as much as we like, but we can also take a moment to appreciate that they are not renewing Riverdale past the NEXT season.  Not after the current one. 

So they have an entire season to build a finale arc rather than ""oh, I guess we're not going to get to resolve that cliffhanger ending"" like the vast majority of shows seem to get these days."
Riverdale,"This show is fucking insane. You got high school kids running biker gangs, owning a gym, controlling an organized crime empire and being an FBI serial killer profiler. Its all just murder and bullshit teen drama."
Riverdale,"10 years from now people will rediscover this show and it will become the next twin peaks, beloved for how balls-to-the-wall crazy it is"
Riverdale,No way it went past season 2???!
Riverdale,Thank. Fuck. I think I can say that for everyone including the actors here.
Riverdale,OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING! IM SO FUCKING HAPPY HOLY SHIT
Riverdale,Thank fucking god. What a cesspool of nonsense that was.
Riverdale,Finally
Riverdale,Wow. I didn't know it even made it to a season 3.
Riverdale,Meh…was never anything special anyway🤷‍♂️
Riverdale,"As a kid in early 00’s who crazed these comics like no other, the show sucked. They lost direction half way into season one and it had been downhill from there"
Riverdale,"Never knew there was 7 seasons, stopped watching midway through season 3"
Riverdale,Honestly the show ran for too long. Imagine it ended at season 3 or 4
Riverdale,Stupid show
Riverdale,Wow. Finally CW. You woke up.
Riverdale,"Talk about ruining a childhood comic book. This show was horrible, from the first season when Archie was with the teacher."
Riverdale,Silence haters. Riverdale is amazing! You think it’s a standard highschool drama when suddenly.. Floating babies! A cult leader fired out of a cannon! A multiverse bomb! A gargoyle king! 3 serial killers! Superpowers! The writers are on all the drugs and it should be everyone’s guilty pleasure. I’m sure season 7 will be WILD and I cannot wait to laugh at how great and also terrible it is.
Riverdale,"It is too bad that this show became a wacky, melodramatic and over the top adaptation. The Archie comics are great and I would've preferred an adaptation that was just a grounded show about coming of age stories with these characters. I don't understand why every YA show today has to be this over the top entertainment with mystery, murder, supernatural powers etc."
Riverdale,"The first 2-3 seasons of Riverdale are some of the most nonsensical and soapy television I’ve ever watched, but they hit the sweet spot of leaning into the ridiculousness for awhile."
Riverdale,I bet the cast are partying right now. They seemed like hostages.
Riverdale,"I mean it's not really canceled, it's just naturally ending because the actors contracts were up at the end of season seven anyway and I'm pretty sure it was going to be the end regardless."
Riverdale,Oh come on. It was hard to find a dumpster fire I wanted to watch.
Riverdale,Is the CW basically those Walker Texas Ranger and Kung Fu reboots now?
Riverdale,That show got extremely weird after season 2
Riverdale,took em long enough
Riverdale,"The berlanti production studio is filled
To the brim  with terrible people."
Riverdale,How tf did this get 7 seasons? It started in like 2017 didn't it?
Riverdale,Finally
Riverdale,"This thing did SEVEN seasons?

Feels like it just came out. I never watched it but it doesn't feel like I heard about the premiere that long ago.

Did they do more than a season per year?"
Riverdale,CW just canceled EVERYTHING on their network. What's left?
Riverdale,How has it been on this long in the first place?
Riverdale,oh thank goodness
Riverdale,"They got 7 seasons?! Damn… I watched the first two and enjoyed them, but couldn’t deal with season 3 so I dropped it"
Riverdale,Thank god
Riverdale,Thank God it’s finally over

Frontier,">I want hole.

I mean... What is actually happening in this article?"
Frontier,"Because whats the one major thing missing from all action movies these days guys?  

Full penetration."
Frontier,Geez. They’re really running out of ideas for clickbait.
Frontier,"Two words. Thundergun Express. 

He has to hang dong and they are gonna show it. Full penetr-ay-shon. That’s the twist."
Frontier,"Christopher Meloni showed his asshole decades ago on Oz. It’s a trend that didn’t continue even on HBO. Pornhub yes, HBO, no."
Frontier,I thought butthole
Frontier,"My problem is most of them are giant prosthetic penises, further exacerbating the problem young men face with body image issues. Let’s see a 3 inch flaccid realistic penis enough with the 8inches soft everywhere."
Frontier,"I’m disappointed that this article wasn’t about boners. Sure, SOME shows are revealing flaccid penises, but none are erect. (Hell, I’d still wager that there aren’t enough soft penises in tv shows either.) We still have a lot of room to grow!"
Frontier,"> Sebastian Stan’s talking penis in Pam & Tommy was fake,

I’m glad the writer could confirm this. For a minute there I thought it was a real talking penis."
Frontier,"How about we stop using stupid giant rubber fake penises on TV, and in the occasion a real one is seen, people don’t obsess online about that actors penis size? (The latter is likely why the former happens)"
Frontier,What’s the end game here? P in V on TV?
Frontier,"It's pretty hard to see a butthole or a vagina. They're literally concealed by other body parts (vulva, labia, butt cheeks). It's very easy to see a penis and balls. They hang right there. 

I'd argue that it's pretty impossible to see a vagina or butthole (vaginal opening) in a nonsexual context. If you go to a naturist camp you will probably not be seeing anyone's vagina or butthole. You'll see plenty of penises.

I don't get the point of this article. There are plenty of avenues for someone to look at buttholes or vaginas."
Frontier,But they’re mostly prosthetics.
Frontier,Penises in White Lotus... Top Gun: Maverick was a huge movie this year... it seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV.
Frontier,"The Latin plural of ""penis"" is ""penes.""

Though American English seems to be using ""penises.""

There, that's my contribution."
Frontier,The Boys Herogasm episode shows butthole
Frontier,"I don't even understand what the point of this article is, but before we discuss its actual content, let's just imagine for a moment what would happen if a male journalist were to write multiple articles about being entitled to celebrity nudity. Okay, now that we got that out of the way...

Its premise is that since we are seeing more penises on tv, we should be moving to the next step (vulva and anus), but then it brings up that most of the penises are prosthetic (which is a different kind of problematic that her linked article doesn't even cover), so it sounds like we haven't broken that frontier yet."
Frontier,"Its Time for the Final Frontier.

Even MORE Penises!"
Frontier,The most interesting thing about this article is that someone actually got paid to write it.
Frontier,"Just watch porn already if thats what you want.

The shock value of sex scenes in HBO shows have worn out, I think."
Frontier,I think we are now prepared as a society to show feet on television
Frontier,"I saw tons of dick in Jackass 3.  

Once you start talking about holes and man strudel on camera then the movies become less fun to watch with your parents."
Frontier,Finally a good article.
Frontier,Pseudo-refreshing take on human beings still just talking about their genitalia 🙄
Frontier,"Finally, a cause I can get behind"
Frontier,Yes but miss me with that merkin bullshit
Frontier,I must be watching the wrong shows!
Frontier,This journalist is going places
Frontier,Let’s see some bussy
Frontier,"Vulva, not vagina. You don’t call your face a throat."
Frontier,"I think that there might be a difference from an actor’s point of view between standing there with their penis/front of the vulva visible, and, like… spreading one’s legs to put as much on display as possible. Even if I could get on board with the first, the second would undoubtedly feel a whole lot more invasive. If the author is so desperate to see a hole, she should be first in line to welcome a camera into her nethers instead of questioning directors’ bravery for not demanding that of their talent."
Frontier,It’s annoying
Frontier,There's lots of penis' on TV?
Frontier,Penis: the final frontier.
Frontier,The author of this article could bend over in front of their mirror and get all the holes they want.
Frontier,Can first world problems jump the shark?
Frontier,"🎶  [Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener]

One wiener, next to another wiener

[Wiener, wiener wiener, wiener wiener]

Two wieners alongside yet another wiener

[Party, wiener party, wiener party, party party, wiener party, wiener wiener]

Soft wieners, nice and soft, non-erect wieners!

[Keep them flopping, flopping wieners, floppy floppy, dangle wieners, dangle dangle]

Five wieners in my face  🎶"
Frontier,Other idea. How about instead of showing vaginas because they show penis. How about they don’t show either. A tv show is rarely bettered by them.
Frontier,What a raunchy article. Stopped reading because it was getting stupid
Frontier,No. 1 Rule: Slate links stay blue
Frontier,Nah I’m good. You can delete this now.
Frontier,Fuckin. What?
Frontier,"This article is…whew, it’s a lot. Jesus Christ dude. ‘I want hole’"
Frontier,"majority of people hate dick pics

TV producers and directors: we should put more penises on Tv"
Frontier,"Absolutely idiotic article. Why is this necessary for TV? If the writer wants to watch porn, they should just watch porn. I can't see full blown penetration being a crucial key plot point for any show or movie."
Frontier,"I think this person doesn’t realize that plenty of that exists, it’s called pornography. Maybe the show writers want to keep a television show, ya know, a couple of degrees away from porn?"
Frontier,"We try to pretend Hollywood got their act together after Weinstein and the Metoo movement. Nope, they just got more strategic and more hands-off about it.  To me nudity doesn’t do much for a story. A bit of realism here a bit of comedy there, but mostly it’s a pissing contest for how many actors/actresses/extras the team can get to drop trow. 

This scene is great, BUT what if there was a flaccid penis in it?"
Frontier,Why does it seem like the author of this article is mad that no one’s mad about dicks being on tv?
Frontier,Jesus that's a creepy article. You just know this person's porn stash is close up of buttholes.
Frontier,"Absolutely idiotic article. Why is this necessary for TV? If the writer wants to watch porn, they should just watch porn. I can't see full blown penetration being a crucial key plot point for any show or movie."
Frontier,Where? I've yet to see a penis on a TV show.
Frontier,The fcc doesn't prevent hbo from showing porn... This writer didn't do his due diligence
Frontier,"Weiner Weiner weiner Weiner Weiner weiner.



1 weeeeiiinnnerr next to a floppy weeinnnnneeeerrrr!

2 weaainnnneeers next to yet another weineeeeerrrrr!

1 Weiner, nice and soft, non erect, weeinneeertr.


Look up Weiner song on YouTube by our boys at south Park."
Frontier,Could have sworn I saw that in HOTD but didn’t rewind.
Frontier,The author of this article could bend over in front of their mirror and get all the holes they want.
Frontier,"The obscenity concern is actually overstated, you can show pretty much anything as long as there is a narrative around it so the overall work itself is not just a sex scene. 

(Which is why many older pornos used to have an excuse plot to get commercially sold, the newer ones are just repleased online and don't really worry about legality)."
Frontier,I have noticed a huge uptick in full frontal nudity in the last 10 years and it’s more dicks than poons. The poons also usually have a landing strip
Frontier,"Eh, not enough penis until every cop-adjacent show gratuitously throws in a scene at a male strip club with penises flopping every which way in time to the music. Until all sex scenes modestly and unbelievably manage to keep the woman's parts gracefully covered and nothing but penis is actually shown. Until the plot is advanced in a locker room full of dangling penii even though it has nothing to do with gyms or sports. Until every peeping person is rewarded with unsuspecting flaccid penis. Until an otherwise family movie shows flashes of penis, catching both parent and tween awkwardly unprepared. Nope, definitely not enough penis yet."
Frontier,"I mean, if it was critical for the plot or to move the story along, sure. I’m definitely not a stick in the mud. 

If they re-shot Basic Instinct today in 4K, [Sharon Stone’s leg un-crossing scene (NSFW)](http://www.mrskincdn.com/mrskin_data/blog_resources/000/000/013/062/7465.jpg?1455153303) comes to mind as actually a plot point as she was being seductive to the detectives. My guess is if they re-did that scene today, they would show way more. 

Apart from those special occasions, those areas are called ‘private parts’ for a reason. We’ve made it 100 years of mainstream cinema without needing to see too much kitty on the big screen and god knows we all know where to find it online if we need to see it. 

I vote we just keep these two art forms separated."
Frontier,"No-why? So the actors whose job it is to play these roles have to expose themselves even more to satisfy curiosity? A glimpse of fake dong swinging into view is plenty. Dicks protrude. They want to be seen. But assholes and vulvas are tucked away—porn shows us the ridiculous camera angles required to get a bird-s eye view. 

There is quality porn, made by fully consenting production teams and actors, if it’s really that important."
Frontier,"Sure, why not 😆"
Frontier,Or how about we go back to the good old days of shows having some sense of shame and restraint and toning the nudity down a bit?
Frontier,I know he’s not talking about starfish shots…
Frontier,Damnit Todd.
Frontier,Full penetration.
Frontier,"Sounding, felching, or what?"
Frontier,Anal?
Frontier,Are there?
Frontier,We don't see enough buttholes though.
Frontier,"Do you mean ""coitus""?"
Frontier,What the fuck why am I reading this
Frontier,Dennis Reynolds has entered the chat
Frontier,That line between porn and everything else is so blurred lately.
Frontier,Butt why?
Frontier,Butthole?
Frontier,"I feel like just 10 years ago, showing male full frontal was a huge no-no. What the hell happened?"
Frontier,Disturbing.
Frontier,"“An anus is viewed as pornographic whether it’s aroused or not“

Hmm."
Frontier,I WANT HOLE
Frontier,Peacemaker showed female pubic hair and vulva. That’s pretty close.
Frontier,I actually agree. I’m not begging for buttholes or pussy lips on tv but the puritanical rule over creativity in America has run it’s course and it’s time to grow up. God is dead and I’m horny.
Frontier,Is this Dennis trying to pitch his movie idea?
Frontier,"Conditions:

1. Nothing exciting on TV to write about because no one launches a major show right now due to holidays. 

2. Everyone’s kind of bored the week between Christmas and New Years

3. Go write an article that will get clicks"
Frontier,"Does anyone over the age of 18 actually enjoy sex scenes? I always skip past them, they add nothing 99%  of the time."
Frontier,"So is nudity really that important in your HBO stuff?  Like I'll be honest all having so much of it in GoT did was us question whether the kids should be watching it... which is pathetic because in all honesty other than the nudity they have seen worse in games and in other media...

Nudity is so rarely something that is there in a way that adds to the story, or as an important element to the story...  So often its just there for shock, or because a producer thought if they had tits they might get more eyes on the screen, which is a very bad sign for whatever the show is."
Frontier,r/BrandNewSentence
Frontier,Yes. It's time to see William Shatners penis
Frontier,Bone town?
Frontier,It's time for hole.
Frontier,this is one of the dumbest things ive ever read.
Frontier,"That's called pornography. IT's everywhere and essentially free. 

This is not a sophisticated argument. 

IF you want *cultured xxx* films then go make them. But don't fool yourself into thinking that you can combine these things and make everyone love them. Somethings just don't make sense together. Orange juice and milk are great on their own, but mixing them doesn't work."
Frontier,"These sorts of scenes are popular for like a few days and then they’re forgotten about. It’s because they’re almost all shot in the same drab, boring cinematography that’s ten feet away from the actor. There should be something unique and memorable that’ll stick in the viewer’s mind. It should highlight the body and its features instead of treating it like an alien sighting. AND NO PROSTHETICS!!!!! I’m sick of them"

Frontier,Writer also said Vulva could be next step. Do they not know what a vulva is? That's been shown already since the 1970s (maybe even the late 60s here and there).
Blood,"He beat a murder rap - his wife was shot in the head. Wanna guess what his alibi was? I'll tell you.

HE COULDN'T HAVE MURDERED HIS WIFE, BECAUSE HE WAS IN A RESTAURANT LOOKING FOR HIS GUN WHILE SHE WAITED IN THE CAR. 

No, really. That's it. Stop laughing. Why are you laughing?"
Blood,"Wow. I thought he’d already died. (?) I think he was also the final surviving cast member from the 1930’s “Our Gang” / “Little Rascals” short subject movies of the 1930’s. 

Probably did murder his wife in the 80’s."
Blood,“Baretta did that shit” - Chappelle Show
Blood,"Like everyone else, I thought he was already dead.

In case you forgot, back in May 2001, he murdered his wife, but was found not guilty in an even worse jury verdict than OJs

Every interview post murder trial was a train wreck, he called Piers Morgan ""Charlie Potatoes"" for some reason."
Blood,"Many a murder mystery is driven by a despicable character killed off, and the detective finding that every character had a motive. Place it in Hollywood, and you have another slew of mystery books with all sorts of wannabe's, agents, failed actors, a compromised police force, prostitutes, and the like in the mix.

Blake's case was Hollywood Noir, but the trial took years to get to court, and it lost juice as time went by. It didn't help that everyone hated the victim, who was as vile a Hollywood denizen as there has ever been. But you have to wonder how their now-adult daughter dealt with it all."
Blood,Who gets the bird?
Blood,"Robert Blake seemed tormented. I never saw the last interviews but he was definitely unfiltered and a loose cannon on Johnny Carson when I watched it in the late 80’s. 
 He had been a child actor and it was probably schtick but he exuded working class contempt for Hollywood. 
It was always, “Can you believe how phony these people are?”
 Well, “You oughta know?”"
Blood,"I always felt bad when I saw him on The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder. He came off like a walking wound, like he had really seen some shit."
Blood,"Like most, I thought he passed away already years ago lol."
Blood,Oh no a piece of shit who murdered his wife died. Better put that 'in memoriam' for the next Oscars.
Blood,"[♪♫ Somewhere over the rainbow ♫ ♪](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2W59_noYo8)

What a coincidence he starred in Baretta and In Cold Blood."
Blood,He was great in Lost Highway. Rest in Power Mr Blake 🙏🏻
Blood,"RIP,  Bobby.  You were great in almost everything, especially In Cold Blood and Electra Glide in Blue."
Blood," ""Give me back my phone"""
Blood,"That’s a hell of a thing to mention in an obituary.

He must not’ve been real well liked to have it mentioned he got off on a murder charge."
Blood,"The larger problem is, that wasn't the gun that killed her. 

It is pretty obvious he had his bodyguard kill her. The prosecution should have tried to convict the bodyguard with an offer for a lesser sentence if he testified against Blake. There might be reasons that would not have worked but on the surface at least that seems like the way you would get to Blake."
Blood,I mean they prob ran ballistics on said gun and it didn’t match otherwise the case would have been a slam dunk. She sounded shady af tho.
Blood,80s? It was in 2001
Blood,"Sidney Kibrick  (""Woim"")    is still alive.       Margaret Kerry,  was in a few episodes as a background character,  is also still alive.....    but Woim is the last of the main cast."
Blood,"Abe Vigoda and I think, before him, if the Tommy Lee Jones bio-pic “Cobb” can be believed, Ty Cobb pretty much dropped out of sight in the 20’s and everybody was surprised he was living reclusively, if still an active wrecking ball, into the 1950’s when a biographer found him and wrote his biography."
Blood,"Ultimately, death gives us all the bird!"
Blood,He really had. I heard stories of his dad walking him around on a dog leash.
Blood,"Innocent until proven guilty, unless you're acquitted of the murder which means you're... guilty??"
Blood,"Eh, maybe, but there was no physical evidence whatsoever tying him to it.

He was probably involved, but she was a worse person than he was, and that's even if he was a murderer."
Blood,"That laugh, followed by ""Give me back my phone,"" is probably the peak of his career.  Even though the director is a Polanski apologist, you can't deny that together, they made good scenes to meme."
Blood,He was fantastic in Electra Glide in Blue.
Blood,"I don’t think it has much to do with like or dislike, it’s just hugely relevant. It was a major story when the murder and the trial happened. It would make no sense to not mention it."
Blood,"It was the most significant thing in his troubled life. Yeah, it deserves to be mentioned."
Blood,"He was well-liked enough to get off in an open-and-shut murder case. And yeah, when you kill your wife, it will be mentioned in your obituary. They fucking mentioned in Audrey Hepburn’s obituary the controversy of her getting the part in *My Fair Lady* over Julie Andrews."
Blood,"You are correct. But it's a super hilarious alibi, nonetheless. It seems fairly obvious that Blake had someone kill her while clearly setting up a seemingly airtight alibi (who leaves his gun in an Italian restaurant by accident, anyway?)

It's the ""Hey, there's no way the defense would bring it to anyone's attention that he was carrying a gun that night unless he was actually innocent!"" defense. It's so stupid that it might just work. It did work.

 And, as you pointed out, it wasn't the murder weapon.

 It reminds me of that Simpsons episode where Moe hires Homer to commit insurance fraud by pushing his car down a hill into the ocean, but before Homer steals the car Moe makes sure to point out to police that his is the one with a rubber hippie daisy on it."
Blood,Why would Robert Blake have a bodyguard? No one was looking for him.
Blood,I feel like he probably hired someone to do it and being out with her was the setup. The “I had to go back to the restaurant for my gun” explanation is baffling though. Why not leave your wallet?
Blood,"I just looked it up, 2001, and her bio is wild"
Blood,I stand very corrected! Wow! Sorry!
Blood,I really liked the Woim character in that series.
Blood,Swear that some if these old celebs get “killed off” several times before they actually die as car radio filler stories before they actually die!!
Blood,"Unbelievable! That was so long ago, now!"
Blood,a civil jury found him liable
Blood,Yeah the murder victim is definitely worse than the murderer
Blood,">who leaves his gun in an Italian restaurant by accident, anyway? 

My spouse is an academic that does research on policing...you would be fucking ***appalled*** at how many cops lose their firearms, some on a regular basis. A HUGE number of these guns are then used in the commission of violent crimes. Many of these losses are never even documented.

https://www.thetrace.org/2018/11/lost-and-stolen-police-guns/

Outside of police, ***A QUARTER OF A MILLION*** firearms are reported lost/stolen EVERY YEAR in the US. 

But no, we don't have a gun problem in this country. Nope. Nothing to see here.

Please note, none of this should be construed as defending the shitstain in the OP article."
Blood,Reminds me of the episode of Law & Order with Gary Busey kills his wife....oh wait......
Blood,Blake was paranoid and quick to fight. He got mad at a question from Howard Stern and made a scene. I could see him getting into a lot of fights. The bodyguard probably spent more time protecting Blake from himself than others.
Blood,Maybe to throw some suspicion on himself initially that was easily disproved and might deter investigators from looking at him hard a second time? That was a long and drawn out investigation and trial which prob carried quite a lot of stress for him personally. Such things tend not to be great for your health so making it to 89 is something.
Blood,"What happens is that they disappear from public life, either by intent or the nature of fame, and everyone just assumes they must have died. It started with Abe Vigoda, who retired from acting at 60. Every few years people would be saying he died and of course it would get back to him, and he'd pop up just long enough to say he wasn't dead yet. Then after 34 years of this he really did die and it took awhile for people to believe it."
Blood,She prostituted her daughter...
Blood,"In this case, maybe..."
Blood,"Lol. When I was in the Army, I had to sign for my M-16 every time it left the arms room, in addition to every single live round. I bet the entire Company would be on lockdown for weeks if I came back missing my rifle. And that's in garrison, not even in a hot zone."
Blood,Thank you for this info! Even more madness than we would even expect! That is saying something!
Blood,"Good article, BTW. Thanks for the info."
Blood,"Yep, when you think about it, in a way, it's actually kind of genius lmao"
Blood,"Gene Hackman was just in the news because no one has really ""seen"" himsince 2006.  He's very thin, but at 93 was still driving around, filling up, eating a burger. Some just retire, like regular people."
Blood,"True Blood without nudity?

Look how they massacred my boy"
Blood,"edited for content (but still TV-MA) and with ad breaks. not a new thing for HBO (Sex and the City still airs on E!, Sopranos and Curb have been on cable in the past), but it hasn't been done for more recent HBO shows like this."
Blood,"By far one of the funniest moments on Silicon Valley will be edited out.

When Gilfoyle sees Jared's lips after he gets injections

https://youtu.be/DmVgCB6sBZM"
Blood,"Why does nobody talk about Silicon Valley anymore? I haven't heard anyone mention it once since it ended. 

It started to decline as the seasons went on, but not that much, and the finale was actually well-received."
Blood,"Content edited True Blood will remove everything that was good about the series.

 Pam entering the room, starting a sentence, and then leaving abruptly.

Eric smirking, and then leaving abruptly.

Jason Stackhouse is now a mute."
Blood,"After editing out all the sex and gore enough to be aired on regular cable, is each episode of True Blood going to be about 15 minutes long?"
Blood,"Silicon Valley is so funny. S5 was incredible and I quite liked s6, although it was completely unnecessary 

Gavin's signature resembling a dick is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in recent years"
Blood,R.I.P.  Dick jerking scene :(.
Blood,There’s next to zero reason to watch a sliced to shit True Blood on cable.
Blood,That means new audiences will never have to see that scene in True Blood where Bill twists Lorena's head around while they're hatefucking. I envy them.
Blood,"Silicon Valley has only gotten better as time has gone on, I think it was overshadowed by Veep during it's original run."
Blood,It’s all about D2F
Blood,"Silicon Valley will be weird, but manageable on basic cable... but True Blood has to censor too much nudity and sex and language and violence/gore for it to work."
Blood,...Half of True Blood is plainly NSFW. I still feel Season 1-3 were good TV. It just jumped the shark after that.
Blood,TBS still exists?? Like tvs superstation?? Anyone remember dinner and a movie?
Blood,How will they edit the horse fucking background scene with gallons of horse jizz flying everywhere in Silicon Valley?
Blood,"This brings me back to when Fox used to air edited episodes of HBO's 90s show, Dream On.  I'd never seen it, but hearing this news is like bringing that full circle."
Blood,No point to watching true blood on tnt or tbs
Blood,[This Sopranos on PAX (a family channel in the 00s) skit has aged well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqE7ZxH7BJE)
Blood,People are acting like they won’t be able to still watch the original episodes. Chill out. This is actually a good decision by Zaslav.
Blood,This is the future for cable; reruns instead of originals.
Blood,There's no way they can do True Blood justice on TNT.
Blood,This seems random as hell.
Blood,Zaslav is such a failure.
Blood,"Why? Half the appeal of true blood was the boobs and now you don’t get that, so"
Blood,"I guess HBO’s plan is to make less premium shows available on other platforms, so they can get the viewers and bring in more money. It’s not the worst idea as long as they can keep producing great shows out and we as consumers will not necessarily lose out. It may come at the detriment of having more services, but I guess they’ll keep their best and most valuable shows in in-house."
Blood,"For what it’s worth, they’re being given extended programming blocks and airing as TV-MA.

I’m not exactly sure what will be edited out or not, but that’s promising."
Blood,How are they gonna do the jerk off calculation scene in SV lmao
Blood,"Not just the nudity, but the cursing, the gore - I just imagine it being like that MadTV skit where it is a broadcast edit of The Sopranos and the episode ends up being like three minutes long with hilarious jump cuts every time somebody starts speaking."
Blood,Gotta edit those episodes to 18 minutes to make room for commercials.
Blood,Suckie.
Blood,Theres a whole fucking season based on orgies pretty much when that succubus comes into town haha
Blood,David fucking Zaslav
Blood,"Is “you brought piss to a shit fight"" tv ma?"
Blood,"[Reminds me of the classic MadTV skit about The Sopranos on PAX TV lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqE7ZxH7BJE)

Remember PAX?"
Blood,">edited for content (but still TV-MA)

I'm not American, and even if I were I don't watch TV, so what does that mean practically speaking? Surely, *surely* they're not touching [the middle out scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex1JuIN0eaA)?"
Blood,True Blood without boobies and butts? *Sacrilege.*
Blood,"True Blood doesn't qualify as ""more recent"" given it ended almost 9 years ago. Yes it's been this long, we are old."
Blood,">Why does nobody talk about Silicon Valley anymore

TJ Miller and Thomas Middleditch ended up being creeps."
Blood,"As someone who truly enjoy the show despite it's shortcomings and worked in tech for years, it's disturbingly accurate"
Blood,I'm just finishing a re-watch and it's so fucking funny.
Blood,"Like you said, the show got worse. I think Tj Miller leaving left a huge hole in the show. A lot of the best moments in the show involve him. I also thought post-Tj seasons had characters go the Flanderization route a little too much. 

I also just think a lot of the jokes will fly over people’s heads if you’re not knowledgeable of the tech business. It doesn’t have the same appeal as some of the other big comedies of the last decade or so."
Blood,"I started watching it about a week and a half ago, and it's really good!"
Blood,"I liked it, but it simply was never that popular."
Blood,Tip to tip for maximum efficiency
Blood,"I think a factor is Big Tech is viewed very differently now compared to when the first season came out. The phrase ""Big Tech"" wasn't even a thing. The premise just isn't as appealing. When big tech comes out with its latest ""revolution"" your mind just goes straight to how it could make the world a worse place. A lot of the dreams of Silicon Valley ethos never came true. Their ideology has proven to be a joke."
Blood,Season 3 it fell into a hyper repetitive pattern and almost everyone I've ever talked to stopped watching after that.
Blood,90% of Sam’s scenes are gone
Blood,The whole season about the succubus just deleted xD
7th Grade Civil Servant,When I was in high school my Spanish teacher had us watch episodes of the Simpsons in spanish.
7th Grade Civil Servant,There are plenty of Steven Universe filler episodes you could show the class.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"No ideas, but Fresh Prince is now played on mtv and Will Smiths son hangs out with the Kardashian, so pretty sure they would know Freah Prince (isn't that all they care about? Lol)
"
7th Grade Civil Servant,I remember reading this episode's script in a textbook in either middle or high school.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"This clip omits the closing narration:

>The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout. There are weapons that are simply thoughts, attitudes, prejudices...to be found only in the minds of men. For the record, prejudices can kill...and suspicion can destroy...and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own – for the children and the children yet unborn. And the pity of it is that these things cannot be confined to the Twilight Zone."
7th Grade Civil Servant,Why would you post this?  YOU must be the alien!
7th Grade Civil Servant,Best episode of the series in my opinion.
7th Grade Civil Servant,I lament but only one upvote to give.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I'm currently in the process of watching the whole show from start to finish. It is incredible, I would recommend it to everyone."
7th Grade Civil Servant,I always thought this was a social commentary on Mccarthyism.
7th Grade Civil Servant,I remember first watching this in my 7the grade English class. We read through the script as a class and then watched the episode
7th Grade Civil Servant,This show has stood the test of time so well. I’ve revisited numerous episodes quite a bit.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I find this episode too absurd.  It is completely unbelievable that a group of comfortable, middle-income people on an average street in America would let fear take them over so completely that they would act against their own self-interest and become animals towards their neighbors.

It would never happen.  Ever."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"The 2002 twilight zone remake redid this episode but changed ""aliens"" to ""terrorists"" to make it ""edgy"" post 9/11 commentary but when you remove the metaphor the whole thing falls flat."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I was so, so disappointed but the reboot. The original is absolutely timeless, the remake was just terrible."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Very “Lord of the Flies” vibe here. Chaos can be instilled so easily in the most peaceful individuals, given the right circumstance."
7th Grade Civil Servant,Best episode they ever made.
7th Grade Civil Servant,My favorite episode
7th Grade Civil Servant,Fav series
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Everyone cites Maple Street, but the more apt and chilling episode that foresaw the times we're living through now is ""It's A Good Life"""
7th Grade Civil Servant,Good ep!
7th Grade Civil Servant,One of my favorite episodes and totally relevant today.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"When I taught 8th grade,  we watched this in our short story dystopia unit.  Great episode!"
7th Grade Civil Servant,I was so happy when we got to watch this episode in one of my High School English classes.
7th Grade Civil Servant,This was always was my favorite episode.
7th Grade Civil Servant,I show this to my students in US history when we teach the Cold War and McCarthyism. Always a fan favorite even for high school juniors
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Season 1, episode 22.  Currently on Netflix and Hulu."
7th Grade Civil Servant,How's the Jordan Peele reboot? I haven't heard anything about it
7th Grade Civil Servant,"In case you didn't notice, the kid is Bill Gates who warned us."
7th Grade Civil Servant,[deleted]
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Rod Serling really hated people didn’t he? Or more specifically, the privileged ones? He’s like the cynical Gene Roddenberry."
7th Grade Civil Servant,My seventh-grade reading book had the entire episode. We were assigned parts and read it as a class.
7th Grade Civil Servant,Came here to say the same thing. I’m pretty sure it was 7th grade.
7th Grade Civil Servant,Same!  Although it was in one of those newsprint newsletter-type things (back in the late 70’s). It had this script and “The Midnight Sun”. I liked Midnight Sun more.
7th Grade Civil Servant,We didn’t read the script in 7th grade but we did watch the episode!
7th Grade Civil Servant,[deleted]
7th Grade Civil Servant,OH SHIT SAME. Was 6th grade for me. We weren’t the only ones then. We acted it out in class.
7th Grade Civil Servant,TIL Palpatine likely got inspiration from Rod Serling
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Another good one...

7th Grade Civil Servant,">to be found only in the minds of men

read that in his voice lol"
7th Grade Civil Servant,Great flair ❤️
7th Grade Civil Servant,Maybe you're trying to draw suspicion away from yourself? Maybe YOU'RE the alien!
7th Grade Civil Servant,“Time Enough at Last” takes the cake for me.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I think it is certainly powerful but there are many good ones. To serve man, the one with the devil trapped in the closet, the one with the man who finds the tiny people on another planet, the guy who gets 3 wishes, the rip van winkle robbers, just so many."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Definitely a classic, but my fav is ""It's a Good Life"" and I LOVE the Fallout 3 vault that gave a nod to the episode."
7th Grade Civil Servant,5 Character's in Search of an Exit is the best episode of the Twilight Zone and also timely.
7th Grade Civil Servant,“And When the Sky Was Opened“ doesn’t get nearly as much love as it deserves. It’s my personal favorite.
7th Grade Civil Servant,The Shelter is very good too
7th Grade Civil Servant,"It's up there with ""He's Alive""."
7th Grade Civil Servant,The Hitchhiker
7th Grade Civil Servant,"When I was a teenager and saw this with my father in New Year's, it was quite the revelation to me when I finally understood what the premise was really about it and it shook me for a bit."
7th Grade Civil Servant,So many excellent episodes.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"For me it's ""And when the sky was opened"""
7th Grade Civil Servant,"It's hard to pick, there are so many hard hitters in just season one alone. One for the Angels, Walking Distance, that one with the one family that has a bunker, the one with the astronauts who land on the planet with the miniature people, the one with Charles Bronson and Samantha from Bewitched. The show was just consistently at peak."
7th Grade Civil Servant,Easily top 3 in my book. Walking Distance and The Obsolete Man are my top 3.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Nah, Obsolete Man is the peak of the series."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Well yeah. The remark about the ""fifth column"" makes it relatively clear."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"> For the record, prejudices can kill...and suspicion can destroy...and a thoughtless, frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all of its own – for the children and the children yet unborn

You don't say?"
7th Grade Civil Servant,Im pretty sure the episode on Mcarthurisym would Be 4 O'clock. The one mwntioned above is on mans ability to put suspicion on everyone for their own faults.
7th Grade Civil Servant,I swear we all had the same 7th grade curriculum. I distinctly remember someone in the episode saying “no dice” and us all thinking it was the funniest thing ever
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Sarcasm is only funny when it makes a non-obvious point.

Absolutely *no one* finds this unbelievable."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"The original was about communism though. 

The 2002 episode was pretty clever. Still the Muslims were acting suspiciously."
7th Grade Civil Servant,[deleted]
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Which remake? The 80s one, the 2000s one, or the one with Jordan Peele?"
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I liked the Adam Scott Nightmare episode, at least. Though, that premise might just be timeless."
7th Grade Civil Servant,You should take a break.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I don't think he hated people. I think his experiences as a Jewish American serving in WWII and seeing the atrocities of war made him pessimistic and skeptical of people in charge. He suffered from pretty severe PTSD.

I think ""mistrustful"" and ""skeptical"" would be better words to describe him."
7th Grade Civil Servant,A South Park fan is being critical of Serling's view of humanity? What. The. Fuck.
7th Grade Civil Servant,We got ourselves a poor man's Dildoschwaggins over here.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Same. I volunteered to be the guy that just says ""I'll go check the other street"" and leaves without another word."
7th Grade Civil Servant,Did I just find my 7th grade English class?
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Huh, did everyone have to do this?"
7th Grade Civil Servant,YES! I really enjoyed reading it in class
7th Grade Civil Servant,Same here. We read the entire script than watched the episode.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"It was in a textbook that even had the classic Abbott and Costello ""Who's on First"" routine."
7th Grade Civil Servant,It’s weird how we all did this in 7th grade.
7th Grade Civil Servant,Currently a 7th grade ELA teacher. It’s in my textbook and a recommended text by my states curriculum. So maybe not so weird. I definitely wanted to teach it over other things
7th Grade Civil Servant,Everyone got inspiration from Rod Serling.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"thanks, great username!"
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Both of you are acting suspicious, trying to cause a panic around here."
7th Grade Civil Servant,There was T I M E now!
7th Grade Civil Servant,Don’t forget Agnes Moorhead being invaded by space men.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"My mid 20's nephew and GF were visiting and had never seen the twilight Zone, I showed them  Maple Street, To Serve Man, and the tiny people one.  Made me laugh, at the start of the first episode when the theme music came on, they both said, ""Oh, this is where that comes from!"""
7th Grade Civil Servant,The Howling Man!
7th Grade Civil Servant,">It's a Good Life

What about the sequel where he and his daughter both have the power?"
7th Grade Civil Servant,I think that's the episode that introduced me to the concept of existential horror.
7th Grade Civil Servant,"So sad when they put Ned Flanders outside :-(

But so heartwarming when everyone comes out together to sing!"
7th Grade Civil Servant,"""Where will he go next, this phantom from another time, this resurrected ghost of a previous nightmare – Chicago? Los Angeles? Miami, Florida? Vincennes, Indiana? Syracuse? New York? Anyplace, everyplace, where there's hate, where there's prejudice, where there's bigotry. He's alive. He's alive so long as these evils exist. Remember that when he comes to your town. Remember it when you hear his voice speaking out through others. Remember it when you hear a name called, a minority attacked, any blind, unreasoning assault on a people or any human being. He's alive because through these things we keep him alive.""
[He's Alive, Closing Monlogue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/He%27s_Alive)

To say that in 1959 to America, full of war vets and with all the race tensions took some balls."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"I went to school with a girl that looked just like Inger Stevens, it was uncanny.  Sad to see the actress passed way back in 1970."
7th Grade Civil Servant,[deleted]
7th Grade Civil Servant,Do...do you know what sarcasm is?
7th Grade Civil Servant,Yeesh. That sounds like a particularly weak episode of the '90s Outer Limits
7th Grade Civil Servant,"The 80s one is okay, not nearly as creative or impactful as the original, the 2000s one is bad but good in a bad way, and Jordan Peele's is unwatchable."
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Yeah that, the gun one, there are a few good episodes but it's like they had good ideas and then just fumbled every single time imo"
7th Grade Civil Servant,"If the premise was timeless then why'd they have to move it 10,000 feet higher?"
7th Grade Civil Servant,"He was Jewish ethnically but wasn’t he a Unitarian religiously? I just wanted to get my info right.

BTW, that makes sense but being skeptical does imply he’s not a people person. I dunno, I guess it boils down to personality differences."
7th Grade Civil Servant,South Park isn’t a cynical show. The creators themselves have called themselves optimistic and believe in people. Do the research. I’m not even bashing Serling. It was just an observation.
7th Grade Civil Servant,RIP
7th Grade Civil Servant,"Oh man, same here. I always think of that when I watch the episode."
7th Grade Civil Servant,Same
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Love love loved this show. Season 2 is one of my favorite seasons of any show.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking\_the\_Dead\_(TV\_series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_the_Dead_(TV_series))

Waking the Dead is a British television police procedural crime drama series, produced by the BBC, that centres on a fictional London-based Cold Case unit composed of CID police officers, a psychological profiler and a forensic scientist. A pilot episode aired in September 2000, and a total of nine series followed. Each story is split into two hour-long episodes, shown on consecutive nights on BBC One. A third series episode won an International Emmy Award in 2004. The programme was also shown on BBC America in the United States, though these screenings are edited to allow for advertising breaks, as well as UKTV in Australia and New Zealand and ABC1 in Australia. A total of 46 stories aired across the nine series. The show aired its final episode on 11 April 2011. A spin-off from the series, titled The Body Farm, revolving around forensic scientist Eve Lockhart (Tara Fitzgerald), was announced by the BBC in January 2011 and ran for just one series."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,i didn't know season 5 had started airing. hell yeah
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I adore this show, have rewatched it a couple of times."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Love Unforgotten. Excited for Season 5. Disappointed that it doesn't seem to be available to watch in the U.S. yet.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I agree, Unforgotten is a great show. What I like most about it is that it takes it's time to tell the story. For the first few episodes you see the individual suspects leading normal lives that are far different from each other. You really do wonder how they are all connected, and how they tie in with the cold case murder. It's quite an engaging premise."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Just me, but while *Unforgotten* is good, it's not at all on the level of *Happy Valley.*  The show you send *Happy Valley* fans to is *Unforgiven* (and maybe *Scott & Bailey*), since they're all written by Sally Wainwright.

I'm also not 100% sure that *Unforgotten* is necessarily going to appeal that much to the *Line of Duty* crowd, who probably want more Jed Mercurio (*Bodies, The Bodyguard, Critical).* 

To me, *Unforgotten* is kinda more for the *Silent Witness* crowd. And I'm still reserving judgement on Season 5, given that Nicola Walker's Cassie Stuart is no longer the central character."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"The first four series of Unforgotten are incredible, up there with my favourite ever. Especially 2 and 4.

However, for me, Series 5 was a massive disappointment. I thought it had been written by someone different. It felt incompetently made."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Agreed! Cassie is one of my favourite characters.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Nice - I'll check it out.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Airing on Mondays and all available to binge on the ITV Hub - no idea why they did this!
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"the new ITV X policy I guess, I just binged it all in one afternoon."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I’m really enjoying this, but, as a London guy aged 55, I hope they don’t try and glamourise Ken Noy.

He was (is?) a really nasty individual, who went on to commit a really heinous act of murder in a road rage incident by the M25.

The guy’s fiancée eventually testified against him and had to go into witness protection, such was the fear for her safety."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,If that’s the best crime drama you’ve ever seen I think you need to be watching more crime dramas
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Watched the first ep. It was quite entertaining, but Idk if I'd put it give it such high praise. A lot of the acting & dialogue was pretty corny, & the accents at times were hard to understand, but I did enjoy it overall."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I live in the area and grew up around criminals that used the money from the job to fund establishing themselves as the  ruling class of criminals. It was so much money that you can trace who was involved.

Kind of crazy that it wasn't all just pissed up the wall instead they used it to launch other criminal endeavours."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,As a Norwegian who just binged all 6 episodes during a night shift I have a hard time believing that police corruption was this prevalent during the 80s? Can someone confirm or deny the general impression from this show?
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I am enjoying it.

But its not up to other series e.g. Line of Duty, Unforgotten, Happy Valley, Broadchurch"
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Man I guess this just isn’t possible for us in the US to watch unless we sail the high seas :/
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,I just finished it. I'm wondering there is a brief scene where a guy on a motorcycle assassinates another guy. I didn't really understand that scene. Who got assassinated and by who?
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,That's high praise. I'll have to give it a shot. I just finished series 3 of Happy Valley and was looking for something new to start. That one was incredible from beginning to end.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Yes, very promising first episode."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,I actually put this on my watchlist yesterday. Good to hear such a glowing review. I'm gonna throw it on when I finish catching up on Picard.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Only watched a couple of episodes, the first one seemed good, but I lost interest after that.  My BBC crime series viewing is limited but I'd put Slow Horses ahead of The Gold.  Just started Happy Valley and so far it's much better."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Watch the curse same story far funnier
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Yeah I agree. To say this is the best British crime drama is either pure hyperbole or just recency bias. I’d certainly put Happy Valley - all three of its seasons - above The Gold for starters. Like you said, the show can feel corny at times and just isn’t tight with its storyline or production. 

Good show nonetheless, but not something I’ve been blown away by thus far."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"If you think the accents were hard to understand in this show, try [the episode about the robbery in the show called ""Britain's Biggest Heists"" \(S01E01\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1583779/)"
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Corruption in The Met was very bad at the time. Not just masonic corruption, but police being paid off or police officers breaking the law themselves. The [Flying Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Squad) of the Met was famously corrupt and very involved in crime in Soho. There were lots of famous cases once corruption started to be tackled, but some of that corruption lingered and continued and went on to infect cases like the [murder of Stephen Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Stephen_Lawrence) or the [murder of Daniel Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Daniel_Morgan) , both cases in South-East London, the area that much of *The Gold* was about.

BBC made a [documentary](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000v4h4) about this period of police corruption last year that's worth a look if you can find it."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,The lead charecter went on to assist in the investigation of the massive corruption around the Stephen Lawrence murder
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,See the book The Untouchables by Michael Gillard
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"The man who got assassinated was the taxi driver who’d dropped Mickey’s girlfriend off and then raced off. I’m guessing he was killed in revenge for leaving her? 
I found Mickey’s storyline a bit confusing, his girlfriend takes an envelope to that man with the helicopter. Mickey says hope there’s no rain or wind. There is rain. Then 2 men are in his cell. I thought he was going to get killed or beaten, then he marries his girlfriend. I don’t get it."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Happy Valley was great. 

*The Gold* was an absolute delight, tho."

The Investigator: A British Crime Story,He explained the 2 men thingy right?
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I'm glad they got to finish Happy Valley, even if it took them 7 years. Gives me hope for other unfinished series."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,It took that long by choice and the writer having a lot of success. It's not like it was cancelled
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"I know, but still, it was 'unfinished' and they got to end it, and it was a fitting finale too. Lots of show cancelled and even on air ones, don't get to say the same."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Every time I see something like this said, I'm reminded of Andrea's friend's band in the Sopranos, who refused to put hooks or a chorus in his songs because they were 'Beatles bullshit' or something."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Although the article mentions that it's based on a real murder, it doesn't really reflect on why all of these creative decisions were made. Here’s my Danish perspective on it.

This show is doing an incredible balancing act, right on the razor’s edge of ethics, because in reality it is too soon for this case to have a TV-show. The parents are still grieving. The murderer is alive in prison trying to gain notoriety through a semi-successful, semi-botched prison escape.

It is also a beyond-gruesome murder only 3 years old. The details were so bad most of the mainstream media in Denmark that attended the trial deliberately stopped reporting their live blogs when the murder details were presented. Most people here are aware that it involved torture of the worst kind.

Still, it was all everyone could talk about. The investigation, as this show is mainly about, was like a slow burn thriller. Body parts washing up on the beach, the theatrical notion of the submarine crime scene, the charismatic, alleged murderer who had once been a recognized inventor, whose explanations gradually began to sound more and more desperate. To be perfectly honest, the case had a kind of inherent media magnetism.

But how do you make TV out of it? Early attempts at capitalizing on the infamy were condemned for being inappropriate. Even this show faced the same criticisms.

You can’t make it fully about the victim because what happens to her is so awfully bad that even an attempt at recreating it would throw the show into some fringe subgenre of horror, \*gore porn\*, or whatever you want to call it. Making it about the perpetrator would be unethical: glorifying him, his life, his achievements, and ultimately, the murder he committed.

So what’s left? Just the investigation, really. When “they almost never say \[the perpetrator’s\] name” it’s not because it’s a gimmick, it’s because they don’t want to glorify the murderer even further.

When the detectives don’t “stare mournfully at a photo of Wall while wondering aloud about what kind of a sicko could’ve done this to her,” it’s because we all did that. For weeks, and then months. I know the show dwells a lot on the parents’ grief, but its sober attempt at focusing on the investigation is in some ways a fresh take on a case with which everyone was very emotionally involved.

The show is a supplement to reality, which is why it might seem frustrating to those who weren’t there when it happened.

That’s just my take though."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,This show is premiering Monday? I’m sitting here on Sunday night waiting for my new SUNDAY night HBO shows.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Is it just me or is that article a bit of a mess?

Are they basically saying it doesn't follow every single cookie cutter crime drama? If so sounds interesting."

The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Scrolling through. See the posted photo. Think, aw cool. The next series of Borgen! 

Will watch anyway!"
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"They should have titled the show Frustration.

It's slow pacing but enjoyable."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Western television has police and military industrial complex behind it, so cops are always the good guys with super luck and iq. Realism is destructive to that dream."

The Investigator: A British Crime Story,scandinavian noir is still popular? i thought that was so 2008-2013?
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"It is a little funny that 90% of the article extols the series for avoiding cop show cliches like “telling us something about the victim” and “telling us something about the killer” and “fast forwarding through the repetitive process of going over the same area over and over looking for clues”. Then the last few paragraphs are like, “It’s too bad the show used the biggest cop show cliche of all time!”"
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,The parents agreed with the show to the point their dog played himself.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,">the submarine crime scene

The fucking what??"
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"u/Braoss, thanks for your comments.

For me, The Investigation, as a police procedural series, stood out in one way. It is all about the investigation, without any ""soap"". By ""soap"", I meant soap opera story lines that are unrelated to the case. Such as a detective's broken marriage, drinking problem, delinquent children, etc. Other TV series of this genre tend to add such story lines, as if to stretch the number of episodes, and appeal to those who cannot live without soap."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,It’s really good. At times it’s slow but it’s realistic. Crimes aren’t quick and easy to solve.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"Copenhagen is on two islands, Amager and Zealand."
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Well maybe in America.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,"It does get into those cliches as well though, some backstory/other info about both the killer and the victim (especially the latter).

Of course the largest cliche that's avoided is that there are no cheesy twists. We know what happened immediately when it happens, just like Jens) (even if is frustratingly hard to prove prove an acceptable legal standard)"
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,well I'm definitely watching the show now
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Man they really missed the opportunity to make the detective a dog then huh? Seems like he wanted to finally get his acting career rolling and they cast him in the most lazy way possible
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,The crime took place on a privately built midget submarine.
The Investigator: A British Crime Story,Which island is Denmark and which is Copenhagen?

There’s one user who has a 2 year old account but has over **7 million karma**.  When suspicions arise, he’ll occasionally say “oh, I just really love movies”.  But he’s the one posting 90% of everything on the entertainment subs and yet he never ever comments more than a synopsis or article quote.

A Series of Unfortunate Events,Well I hope it's the good ones from each of those series.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,🙌 this was my favorite book when I was a kid. I knew the film was going to be awful when I saw the trailer. I just need this to be good so badly.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"It's going to be tough to not make Percy look dense as a log on tv. I know in the books he has trouble reading because of his birth, but man he's not a very smart character."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Whether or not it's good, I like this trend of children's books with complicated plots and deeper issues getting short TV series to explore it rather than cramming in all the plot into 2 hours 15 minutes or so films. Mysterious Benedict Society, His Dark Materials, Unfortunate Events, etc."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Either this is gonna be the best D+ series or... I don't know.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"I have a feeling that given how Rick Riordan really wants the story to be accurate to his books, there's gonna be plenty of creative differences abound to where no director wants to work with him because of clashing visions and vice versa"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Fringe = Different versions of the same people

A Series of Unfortunate Events = Sadness

Lost = Confusion

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D = Time travel

Black Sails = Ships

So you can wait to watch a doppelgangers sad confusing time traveling cruise or you can simply Watch [Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17XqBdCiHOI), the bestest movie ever."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Just need to also add one writer paid only to shut down any pop culture references.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Legit can't tell if this is supposed to be impressive or funny
A Series of Unfortunate Events,From the first or last seasons?
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Cool!
A Series of Unfortunate Events,And yet still not green lit?
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"So, a mixed bag at best. 👍"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Those shows had duds. Which writers, and what episodes did they write?"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Dear lord they take the shows with the worst endings, literally all of the worst endings in tv and you take their writers?"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Lost? Oh no
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Since Rick Riordan is involved,I believe it will be better than the movies."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"I looked over the episodes from the woman who wrote for Lost, Agents of SHIELD, and Fringe (well, her Lost and AoS episodes). She worked on mostly above average episodes of the shows but not the standouts."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Many problems of those series is due to not having an overall planned structure, and being a typical 22-episode American series that wants to be prolonged into infinity. Since the books give a complete story, writers will be restricted by a source material, so there's a higher chance for something good.

If it was a year long network tv show vaguely based on book premise, I would be worried."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Hahaha I read this comment I hope it’s the good ones from each house. I assumed this was camp halfblood reference. 

I’m a little excited. Bc that movie disappointed me."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Nope. It’ll just be the boringly melodramatic, loose ends, beat-a-dead horse writers. 

J/k. I love all of those shows (Except I haven’t seen Black Sails), so I think I can criticize them all a bit."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Well, Rick and his Wife are gonna be super involved this time around. I have high hopes."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"It's honestly pretty crazy how they fucked up the movie. The book is like a perfect Harry Potter franchise set up with the books, the kids getting older, and the mythical sensation you can get from the world. A TV show will give them more breathing room and it would be insane if they fucked up such a good story twice."

A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Yeah man, I dunno, I'm getting baaaaad vibes from the whole thing. I can picture shit when I'm reading the books, but a series of novels and a TV series are very *very* different."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"I read his blog the other day, with his notes to the movie producers - he gave them excellent advice, which they disregarded and failed.

A Series of Unfortunate Events,LOST had time travel and ships.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Black Sails = colonization
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Come on, you cannot simplify Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D to just time travel. That was only the last few seasons."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Triangle is genuinely stellar!
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Yeah, what a list of clunkers. Those shows range from terrible to below average, but every show has its apologists."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,they still need a director apparently
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Well, they need to get a draft, test it with audiences, and find some promising cast members. Then, we’ll probably get a green light. After that, we’re looking at about a year of filming and producing. 

My guess, we’ll see this series pop up any time from 2023 to 2025"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Read the article.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Luckily the books already have an ending, and a fucking fantastic one at that. (Also Black Sails ending is pretty damn good)"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Marvel's Agents of SHIELD has one of the most bittersweet, but still clearly happy endings I have ever seen. Every character still alive has their happy ending and gets to live on as they choose, something they have all been yearning for for the whole series.

Not only that, ASoUE also has a great, ambiguous ending that is very inkeeping with the books. It hints at further plots without it being an outright declaration of another series."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Monica Owusu-Breen, if anyone's curious. 

And yeah, I'd agree with that assessment. Mostly decent but not extraordinary episodes of AOS, decent episodes of Fringe. She wrote The Well, which is one of the better eps from the first half-season of AOS, but she also wrote ""One Of Us,"" which is probably the weakest episode of the second season."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"A quick look (and not remembering the episodes well), but her AOS  episodes seem unimportant to the overall storyline."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"give Black Sails a go, especially as it develops in the later seasons"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"His wife? I'm a little confused on why she'd be involved.

Edit: instead of downvoting me maybe you guys could explain? I'm really am wondering why his wife would be involved."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Eh, unless a physical trait is literally essential to who a character is as a person, like Django’s skin color or Tyrion Lannister’s height, it’s really not important. In 95% of cases, in fact probably more, its better to get a more talented actor that looks less like the character than pick a weaker performer just for superficial similarities. 

Had the writing been good and performance been engaging, no one would care if her hair were black, brown, auburn or blond."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"it's interesting how people are annoyed with changes of Percy movies for worse, but suddenly when it comes to Netflix Witcher, people try to defend awful decisions and butchered stories with ""who even wants to see what they have read"". like.. what?"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"The boy has monsters trying to eat him for 5 years straight, yet he doesn't just pick up an audio book on Greek myth once"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,It's a shame it never got adapted
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Yeah they should have just adapted it into a show rather than the expensive mess we got.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Artemis Fowl deserves that.  
edit : I said that on the comment above saying series should be used for good young adult books. the movie was a shit show, a serie *could* be good.

Reddit somehow decided to put that comment underneath a new comment instead..."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"yeesh, that hurts.   it really highlights the fact that the problems with the movie were intentional and easily avoidable, except that the suits *did. not. care.*"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,They were boats.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"It can't be, there was no colonization in **Triangle**."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Black Sails and ASOUE were superb. Lost was very good for a while, though it went off. Agents has some fantastic seasons, and some duds.

Haven't watched Fringe

Still, overall it's more ups than downs"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"I don't even know the books, but judging from the previous movies(s) I hope they get someone from good Coming-of-Age movies to add a little heart into the mix, because as pure spectacle and adventure stuff it wasn't very good."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"A director/showrunner who didn't want to be involved in setting up the writers room...

Edit: a single director for all episodes but they won't be a showrunner and didn't choose writers. Oof."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Pilot is written. They need a director.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,mmmmm...no. I don't think I will.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,I should caution people that the *credited* writer on a TV episode isn’t necessarily the person who wrote the episode.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"I remember the name Monica Owusu-Breen because it was announced a few years ago that she was going to be the showrunner of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer reboot, although I don't think that's actually happening any more"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"on the other hand, it may be even better when working with already written material.. maybe?"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"She worked on so many shows that I watched back in the day (Alias, Lost, Fringe, Brothers and Sisters) and the only series where she wrote noteworthy episodes was Fringe."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,That's not really something she probably had too much control over. Generally the way a writer's room works for these shows is showrunners and the writers sit and plot out an entire season or arc and then the showrunners assign writers which episode they'll write.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,She was involved a lot in the writing if I’m not mistaken.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"It's not all that uncommon in entertainment for couples to work together since they often meet and work in the same industry as well. Similar to how Zach Snyder usually has his wife as a producer on his works. Other examples: Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow, Dave Franco and Alison Brie."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"I mean it kinda was an important introductory point?  In the first book it was said that Annabeth works extra hard due to trying to get over the “blonde ditz” superstition, and that was referenced a couple times in the later books as well."

A Series of Unfortunate Events,Artemis Fowl was such a shitshow it made Eragon look like Fight Club
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"You know.. it just kills me. You have source material that literally sold millions of copies. You have said author giving you permission to basically copy it word for word and translate it to a screen. but no you have to change things.

I know some things in movies get changed and they don't really matter. Like how people meme the whole thing from goblet of fire and how Dumbledore was calm in the book and in the movie he was furious. Does it really matter? Imo no. Sure Dumbledore is generally a calm dude and seeing him blow up is kind of out of character but it isn't that big of a deal.

But when you change things that actually matter it just boggles my mind."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,not Penny's boat tho
A Series of Unfortunate Events,No show on this list is bad imo. Fringe is phenomenal.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Wasn't Lost groundbreaking when it originally aired?
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Fringe is fucking amazing
A Series of Unfortunate Events,I'm pretty sure that in television this is normal.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,…did you even click on the post? The show runners are mentioned pretty early on
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Username checkout
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Yeah, can't fairly judge her. The credited writers just write the first draft after the room creates an outline together and then they revise it together."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,There is so much wrong with this statement I don't even know where to begin.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,[deleted]
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Egos. Film makers that get famous by copying others work will often have huge chips on their shoulders and will go out of their way to change the story just so they can say they made it. Look at GoT, where the show runners insisted it was their story alone and told the actors to not read the books."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"It was, it still is, but it was, too"
A Series of Unfortunate Events,In my experience if the director is doing every episode they want more control. Ive never worked with one who did even most episodes and wasn't a showrunner.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Did you read my comment where I mentioned that the director won't be showrunner?
A Series of Unfortunate Events,*slow clap* Original.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"True, but back in the days of must see watercooler television, there did seem to be a correlation between certain writers and the quality of the episodes. Especially in a show like Lost where show runners Damon and Carlton would write all the Jack-Sawyer-Desmond episodes, Adam and Edward would write the goofier Charlie and Hurley episodes, while temp staff writers like Monica were given leftover episodes."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,The casting call for the role of Artemis was 'an athletic young genius with a heart of gold'. I think that should say enough hahaha
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"The crazy thing about GoT is that doing it that way actually worked pretty well for them earlier on.  While they still had the books to base their stories on, the changes they made actually worked in translating to a new medium.  Combining some characters, streamlining some of the plot, etc.  Once they moved past the source material, their storytelling just completely fell apart."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,Yeah that’s what i thought. I was very confused that this person would call ASOUE ‘superb’ and then LOST just ‘very good.’ There is no comparison to the impact that LOST made.
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Hmm, I see what you're saying. I just meant that the director didn't usually have control in television. Even showrunners usually only direct a few episodes. Interestingly, all of the Marvel Disney+ shows did this."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,*I can italicize my words too*
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Ehhhh when you've read the books and seen the show it becomes much more clear. The changes they made actually weren't that good other than the things done to streamline it somewhat. And even then that same streamlining led to them burning through the book material in no time, leaving them to have to make up more and more towards the end.

They cut out about half of the last two books plot lines, all of them entertaining and important ones too. By the 5th season they had burned through all 5 books, drastically fucking up many of the plots while doing it. Yes it wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either, remember the dorne shit or Arya getting gut stabbed then being fine with some stitches. All that was totally made up and very different from the source material.

Most of what worked was what was true to the material."
A Series of Unfortunate Events,"Lost started superb, and then faltered. “Very good” is it’s average rating."

Little Witch Academia,"Season one is a total of 25 episodes, but Netflix only released the first 12. So surprise! More Little Witch Academia is out there right now! The second half of s1 is great- it really amps up the emotions. Plus you meet one of my favorite characters. "
Little Witch Academia,"A 3 year old? Buddy, you'll be seeing a lot more of season 1 before we ever get to a season 2, if your 3 year old is anything like the one I know."
Little Witch Academia,"So it is a tv series now?  A few months ago I watched what I assumed was a tv series, but ended up being one thirty minute movie.  Later there was a sequel?  It sure felt like a pilot to a tv show, but there was just the one episode."
Little Witch Academia,I might give this a try.
Little Witch Academia,"I found the first ""movie"" to be quite enjoyable, as i felt it kinda played off the whole ""magic school thing"" (basically if harry potter was a girl without some dude trying to kill them)

The second one was kinda a let down as I felt like it took itself too seriously. 

I'm on episode 3 of the series and found it to be just all right so far. Not as good as the first one, but much better than the second ""movie"".

I'll keep watching as I have nothing else to watch at the moment."
Little Witch Academia,It's always seemed interesting. I should really give it a try. How is the dub? Or is it dubbed?
Little Witch Academia,"A three year old can't even process what it's seeing, let alone remember it. 

And it *is* just a shitty generic ""cute girl"" anime. "
Little Witch Academia,I'll pass. Sounds like the next thing a Brony would get into. 
Little Witch Academia,"> fairy tail

Somehow that makes it sound like hentai. 

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
Little Witch Academia,Weeb
Little Witch Academia,"and the excuse they gave to someone on /r/anime is just idiotic. ""They didn't people bingeing it too fast"". Bullshit, that's what their entire service is based on. "
Little Witch Academia,There's the two movies (LWA and Enchanted Parade) and a series. The series is supposed to be a prequel of sorts.
Little Witch Academia,you know there is an anime actually called Fairy Tail right?
Little Witch Academia,the real reason is because they want to release it with their dub and they aren't finished with it yet.
Little Witch Academia,"The series is actually set in a different continuity than the shorter OVAs, since Akko gets the Shiny Rod in different ways in them, and can fly (albeit very haphazardly) in the OVAs"
Little Witch Academia,I was wondering how they went along side each other.
Little Witch Academia,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

Little Witch Academia,"> Blood Blockade Battlefront

I was confused for a second there, then realized thats the English name for Kekkai Sensen."
Little Witch Academia,"Konosuba definitely should be on here for it's hilarious subversion, wherein everyone seems nice but are terrible people"
Little Witch Academia,My Hero Academia is also really excellent.
Little Witch Academia,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Little Witch Academia,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Little Witch Academia,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Little Witch Academia,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia

Little Witch Academia,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Little Witch Academia,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Little Witch Academia,Needs more Jojo
Little Witch Academia,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Little Witch Academia,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Little Witch Academia,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Little Witch Academia,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Little Witch Academia,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Little Witch Academia,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Little Witch Academia,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Little Witch Academia,Madoka magica ! 
Little Witch Academia,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Little Witch Academia,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Little Witch Academia,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."

Little Witch Academia,"Mfw I've seen all of these. I just want to be a fresh weeb again :'(
"
Little Witch Academia,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Little Witch Academia,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Little Witch Academia,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Little Witch Academia,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Little Witch Academia,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Little Witch Academia,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Little Witch Academia,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Little Witch Academia,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Little Witch Academia,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Little Witch Academia,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Little Witch Academia,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Little Witch Academia,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Little Witch Academia,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Little Witch Academia,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Little Witch Academia,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Little Witch Academia,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Little Witch Academia,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Little Witch Academia,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Little Witch Academia,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Little Witch Academia,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Little Witch Academia,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Little Witch Academia,Black Clover?
Little Witch Academia,.
Little Witch Academia,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Little Witch Academia,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Little Witch Academia,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Little Witch Academia,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Little Witch Academia,[deleted]
Little Witch Academia,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Little Witch Academia,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Little Witch Academia,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Little Witch Academia,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Little Witch Academia,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Little Witch Academia,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Little Witch Academia,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Little Witch Academia,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Little Witch Academia,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Little Witch Academia,[deleted]
Little Witch Academia,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Little Witch Academia,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Little Witch Academia,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."

Little Witch Academia,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Little Witch Academia,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Little Witch Academia,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Little Witch Academia,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Little Witch Academia,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Little Witch Academia,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Little Witch Academia,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Little Witch Academia,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Little Witch Academia,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Little Witch Academia,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Little Witch Academia,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Little Witch Academia,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Little Witch Academia,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Little Witch Academia,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,That tattoo make-up must be a pain in the ass.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Deadly serious cop, Quippy black guy, sassy hacker, badass amnesiac with amazing fighting skills, cool boss

this show nails all the tropes"
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"What did you guys think of this? I haven't decided if I want to pick it up because the wiki description of:

> The FBI discovers that each tattoo contains a clue to a crime they will have to solve.

Makes me feel like its going to be yet another cop+NotACopButHasThisInterestingPlotRelatedQuirk show. "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"This, Minority Report and Limitless all seem cut from the same cloth.  Based on a single episode, I'd rank them Blindspot > Limitless > Minority Report.

The mythology for Blindspot also seems to have the most potential 'upside'."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"So, guy just survived a C4 blast. And can hear perfectly fine. The hacker FBI woman can't speak Chinese, but can crack a laptop in Chinese? This show is outta hand with the crazy. "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I tried to watch it, I wanted to like it, but then ""she's a Navy SEAL"" and....I'm done."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I'm not enjoying this at all. It's all clichés and melodrama. I'm willing to put up with leaps in logic and suspending my disbelief, but this show really just goes ""LOL FUCK COMMON SENSE"" and pulls all sorts of unbelievable nonsense.

Putting Kurt Weller in charge of the investigation with his name on her back? Just letting her go with them on a investigation when they know nothing about her just because they *might* need a translator (which of course is a dead giveaway that she will need to translate)?

Everything is *so* overdone and predictable, which alone is pretty off putting. But on top of that, it takes itself *so goddamn seriously*.

It's like they're spending every second of the show sending the message, ""This is all so mysterious! What twist will come next?! MYSTERY!!!"" and driving the point home with a fucking sledgehammer.

EDIT: I gave up at the point they needed her to translate an obscure Chinese dialect, because *of course* the bad guys are speaking a language only she can translate. I spent the last 20 minutes watching Captain Malcom ""Hammer"" Reynolds get saved by a supermodel pretending to be a detective."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Kind of deviant, but I'm so sick of TV cinematography like the kind in this show. It is used in so many shows. It's not unique at all. "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Did this show get leaked or something? Everyone is talking about it already
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,My only complain would be the sassy black guy keeps failing his comedic timing... it is freaking weird. Or must be a new thing... i honestly don't know. 
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"This is definitely my favorite premiere, I cringed a couple times and they made some huge leaps but for a pilot I think it did its job. I expect future episodes to be better and I'm liking Jamie Alexander."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I ended up liking the premiere. My quibble is that far too much of it was spent on arguing whether she should stay behind or not. Other than that, I like what it's setting up, even if the payoff will never be as satisfactory as it was setting it up. "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,The only reason I gave this show a chance was because of Sullivan Stapleton. He was great in Strike back. This show is no Strike back. This show takes itself way too seriously.  An interesting premise but ultimately the show is far fetched and ridiculous.  
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Let's hope this is better than Minority Report's premiere
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Who's the actor that plays the beard guy? 
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"As far as fall TV goes, I'd like to add 1 new show to my list because everything else on it is a returning show. I think I'll DVR this and read the reviews. "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I knew that was Ashley Johnson!  

Generally I thought this was badly directed and written but finally (FINALLY!) someone gets one of those bombs and thinks ""well why don't I just pull these metal bits out of the explosive then it can't go off, or at least remove some of the explosive"". I'm sceptical that pulling those wires out would have set it off but at least they were willing to lie about it rather than pretend it wasn't a possibility "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I want to like it... But the over the top *everything* may be too much.

The cliche style of hacking they use. The little one liners. The absolutely horrendous fight coreography.. 

This is off to a rough start. I'll stick with it though, can't give up on a pilot."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"It seems interesting and I will watch at least the next couple of episodes 

I hope it doesn't become police procedural number 752nd on right now and instead deals with other things. If each tattoo is a different terrorist plot each week it will feel boring, especially as they'll inevitably save everyone at the last minute however I think there's definitely room for growth "
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,So weird/cool hearing Ellie from TLOU on this haha.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I thought the Lead actress was a great, I like the ""mind wiped/Hanna"" storyline. The Dialog was predictable... ""do you ever get tired of being right""? (Groan) Specifically the Dialog between the FBI head and Weller. we care zero about the FBI here. 

If they had let the bomb go off at the end... that would have had me sold, but nope. saved just in time. again. this seems predictable and pedantic.  

If you are going to Create something new, do it. go minimalist. Have something actually happen. the lead character has no frame of reference as to why the Statue of liberty is important, it goes down, everyone else (the entire country) is shocked, she has no feeling one way or the other. she can tell her story out of the scope of recent events, without emotion. that would be different.

you know TV is predictable when you are rooting for the bad guy to succeed, just to see something different.

"
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Oh yay, they took a common tv single episode trope and made it into a series. Meh."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,I've watched 3 episodes so far and it has peaked my interest!
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Ugh, this show. Just ugh. It had so much potential too, especially considering that it's a Greg Berlanti show, and he has had a lot of success lately."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Best show NBC has put out since Hannibal
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Will we ever see tattoos on her breasts and nether region?
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,The main FBI guys teeth are crooked and that annoys me.. but other than that I like the episode
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"She will be wearing a lot of long sleeved shirts haha. Apparently the makeup takes 4 hours, but then it lasts a couple days as long as she's careful!"
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I wonder, if this show gets picked up, will they pull a Prison Break and find a way to ditch it?  Like, ""We've found a way to 3D map and scan all of your tattoos.  Now that we need you to go undercover, we need to laser remove all of your ink."""
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"it's mapped, so they'll probably just keep her clothed 24/7 in future episodes."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Saw an interview with her from last night.  She' said she still had stains in some spots.  Which was part of the reason why she wore the long sleeved high necked dress (on a 100 degree day).
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Not to mention the series is based of the amnesiac that slowly gets their memories back when faced with familiar places/people trope. Most series use it as a 1 episode filler show, but now it has an entire series dedicated to it."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Isn't that 1/3 of every show in the past 15 years? See if you can fill in the blanks to guess the show:

""The protagonist is a ____ and uses the special insight from that to help the ___ solve mysteries""

Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"> Makes me feel like its going to be yet another cop+NotACopButHasThisInterestingPlotRelatedQuirk show.

That is exactly what it is. Just like Limitless (cop + dude who has superbrain), Minority Report (cop + dude who has psychic ability), or Lucifer (cop + dude who is the literal devil). Network tv is so boring and predictable it just makes me sad. And then they wonder why cable and online shows are stealing their viewers."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"The only saving grace the show has from falling into that same cop procedural formula is that it was co-created by Greg Berlanti, who has a pretty good TV track record between Flash and Arrow."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Terribly predictable and full of clichés. Completely ignores even basic common sense frequently. Takes itself way too seriously. Any subtext there was came across about as subtle as [this](https://youtu.be/7KWOzHRwDxs). I was rolling my eyes at least once per scene.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,I like it. My only problem is that they are hinting at her being a SEAL.  I just cant suspend my disbalief that far.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,strongly got the blacklist vibe
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Add Lucifer to that list (I know it doesn't start until midseason), they are all so similar in setup it just makes me sad."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"People who've seen Limitless at ComicCon claim it's way better than the rest of these. I really hope so, because the rest is... yeah."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,limitless is miles better than the other two.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"From what I remember, it was a rare dialect of Chinese. The laptop wasn't in Chinese. Also, she hacked the laptop by attaching a USB stick to the laptop. I'm assuming their was some FBI hacking code to bypass security. The video was in the same Chinese dialect which is why they need Jane to come back up to translate."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Why?
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I think they were kind of guessing at that. It's highly possible that it's another clue that they just haven't figured out yet. But the idea of female special operators isn't THAT far fetched. The flashbacks show some kind of ""Hanna"" style very intense training by an older looking mentor that could explain a few things as well. Of all the ridiculous things, I think her martial/military skills are the least bewildering."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Even if she's not a SEAL, it's possible she's worked with them which gets around the whole ""no women in spec ops jobs"" issue.  Of course the easier go-to would've been ex-CIA."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"And why is the bomber going to the top of the statue? How does that even begin to make sense? You want to destroy it, you place it at the base of it, not the top."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"The thing that annoyed me is how scared and freaked out the bomb guy was with the naked women in a bag, it's not something you see everyday sure but it's New York it could easily been performance art or just a crazy, it's really a story to dine out on."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Now I know I'm **not** going to watch this.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I liked the opening shot of the empty Times Square with the floodlights.

Otherwise it's been unremarkable to look at. Just a lot of cold, dingy lighting and dirty environments."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,This is exactly what I disliked the most about it. It was extremely bland and uncreative
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Yeah, couple of months ago actually. Same with Minority Report, Supergirl, and Lucifer, along with, just a few days ago, Limitless. At this point, leaking the pilot is probably a marketing strategy"
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I watched it on an east coast Canadian channel, which apparently broadcast it 1 hour earlier than US east coast."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Yup. I didn't notice any changes from the leaked version. Minority Report had some changes made from the leaked version though.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Honestly, I would have been okay with them arguing more about it. It was ridiculous how easily they let this unknown entity and VIP go with them."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,My only  problem with him in this is that I'll keep expecting him to be screwing the girl of the day at some point in each episode like Strike Back.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Sullivan Stapleton and Phillip Winchester both have lead roles in network action dramas this fall, but I'm afraid to watch either because I know they'll be nowhere near as entertaining as Strike Back."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Yeah he was so legitimately likable in Strike Back, and that's why I watched that 300 sequel. I'm still not sure if I should watch this one or not though."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,I miss him saying f*ck u Mikey :(
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Same here.  I hope The Player is better.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,People said the same thing about the Blacklist and now it's one of NBC's most popular shows. I think it would be a good idea to pair them together though since it seems like they would share an audience.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Johnny Whitworth
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,So familiar but I can't quite place him.  Really hope someone comes up with an answer.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,Oh my god that was her! Wow and she's in her 30s.

Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,The frustrating thing about Lucifer is that it is based on Neil Gaiman's Lucifer comics and as a result it could be amazing. Instead it is just a snarky british dude with a heart of gold.
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"Oh god why do they keep doing stuff like this. USA changed the perception that a network can't do something new and still do good business when they put out Mr. Robot, why can't these broadcast networks actually put in some effort?"

Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,"I saw the pilots to Limitless, Minority Report, Blindspot,  and lucifer. I thought that Limitless was the best pilot out of the 4, however,  it was nearly a tie between Blindspot and Limitless.   

Blindspot reminded me too much of John Doe(a show I loved) that it seemed kinda unoriginal when I watched it,  which is why I put Limitless above it.   

Both were leagues better than Minority Report and lucifer. "

A)  It's pretty far fetched.  

B)  Even if that weren't the case, her character projects nothing to lead me to believe she could have even passed selection, let alone completed training."
Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan and Jane,This is the point of the show when it lost it for me.  They find out Chow is angry because his Mom was killed in  Chinese prison and the Weller immediately links it to the State of Liberty.   Really?

One Day at a Time,"Pat Harrington had been a popular sketch comic and character actor going back into the 1950s, so the audience would be primed to view any character he played as goofy rather than threatening."
One Day at a Time,"Nit quite creepy more goofy, yet over confident of his ladies man status kinda like Larry Dallas mixed with Mr. Furley from Three's Company."
One Day at a Time,"No, he wasn’t intended to be creepy at the time, just another case of viewing an old show through a modern lens as you noted."

I thought the reboot did a good job of updating the character in a way that honored the origins while making him a more believable friend to the family."
One Day at a Time,Has OP ever seen Seinfeld and know who Kramer was?
One Day at a Time,[deleted]
One Day at a Time,No. He was funny.
One Day at a Time,"I think he was supposed to be a regular sort of ""thinks he's more charming than he is but otherwise very harmless and funny character"", but I find him SO creepy. I was literally watching the show just a few hours ago and there was a plot about one character pursuing him but him not wanting her, and I was just like ""ew, why"". 

The reboot has their Schneider also just sort of inviting himself in sometimes, but it comes off way less creepy for some reason. I think on the original part of it might be because Ann is sort of a doormat, like you get the feeling Schneider could decide to just live on their couch and Ann would be like ""Oh... okay."""
One Day at a Time,">I know I am watching the show through the lens of today and the show was written back in the 1970s

L&S had the characters of Lenny & Squiggy always barging into L&S's apartment. Usually ""on cue"" (example: Laverne might say to Shirley something like, ""If there are two people on Earth more pathetic than us, I'd like to meet them!,"" and the door would slam open and Lenny and Squiggy would walk in with Squiggy's weird voice yelling, ""HELLOOOOOO!"")."

One Day at a Time,">In the past you had the freedom to be a complete creepy weirdo and still be allowed on TV. Now they pretend these marginalized individuals don't exist or worse that they are somehow all behind bars.

You appear to be looking at this from Schneider's perspective, but creepiness doesn't exist in a vacuum. He is actively making other people uncomfortable, and potentially threatened. At the time of the show's creation, this behavior was societally tolerated, but the basic comedic premise even then hinged upon his behavior existing in this grey area between ""not really OK"" and ""completely unacceptable"". I would argue that this points to him being *the person doing the marginalizing*, rather than the marginalized one, himself.

Additionally, there were judgments made on that show that reflected very negatively on *previous* modes of social operation from e.g. the 1940's and before. To argue that the 1970's represent an idyllic time where the freedom to be a creep hadn't yet been repealed is to a) imply that being a creep is OK and b) that the 1970's represent something more than the subjective place that you seem to have pinned your barometer for social acceptability."

One Day at a Time,"Is he...?? Shit, I did not know that, thank you very much.."
One Day at a Time,"Dang, he’s the guy that helped make all the other roles so good."
One Day at a Time,Antique roadshow was a great episode
One Day at a Time,Veneer!
One Day at a Time,"Both of those episodes are incredible!  
“VENEER!”"
One Day at a Time,"Is that the one where Roz wears a blonde wig, and then Kenny comes in and breaks it up?  That is a great episode."
One Day at a Time,You can see it just in the change in titles.
One Day at a Time,/r/Factorial
One Day at a Time,"For the large percentage of reddit users without English as their first language, yeah it can be hard"
One Day at a Time,It’s what you end up with after crohn’s surgery.
One Day at a Time,They should look upon a title like this as an opportunity to improve their skills.  Puzzle it out & learn.  Don’t rely on the host language to dumbitself down for them.  JFC
One Day at a Time,"Understandable, but still silly to complain about when it’s grammatically correct (as far as I can tell), and also not /r/titlegore worthy."
One Day at a Time,"sometimes you see a reddit cliche. in this case, the title is extremely bad. and the cliche is that someone is calling it out and in lots of these types of threads someone comments something like this. i was just pointing it out, but it’s not very funny lol"
One Day at a Time,"No, good points. I stand corrected."
One Day at a Time,"He was on Bob Saget's podcast ""Bob Saget is Here For You"" a few months ago (via Zoom). Still going strong."
One Day at a Time,That’s because he doesn’t email you constantly lol
One Day at a Time,CA-CHING!
One Day at a Time,THEY ARE ALL GREAT EPISODES
One Day at a Time,r/unexpectedfactorial is the actual sub name my man
One Day at a Time,"You'd think, but on reddit, it's always the title and the author of said title that is wrong. 'My ability to read and comprehend is without fault.'"
One Day at a Time,"By your ridiculous logic, nobody should use proper punctuation ever. That way, everyone will have perfect punctuation from all the ""opportunities"" they got to ""puzzle it out"".

Besides, how do you know you're puzzling it out right if you don't know what's correct in the first place? Nobody's learning shit from this. It's just muddying the waters."
One Day at a Time,"I agree with you on that completely, sucks that proper grammar sounds/looks so wrong sometimes."
One Day at a Time,"Zero mention of his role in the first few shows, but they decide to credit him as creator and writer for the last one, without separating those two points with any punctuation whatsoever.

Title gore doesn't mean nobody understands what it's trying to say. It just means it's poorly written and potentially confusing."
Star,He had such a strong screen presence. RIP
Star,I loved Reddick in Fringe. Such great presence for the role. RIP
Star,"What the fuck? Condolences to his family. Between The Wire, Fringe, John Wick and Horizon Zero Dawn, he’s been in a lot of my favorite media.

RIP to a real police"
Star,"He was just announced a few weeks ago as playing Zeus in the Percy Jackson series. Horrible, horrible news."
Star,"Fuck sakes, really?"
Star,"“Anything else Mr. Wick?”  
  
Phenomenal actor. He'll be truly missed."
Star,"Titans, we must carry on. RIP to our Vanguard. Such a talented actor."
Star,"Damn, RIP Cinder King"
Star,"This. Is BULL*SHIT*.

Rest in peace, Lance."
Star,"I don't know that I've ever had more of a ""*gasp* what?!"" response to a death announcement before.

this is so out of nowhere and he kicked so much ass. this sucks."
Star,"According to Law Enforcement, it was natural causes:

>Law enforcement sources tell TMZ ...  Lance's body was discovered at his Studio City home Friday morning around 9:30 AM. His cause of death is currently unclear, but our law enforcement sources say it appears to be natural.

RIP"
Star,"holy shit WHAT

he was great on Fringe"
Star,Loved him as Colonel Broyles in Fringe.
Star,He has one of the best skits on the Eric Andre show too
Star,"Sad day for any Destiny fan.  A legend for his role in The Wire.  He was on cast for the Percy Jackson reboot too.

RIP."
Star,I was just Playing Horizon Forbidden West a couple of days ago and thinking of all the shows he's been in that I like.
Star,"Oh my gosh this is so heartbreaking. 

The guy was amazing in literally every role I ever seen him in.

Props to his absolutely amazing Eric Andre guest spot!

RIP to a legit legend"
Star,"He'll get praise for his other works but he was pretty fuckin hilarious in the show Corporate.  
As a late comer to the Wire, my first time seeing him was the season 4 premiere of Lost where he left quite an impression."
Star,Seeing him in Wick 4 next week will be sad now
Star,☹ loved him in Bosch...
Star,"That sucks so bad, the guy was a legend. I'm watching Fringe as I read this."
Star,No Sylens.... RIP
Star,Natural Po-lice. Fucking gutted man the man was a fantastic actor with incredible presence. From Oz and the Wire to Fringe and John Wick he always delievered.
Star,"A lot of his high points are rightly discussed. 

I want to mention, _Corporate_, a really small sitcom that ran for 3 seasons and was hilarious. He was excellent as the big honcho, playing it completely straight in this goofy comedy and stealing his scenes. Great actor!"
Star,Rip Zavala :(
Star,noooo   ........ im gutted.......
Star,"What... I can't believe it. He was the best part of the Resident Evil show by a landslide, that's the first thing I've ever watched him in. Just a great actor and very charismatic, can't believe he died so young. Rest in peace..."
Star,Just bingeing Fringe again at this moment and saw this whilst briefly scrolling. Great presence.
Star,"Seeing him first in Lost, then Fringe, then hearing his distinctive voice in Destiny and Horizon, aw man RIP 😭"
Star,He was great on the Comedy Central show Corporate
Star,"This is so sudden, damn.

He has such an iconic voice and charisma.

I also had no idea he was 60."
Star,"Rest in peace chief 😞

He was fantastic, I thought my wife was pranking me ffs."
Star,I’m fucking gutted. Commander Zavala :(
Star,"The Wire, Fringe, even a bit role in Lost.  Great actor, gone way way way too soon.  RIP."
Star,So weird. He *just* posted yesterday chilling with his dogs.
Star,I hope he finally gets his iconic slave role warp speed don’t Reading Rainbow him!
Star,Well my day is officially ruined. Fuck
Star,"So out of nowhere, and he was only 60? What the fuck.."
Star,"He will be missed. When an artist dies young, it feels like the world has been robbed of their talent. As others have said: The Wire, Fringe, Horizon, John Wick...you know what all of those would be without Lance? Not as good."
Star,That's way too young.
Star,Fuck this hits hard. Cedric was great.
Star,"Oh man, that absolutely sucks. He was always the type of guy I’d sit up for when he popped into something. Very sad to hear this one :("
Star,"This is so unbelievably sad. He added a level of professionalism and class to every character he played that was unparalleled in his genre. Rest In Peace, you won’t be forgotten."
Star,"We just lost Michael K. Williams, now Lance too?  And both way too young..."
Star,"What the heck man?!  He is awesome, has majors roles in the John Wick movies, he was a major character in the Horizon games x 2, and also he was the main character in the Resident Evil Netflix show.  What a loss.  RIP."
Star,"Funny how different community know him by different roles..

/r/television - The Wire, Fringe, Oz, Lost

/r/PS5 - Horizon games

/r/XboxSeriesX - Destiny, Quantum Break

/r/movies - John Wick and Wire


Same article showing up on different communities but the title reflects how they know him best."
Star,"[""Bing bang boom, dick titties""](https://youtu.be/76CQptAL9pM&t=0m49s)


[Rip Agent Clappers](https://youtu.be/d-n81Pl-zm0)"
Star,I know it’s probably been mentioned but he was great in Fringe. RIP
Star,"60!! Wtf, that’s heartbreaking. I always got excited when I saw him in a role. He really added strength to the characters he played. Gonna rewatch Fringe in his honor"
Star,"Well fudge.  RIP Zavala, may your light always shine on!"
Star,"Damn. I just watched the Toys R Me Funny or Die skit he did a few days back:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GU-2C8Ec6co"
Star,"A damn shame.  He killed it in every role he had, regardless of medium."
Star,Literally watching fringe as I read this ..
Star,God fucking damn
Star,"Fucking what. God damn it, today sucks. Reddick was great in everything I've seen him in, this is a huge loss."
Star,"My god this shocked me. How awful, he still had a lot to give. Rest in peace sir, god this was way too soon."
Star,His deadpan delivery as the hotel manager was what sold the John Wick film as humor and not just action. He also voiced the dragon in Vox Machina season 2.
Star,"Truly heartbreaking news. I've been a fan since I saw him on Fringe nearly 15 years ago. He was great on there. And then of course he was incredible on The Wire (only watched it for the first time a few years ago). Not to mention how versatile he was, because of course he's in the John Wick movies, but he played one of my favorite characters in the Horizon video game franchise. What a loss. Condolences to his loved ones. 😔"
Star,He’s so amazing in ‘Corporate’ on Comedy Central. Dude had range.
Star,Dude never got his iconic slave role. :(
Star,"I don't usually get emotional over celebrity deaths but this one hurts. Gonna go watch The Wire for a bit. RIP Lance, thank you for all your work."
Star,Fuck today
Star,He had the best strut. RIP Lance
Star,"No, no, no. Love this actor.  Hollywood just suffered a massive loss. 😢"
Star,"Fuck. I've just been rewatching Fringe, which he's so good in."
Star,"Damn shame. He had that ""cool factor"" that most people just don't."
Star,"He seemed to play the same character over and over again, but that was okay because that character was AWESOME."
Star,"He was a phenomenal actor who crushed it in tons of different roles across movies, TV, and video games, but I will always think of The Wire when I think of Lance Reddick. He actually read for the parts of both McNulty and Bubbles before the producers asked him to come back and read for Daniels. It's hard to imagine how different the show would have been if he'd been playing one of those characters instead of Daniels, but that just speaks to how iconic his performance was.

RIP Mr. Reddick. You will be missed."
Star,"Whoa..

I just finished rewatching Fringe, a towering presence among the series that influenced me growing up; I hadn’t revisited the series since it ended.

I’d totally forgotten that originally, his role was positioned as sort of just another “overbearing superior who demands results but underestimates the heroes”-type character, not unlike Agent Skinner from The X-Files (Fringe’s chief inspiration).

But almost immediately, this characterization in the pilot disappears in subsequent episodes. Instead, Agent Broyles defies the archetype and proves a capable leader who genuinely cares about his people. Lance Reddick brought so much complexity and emotion to a character that, despite a hardened, sometimes cold exterior, had a warmth and sense of vulnerability that made him so much more.

I wish he hadn’t been pigeonholed into roles seemingly written as “Lance Reddick-types,” but I’ll always remember seeing him take what could’ve been just a gag, and turn it into a brilliant performance of hilarious euphoria and wonder, followed by existential crisis and finally total emotional vulnerability when, in a later season, Broyles is accidentally dosed with LSD.

RIP

Star,"Jesus that’s terrible news, such a great actor. I’ve never seen him give a bad performance."
Star,"Haven't watched The Wire yet (I know), but his arc on Oz was great! RIP"
Star,"Literally just finished watching the wire for the first time.

RIP"
Star,Terrible news:( RIP
Star,60 is far too young.
Star,"He made Corporate, his cold steely way of saying the most absurd things was so funny.

Really sad to hear this"
Star,He was great in Corporate too
Star,"Just watched the first John wick last night after thinking I should re-watch all 3 to get in the mood for chapter 4 & I think besides John my favourite character is Charon, Lance just had such a presence whether it be something so simple as him saying hello to JW or him calling his room to tell JW the hotel has had a noise complaint.

The John Wick franchise will be a little less awesome now that Lance is gone. RIP"
Star,I loved him in Fringe and was looking forward to seeing him in the Percy Jackson franchise. So shocking and sad. And only 60?! :(
Star,"Ahh man! Lance had one of the smoothest voices in Hollywood, and his presence on screen was undeniably cool. He will definitely be missed. 

I was already planning a John Wick movie marathon this weekend, looks like there’s an even stronger reason to rewatch now. The Continental will not be as cool without him."
Star,RIP to a legend. “Bend to far you’re already broken.”
Star,He was great in Fringe
Star,Just finished a rewatch of the Wire. RIP Daniels.
Star,"No way!! What the fuck?!

Awful news, he was fantastic. Rest in power Lance."
Star,Damn. I just started watching Fringe a couple weeks ago. His performance was superb. We lost one of the greats today. RIP.
Star,"Crazy how I was just rewatching the wire am at the second episode, look at Reddit for a moment then see this. His voice is so recognisable in some games too. He did a awesome job in Horizon. Not to mention the movies he has been in."
Star,"WHAT THE FUCK!!!
my god this news just breaks my heart!! i just started watching the tv series ""Fringe"" a couple of weeks ago (i'm already well into season 2!) and i love it!
60 years old is not old! i just stunned and wrecked at this news. Mr. Reddick was EXTREMELY talented! he was an excellent actor.

my condolences to his family, friends and fellow fans.
RIP"
Star,"OMG ! I last saw him on resident evil and despite many people here tank the show. I enjoyed it especially Lance Reddick performance. He did a few roles and did them well.

Also 60 is very young and I always wonder what is the meaning of death by natural causes. 60 is not natural."
Star,I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THIS!
Star,"I'm not even sad about this, I'm angry. Guy seemed healthy as a horse and he's much younger than my parents. 60 is too fucking young to just die of natural causes. It's such a 'fuck you' that it ever happens. 


Great actor in every role I've seen him in. Even if he never got his iconic slave role like Levar Burton. RIP."
Star,Gone too soon. Can't believe it. may he rest in peace.
Star,"He was just promoting his new movie.  Had to Google this after I saw this headline and it is very jarring to see this news alongside an article of him doing a very recent interview. 

Wow.  RIP"
Star,"I gave this lovely man a twice weekly Covid test in October,2021. HBO studio out in the Valley. Told him I loved The Wire, he told me to watch Bosch. I was impressed by his calm gracious vibe.RIP."
Star,Noooo!  I loved him!
Star,"Aw man this sucks. His presence in the Wire was incredibly powerful, I don't think anyone could have played his role like him. He will be missed."
Star,Fuuuuuuuuck. I always wanted him to take over as the host of jeopardy.
Star,"Damn so young. Amazing actor and amazing voice.

I wonder what they’ll do for the third Horizon game. Hopefully he recorded some lines."
Star,RIP legend
Star,No!  Always loved him.  What terrible news.
Star,So many amazing roles but he’ll always be the boss in Corporate for me. Absolutely hilarious performance. Please check it out if you haven’t seen it. RIP.
Star,I was just watching “Fringe” last night
Akagi,Cartoons about sports? No thanks.
Akagi,"I'm about halfway through season two of Haikyuu right now and I'm really enjoying it. I love how despite the necessary bending of time for the sake of story and character, they do as much as possible to ground the show in real tactics and explains itself and volleyball to the audience. Because of the writing the show could probably succeed with a much less realistic portrayal of sport but the fact that they put the effort in makes it that much better for me."
Akagi,No *Prince of Tennis* here?
Akagi,"Soccer also has:

- ""Area no Kishi"" (The Knight in the Area) 
- ""Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun"" (Clean Freak! Aoyama-kun)

I don't know if they are on any streaming service or not since I don't use any."
Akagi,">Eyeshield 21

I really liked this show.  It was fun, exciting, funny. It showed an understanding of what makes American football a good sport.  Good depiction of why team sports in general bond diverse people together, even opponents.  Great depiction of how even if you have amazing talent you will need an insane amount of work to get anywhere."
Akagi,"I'll add a few more that you missed out:

# Football/soccer

**Aoki Densetsu Shoot!** *\[No official stream\]*

58 episodes and 1 short movie. No English dub.

>This anime is based on the manga, ""Shoot!"", which was published between 1990 and 2003. It won the 1994 Kodansha Manga Award for Shounen. The anime adaptation was broadcast from 1993 to 1994 and thus, does not cover the entirety of the manga. It tells the story of Tanaka Toshihiko (""Toshi"") and his 2 friends, Hiramatsu Kazuhiro and Shiraishi Kenji, who played football together during middle school and were known as the Kakenishi Middle School's Golden Trio, and now they have graduated to high school. In high school though, it's only Toshi who continues to play football. His 2 friends have dropped out of football due to their personal circumstances. They are still in the same high school, Kakegawa High School. The reason that Toshi joined Kakegawa High School is because of his football idol, Kubo Yoshiharu, who plays there. The portrayal of football in this anime is a bit more down to Earth compared with Captain Tsubasa, the preeminent football anime then. It is a contemporary of the basketball anime, Slam  Dunk.

**Hungry Heart: Wild Striker** *\[No official stream\]*

52 episodes. No English dub.

>This anime came out in 2002 at roughly the same time as the manga. It is the creation of Takahashi Youichi (the creator of Captain Tsubasa). Created to tap into the interest in football to tie-in with the 2002 World Cup jointly hosted by Japan and South Korea. The story is about Kanou Kyosuke, a teenage high school student, whose older brother, Kanou Seisuke, is a top Japanese professional football player that plays for A.C. Milan (they were giants in European football then). His older brother taught him how to play and love football but he finds himself being regularly compared to his older brother by others. This pressure of expectation made him lose his passion in the game. This anime covers his path back to find that passion again.

**Whistle!** *\[No official stream\]*

39 episodes. No English dub.

>Based on the manga of the same name. The English-translated manga is published by Viz Media. There are 24 volumes in total. The manga/anime is about a middle school boy named Kazamatsuri Sho who dreams of becoming a professional football player. However, he is short and not that good at it but he does have a passion for it and works hard to improve himself. He makes it into Musashi no Mori Junior High School which hosts a top class football team but he is way down the order. He transfers to Sakura Josui Junior High School to have a better chance to make it into the football team there. The school is not known for football but does have a football team there. When the Sakura Josui football team hears that he transferred in from Musashi no Mori, there were high expectations of him but he could not deliver those expectations. The anime covers his determination to improve himself and to defy the odds for a short player. It's a show that espouses positive values.

# Baseball

**Mix** *\[Funimation\]*

24 episodes. English dub available.

>This is the anime adaptation of Adachi Mitsuru's manga of the same name. The manga is still under serialisation with a monthly release of chapters. This manga is set in the same world as Adachi's classic manga, ""Touch"", but 25-26 years after. It is not necessary to have watched the older series. For those who have, it's like slipping into a pair of comfy home slippers. The story revolves around the 2 Tachibana brothers, Souichirou and Touma,  and their younger sister, Otomi. The 2 bothers are step-brothers to each other but it so happens that they were born on the same date and at approx. the same time (to different mothers, of course). The older brother, Souichirou, and the younger sister are from the maternal side, while the 2nd brother, Touma, is from the fraternal side. They are good at baseball with Souichirou being an excellent catcher and Touma being an excellent pitcher. They make a formidable battery. This is their story from late middle school to early high school. For those familiar with Adachi's works, this is very typical Adachi with his quirks in full display.

**H2** *\[No official stream\]*

41 episodes. No English dub.

>Another anime adaptation of a Adachi Mitsuru manga. This is an earlier manga than ""Mix"" but a later one than ""Touch"". The manga ran from 1992 to 1999. The anime adaptation ran from 1995 to 1996. This series revolves around the competition between Kunimi Hiro, a pitcher, and Tachibana Hideo, 3rd base and 4th batter. In middle school, together with their catcher and friend, Noda Atsushi, their middle school team won the national championships consecutively. However, both Kunimi Hiro and Noda Atsushi were diagnosed with career-ending sports injuries before high school. Thus, the both of them enrolled in Senkawa High School, a high school with no baseball team so that they would not be reminded of not being able to play baseball anymore, whereas Tachibana Hideo enrolled in Meiwa Daiichi High School, a high school with a powerhouse baseball team. Early in their high school life, it turns out Kunimi's and Noda's injuries were wrongly diagnosed and that they are in good health to continue playing baseball. They now decide to form a baseball team in Senkawa to continue their baseball career. The title, ""H2"", relates to the initials of their first name, Hiro and Hideo. It also relates to the initials of the first name of the 2 girls, Amamiya Hikari and Koga Haruka, who are a core part of this series. Amamiya Hikari is the neighbourhood childhood friend of Hiro that Hiro matchmakes with Hideo during primary school years while Haruka is the girl who has a passion for baseball in Senkawa."
Akagi,People who like sports and people who like anime are not overlapping categories.
Akagi,[removed]
Akagi,"Tbh heard some bad things about Prince of Tennis especially with the super powers on display, tried to aim more towards the grounded shows."
Akagi,"Yeah there's tons more football ones, it actually gets a bit overwhelming so thought I'd limit it to the more interesting ones. Personally I found Clean Freak! to be really hard to watch."
Akagi,"Really? Someone should tell that to my volleyball club then, most of our post game chats are anime."
Akagi,[removed]
Akagi,"The more ridiculous the sports anime, the more interested I'd be."
Akagi,Volleyball. Ok
Akagi,[removed]
Akagi,"Is that not a sport now? There's lads in my 6-a-side team who watch anime as well, and you see tons of crossover on reddit.

Seems like you're just being dismissive for reasons I can't comprehend, is there really much fun in being objectively wrong?"
Akagi,[removed]
Akagi,"Dude. You get what I’m saying. These aren’t aligning demographics. 

People aren’t raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime."
Akagi,">People aren’t raging about the NFL or formula 1 then popping on some random anime.

I am, am I not people? It's often the stress reliever I need after watching a stressful match, unless I'm watching down the pub where a few pints does the same job. 

You just seem to have a very rigid view of the things people enjoy tbh."
Akagi," I personally don't like anime much at all and love sports however there are a ton of NFL Players that watch a ton of anime, as well as NBA players. Im thinking its a generation thing, so I think they overlap a bit a more than people realize but yeah def not widespread."
Akagi,wat
Akagi,So Neon Genesis Evangelion is hot garbage?
Akagi,"> 13 Reasons Why is the Western Neon Genesis Evangelion

You mean the trashy show people like because it's the only remotely intelligent thing they experience in their worthless lives? From the synopsis sounds about right, really."
Akagi,"Theres a Netflix show called ""13 reasons why"" about a girl who committed suicide. "
Akagi,"[Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion)
>Evangelion is an apocalyptic anime, set in a futuristic Tokyo fifteen years after a worldwide cataclysm. The story centers on Shinji, a teenage boy who is recruited by his father into the shadowy organization NERV to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha called an Evangelion in combat against monstrous beings known as Angels.

wat"
Akagi,"oh, this makes more sense now"
Akagi,"I haven't (and don't plan on) watched 13 reasons why, but I think OP is going for something like ""Eastern teen angst is the same as Western teen angst, and similar character tropes exist an depictions of either"" 

Also shinji is a bitch"
Akagi,"I agree completely. Also, Shinji is a bitch and a self absorbed little whiny prick who's awkwardly creepy towards literally every female character in the anime that has an interaction with him longer than 5 seconds. Your father being a douche does not justify you wanking over Asuka's unconscious body, kid. Eww."
Beyond,"I've been watching this show. It's so hilariously bad and it's gotten so much worse. I've never seen a show exude more of a ""and then and then and then and then"" than this one. It has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, too. Given where it's at in Season 2 Episode 12, there shouldn't be more than 6 more episodes at all but the last minute ""twist"" probably is responsible for that."
Beyond,Why?
Beyond,"It's OK, nobody is asking for this."
Beyond,"I like the show, even with all of its flaws."
Beyond,don't watch it but has anyone see the sleestacks yet????
Beyond,6 is enough just finish it
Beyond,Has Natalie Zea ever been in a good show?
Beyond,"Whole show is amateur hour. 

I bet Jon seda wished he'd stayed on PD."
Beyond,"What if?.. in Season 3 the writing starts to ramp exponentially and we get the best network Sci-Fi feature since Lost, confounding even the most ardent of La Brea critics? Hey, I know it may be hard to fix  ummmm.. multiple.. plot holes from the prev seasons, but I do enjoy it."
Beyond,I haven't watched more than a couple episodes of season two but I appreciate how it just doesn't follow any logic.  Like how they have been there for I don't know how long and they have yet to show any survival skills.
Beyond,Since the hiatus it's just been boring rather than entertainingly stupid. Which is why it's getting the axe.
Beyond,Still not as bad as manifest
Beyond,"Just let me see the end of Lost ""at home"""
Beyond,"It's funny you say that because at some point they ""sort of"" address that but what was used to introduce that concept became a plot device.

Also, they randomly have convenient products show up throughout the season as long as it benefits the plot. It's hilarious."
Beyond,"Maybe now that X is dead, all of the palace intrigue will be over and done with, which was an absolute slog. 

The outside location stuff is what makes it fun."
Beyond,"Nah on scale of badness Manifest is just poor man's La Brea or La Brea at home.

&#x200B;

Seriously Manifest was NEVER as bad as La Brea."
Beyond,I liked when there was the snowstorm and they just happened to find a costume truck that had coats in it.
Beyond,I know. Somebody needs medicine. Bro just go to the bus there's everything from A to Z lmao.
Beyond,Yes it was the whole death date and Noah’s ark
Beyond,"Something similar but way less dire happens later in the season lol

The show just gives 0 fucks at all about logic."
Beyond,Are you referring to that wedding episode?
Beyond,"Yep, that is exactly the one lol"

Frieren will be voiced by Atsumi Tanezaki (Anya in SPYxFAMILY, Vivy in Vivy: Fluorite Eye’s Song and Chise in The Ancient Magis Bride)

synopsis: >!The demon king has been defeated, and the victorious hero party returns home before disbanding. The four—mage Frieren, hero Himmel, priest Heiter, and warrior Eisen—reminisce about their decade-long journey as the moment to bid each other farewell arrives. But the passing of time is different for elves, thus Frieren witnesses her companions slowly pass away one by one. Before his death, Heiter manages to foist a young human apprentice called Fern onto Frieren. Driven by the elf's passion for collecting a myriad of magic spells, the pair embarks on a seemingly aimless journey, revisiting the places that the heroes of yore had visited. Along their travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed opportunities to form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.!< (fyi: this is not an isekai, it’s a fantasy/adventure story)

Frieren won the Taisho Manga award in 2021, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for Best New Work and ranked 2nd and 6th in the This Manga is Amazing! annual magazine in 2021 and 2022 respectively."
Beyond,"Reading the manga now. Really looking forward to this. The MC ages slowly so its very interesting seeing her treat the world like there is a infinite amount of time, especially when she’s traveling with normal humans. LotR’s tried to do this in Rings of Power with their elves, but this does it way better IMO.

Really looking forward to this."
Beyond,"Meh more moe garbage. Anime is dead in the water now.

Go watch Velma if you want a far better piece of animation"

Beyond,Can't wait for this one.

But seriously the manga is such a treat you actually miss the characters that come in and out of the story.  And the slow walking pace of the characters.  I am trying to keep my expectations low as if I over hype I will be disappointed."
Beyond,"I loved it, but mainly because of Jack. I can't imagine anyone else playing him. One last season with a relatively happy/hopeful ending would be great."
Beyond,All hail Special Agent Jack Bauer
Beyond,"24 was such an excellent show (mostly, anyway) and I generally believe anything that is excellent can work in pretty much any era."
Beyond,"24 would work better today than it did back when it was released.

First, you can run it without commercials, which makes the 'real-time' aspect work much better.

Second, you can make it shorter and not cover 24 hours, do 10-12 instead. This gets rid of most of the plausibility issues, questions like ""when do they eat"", etc."
Beyond,"I think these days it would be come under fire for being 'racist', even though it wasnt.  
  

A white special agent breaking the law by torturing minorities would be a tough sell for 2023 regardless of context"
Beyond,Yes as long as the writing is decent and Keifer is back. They need 1 more season with a happy ending
Beyond,"I think elements of it would need polishing. I'm not really sure many outlets are capable of a 24 episode season on that level anymore.

And even the first run never really regained the heights of the first 12 hours. The efforts to find new perils for for Kim to Breast her way Boobily through started feel a lot like Penelope Pitstop, and you could pinpoint the exact moment they had to start winging the plot overall. There was also a very strange political turn part of the ways in, when suddenly the answer to every question always seemed to be torture?"
Beyond,"NEW 24 SHOW FOR 2024!

It would work just fine, I am not sure they need 24 episodes anymore per season. Respect to Corey Hawkins however he wasn’t an actual movie star like Kiefer was, they need star power. The first name coming to mind is Liam Hemsworth as New Jack, instead of doing The Witcher"
Beyond,"No, he died in 2008. 21 could still work though."
Beyond,"There’s a pretty strong case to be made that 24 and shows/movies  like it existed and still exist today in no small part to improve public opinion of the US military and government use of force in general. 

24 in particular is a pretty shameless propaganda tool for promoting that “enhanced interrogation techniques” are justifiable - it literally hinges on the absurd “ticking clock scenario” that Bush Administration officials often cited at the time as why torture needed to be an available tool. I mean it’s no coincidence lawmakers at the time literally invoked 24 and Jack Bauer in their arguments to support many elements of the so-called War on Terror.

That said the practice didn’t start with 24 nor did it end with 24. So maybe with a few adjustments I imagine a show with such a strong premise would be popular today - especially now that serialized storytelling is the expectation. But as some have also said I think the biggest constraint would be the 24 episodes. Nobody makes seasons that long anymore even on network television."
Beyond,It would be far more negative of such an agency in today's climate. They would be the villains of a show today not the heroes.
Beyond,It would need a hard reboot. Get back the realtime and cliffhanger concept.
Beyond,"The bad guys came from every corner of the earth. So it was pretty woke for the time.

 Russian separatists, Cartel members, extra evil Julian Assange clone, African warlords, corrupt politicians, and Islamic extremists.  Even domestic terrorists were on the show.

There isn't anything really controversial about the show.  It's a pretty generic cop show formula about blurring personal morals to catch a bad guy.  What made it great was the orchestral soundtrack, characters you can get attached to, plot twists, and the real-tme storyline.

Definitely axe Kim Bauer though."
Beyond,"it would work, but it will be ruined by the current idiotic outrage culture and in order to avoid the twitter mud slinging, companies would eviscerate the concept, sanitise it to hell and beyond, insert a trillion virtue signalling shit like an empowered female Bauer who is exactly like him but better therefore making it 24 in name only, a bland, socioculturally modern jack of all trades garbage ass show that satisfies noone. Better leave it in the past. Is it a bit fascist? Yes, but so is Homeland and that one didn't get lambasted for being one of the biggest USA fanfare machines ever"
Beyond,"In it's tried and true format? Absolutely not.

You wouldn't be able to find any network that would commission 24 episodes of an 1-hour drama.

You'd have to cut it down to 10-12 episode, which then means you have to rethink the entire hour by hour concept."
Beyond,Too much content. If it came back it would be 10 episodes max and they would wonder why it failed.
Beyond,Anytime. Anywhere. But KS has to be Jack.
Beyond,(Twenty Twenty-three)
Beyond,That’s exactly what 24: Legacy was. One season without Jack and a relatively happy ending. It wasn’t a great show though
Beyond,"Okay never watched it, but would the season be where he is somewhere far away while his first grandchild is being born - and he has to arrive within 24 hours to ministrate his grandfatherly duties?


otherwise, son-in-law's father that he hates will do the first grandfatherly activities"
Beyond,Love Jack Bauer. One of the greatest and one of my fav characters.
Beyond,"That’s what they did with the revival of it IIRC, and I think the final season they explored having it be one day but it was only 12 episodes."
Beyond,At like 10 hours they should be able to tighten the plot and get rid of a lot of the filler storylines too.
Beyond,"It’s so bizarre looking back at quotes from politicians and celebrities about that show and how they glorified Jack in a pretty disturbing way like that. 

Still love the show though."
Beyond,">I think these days it would be come under fire for being 'racist', even though it wasnt.  

It was already under fire back then. Not for for the racism, as the show went out of it's way not to play into the Muslim stereotypes, at least for while. The villains mostly weren't Muslim and they introduced positive Muslim agents, showing anti-Muslim riots as ignorant. 

Yes, for anyone who thinks being woke and PC is new, Fox and 24 openly cared and tried not to perpetuate negative stereotypes back in 2001. 

The main criticism was glorification of authoritarian state tactics, particularly torture. People correctly pointed out that simply having Bauer solve problems by torturing people and violating rights wasn't a great message, and was also unrealistic. People under torture can and do simply give bad Intel. You can make them talk, but not be honest. The show eventually did address this. 

Race wasn't criticized as much as sexism, due to the terrible writing of female characters fitting into one or two tropes. Kim in particular for much is season 2 was a Perils of Pauline plotline that got increasingly pointless and silly."
Beyond,"Do you agree with Jack’s penchant for torture in the name of national security even when there’s little to no evidence that it will help?

Somewhat loaded question and it’s one of my all-time favorite shows, but at a certain point I personally think it seemed more like a crutch they leaned on time and time again."
Beyond,"It's more of a trick Hollywood uses to get law enforcement agencies to eagerly donate resources.  Easy way to get a show green lit.

CTU was basically a fictional (more action oriented) version of the Dept of Homeland Security.  So the government would be eager to loan em resources like shooting locations and cop cars."
Beyond,Network dramas with seasons of 20+ episodes are still a thing...and pretty popular.
Beyond,"He had a cameo on its always sunny in Philadelphia and it was puuurfect! 

For real though the reboot they did was solid I totally think it would work."
Beyond,"Yeah, like... for a while the gimmick was that these guys were being placed in impossible dilemmas they had no choice but to decide on anyway. But then it started to feel like the writing was starting with torture and working back to the thing it would take to justify it?"
Beyond,"> Do you agree with Jack’s penchant for torture in the name of national security even when there’s little to no evidence that it will help?

i mean it's pretty obvious it helped him in the context of the show."
Beyond,"Yes - but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s sponsored propaganda. That’s what they get money for doing. 

I find that particularly gross in the case of 24 since it doesn’t just glorify torture - it *valorizes* it."
Beyond,Was it? I never watched it. I should give it a chance?
Beyond,"Torture was hardly the worst thing on that show.  It's just the most political.

Remember when Jack killed Ryan Chappele just because the terrorists demanded it?  Or when Jack killed Curtis to prevent him from killing the reformed terrorist that was helping the investigation?

Jack was a straight Utilitarian.  He did anything to save lives."
Beyond,Of course...
Beyond,"How about you watch it before starting this topic 🤦

But 24 episode series of high quality are rare thing. They even gave up on that concept eventually"
Beyond,"I'm pretty sure they're talking about It's Always Sunny, or the 24 Live Another Day. Idk really."
Beyond,For COVID? So they produce episodes like weekly/monthly? Why didn't they make all the episodes in advance?
Beyond,"People that have been following this project since the beginning said they've been having problems with the production. At first I didn't believe them, but episode 3 was quite clunky so I'm getting worried about the future of this anime (the game was one of my absolute favorites)."
Beyond,"Fantastic so far so it's a shame. 

Very ironic how ep3 was called Break Ti[M]e"
Beyond,This is what killed Uncle From Another World.
Beyond,"Anime in general as an industry has been struggling with brain drain, burnout, terrible pay, employee exploitation and generally just unfathomable amounts of bad management. For every one studio that runs ""well,"" there's five more that are constantly on the brink of disaster."
Beyond,[removed]
Beyond,[removed]
Beyond,"This does not usually happen with Anime productions due to the terrible scheduling that production committees force on the studios. There are times when some episodes are finished hours before the broadcast in Japan. Usually studios hope to be 2-3 episodes ahead.

According to insiders the production for Nier has been a shitshow, Covid is a mild impact and not in Japan for animators, the problem is due to the bad production they have outsourced a lot to china, which has been hit hard by Covid.

Even Mappa with Chainsaw Man were offering double in order to get Chinese animators to work on it to get it across the finish line, which is sad because it was supposed to be Mappa's new studio and new method which ended up not having a great schedule, which is why fight animation continued to struggle.

Very few studios get to usually command enough time to properly make episodes such as KyoAni or Ufotable."
Beyond,Is both. They make 2 or 3 episodes in advance at the same time. They start months ahead. But they end the last one one month / weeks ahead of the end of the series.
Beyond,They were probably busy with other anime.
Beyond,I've heard of rare cases where anime episodes are delivered to networks only hours before airing
Beyond,so they can stay meta and insert pop culture references
Beyond,"Can you explain what was wrong with it without spoiling the game? I wanna finish the game before I watch this, but I'm curious as to what was wrong with Episode 3."
Beyond,It’s all a part of Yoko Taros plan.
Beyond,"Still mad, I was so excited now that they got past the stupid long viewing of his adventure."
Beyond,[removed]
Beyond,I didn't see any struggle in Chainsaw man at all.
Beyond,"I thought it was something related to ongoing long series, I guess they have a really strict schedule. Maybe they should really rethink the whole system and just give more time to the studios.
Anyway, for me Chainsaw Man has one of the best animation of last year, I didn't see any struggle. Some issues in the rhythm maybe, that could have been solved with few more episodes but that's fine."
Beyond,People should watch Animation Runner Kuromi.
Beyond,It should not work that way...
Beyond,"As for me, there is a very major scene in episode 3 (that was also hinted at the end of episode 2) that didn't quite hit like it did in the game. When I played that part I felt somewhat shaken by what was happening, but in the anime it felt too rushed, I didn't feel many emotions in it. 

The whole episode had a weird pacing, as it presents two different locations (the refuge and the desert) of the game without spending enough time with either of them. Especially the part in the desert deserved more weight and a slower pacing to create a stronger sense of immersion imo. And even in terms of animations it felt too much unpolished to me, as if they were doing the bare minimum to release the episode.

Anyway, it's a very difficult game to adapt: it's dense, there is a lot of hidden lore, it's very introspective and has a peculiar narrative structure, so I don't blame them. I'm still hoping that the following episodes will do it justice since the author of the game is part of the team."
Beyond,"You can see from them relying on straight CG more often in later fights in addition to going from 1 ADs to multiple ADs per episode. 

The choreography was much worse compared to shows like Demon Slayer, Bleach or even JJK from Mappa and the fights simply didn't have that level of hype you would expect from such a show. 

Mainly due to Mappa not extending any of the fights and struggling to convey how Fujimoto used manga pages in fights to the anime medium and the simple lack of 2D at times. 

Aki v Katana Man [Link](https://youtu.be/VNsHxCAwUiU?t=51) (watch from here to 1:18)

Honestly, a fan managed to convey the speed and feel of the fight in this cut better (keep in mind, it's 1 fan vs a team of animators + cg + music and voice): [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/kz39aa/aki_vs_katanaman_fan_animation/?sort=new)"
Beyond,"From experience, all anime adaptations have pacing issues because they cover multiple manga chapters in a single episode. I haven't seen any anime adaptation yet that didn't have this problem."
Beyond,What is an AD?
Beyond,"Idk Vinland omitted a little bit, but having read and watched both, as far as season one goes it’s as close to 1:1 as an anime is gonna get."
Beyond,"I don't think adaptions from a manga (especially if compared to video games and novels) are actually that difficult when the animation studio has the time and money to do a good job. Some adaptations are nearly identical to the manga (an example: Monster). But with videogames it's different, since a completely faithful adaptation is almost impossible due to the nature of the media itself. Imagine what a nightmare it would be to adapt Dark Souls and Bloodborne, and Nier Automata isn't much easier."
Beyond,I've found a lot of anime adaptations for games end up feeling more fast-paced and like a promo anime instead of a proper series. Going off The World Ends With You & Scarlet Nexus anime adaptations.
Beyond,Animation Director. They are basically in charge of making corrections and ensuring that the animation is on model and consistent throughout the episode. Typically you would expect 1-2 per episode but when all of a sudden that number jumps up it can be a sign that the production is struggling and they are having to bring in additional people just to keep up with the schedule.
Beyond,"Fair enough if you think that. For me, anime doesn't work so well as the manga mostly because the pacing's off because the animation staff are so slavishly following the panels instead of trying to rework the story into animated form."
Beyond,"I will say it’s episodic and maybe 2% of the manga wasn’t included, but I’d say even more 1:1 was Mushishi and the pacing was hit with perfect stride. Some JoJo stands work better in animation than they do in the manga as well imo, but the opposite exists."
Beyond,"New shows very (very) brief premise: 

Dear Edward: plane crash kills hundreds, sole survivor is a young boy. Based on book.

Masters of the air: WW2 aviators

Wool: dystopian future/sci-fi where humans live underground

Shrinking: A therapist dealing with severe grief begins to breach ethical barriers by telling his patients what he completely thinks, resulting in massive changes to his and their lives. Jason Segel is the therapist

Beyond,We need new season of Severance 🙏🏻.
Beyond,Where's Foundation??
Beyond,"Really excited for Masters of The Air and Wool. And also Hello Tomorrow sounds weird and intriguing, so I’m interested in that one."
Beyond,Finally some official Masters of the Air footage after a year of set pics! Trailer must me imminent.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"This list is embarrassing. It's more like the top 40 science fiction shows I could remember, because too many of these are recent are not really sci-fi. Deep Space 9 doesn't make the cut, while the current Marvel superhero shows do? Only one anime makes the list and it's original Astroboy? "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,Rolling Stone knows Science Fiction almost as well as they know music.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"really, buffy ahead of TNG....wtf?  This list is shit."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Only one anime on the list, and it's *Astro Boy* instead of Cowboy Bebop, or Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, or Space Battleship Yamato (Or Space Battleship Yamato 2199), or Legend of the Galactic Heroes, or Gurren Lagann, or Serial Experiments Lain?

Oh, right, it's Rolling Stone, having no idea what they're talking about is their thing."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"It's not really a ranking so much as it's a collection of things. Also, Twilight Zone should be first. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,They forgot DS9 and Farscape and a few other important ones.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,List doesn't even have *Farscape* on it.  Worthless.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"RS's ""best of"" lists can sometimes list toward critical darlings rather than popular tastes, but I think this one gets it mostly right.  (Though how is Buffy the Vampire Slayer on this list when Supernatural is not?  They're both really horror/supernatural and not sci-fi. Oh well.)"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Let me scroll to the bottom and see if The Twilight Zone is the #1 pick . . . nope, list is worthless. Move along, there's nothing to see here."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"There have been 40 Sci Fi TV shows? You know how people sometime tell you ""You should go out some time""? It's even more embarrassing when you give them reason trash your ""inside"" life as well..."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Interesting point.  Care to take the time to come up with your list and post it here?  I, for one, would love to see it."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"> Only one anime makes the list and it's original Astroboy?

I know, I thought I was crazy when I saw that. Astro Boy(1963) is arguably not even the best Astro Boy series, let alone the best sci-fi anime of all time."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"*Buffy* is one of my favs, but ""Adam"" does not make it sci-fi. 

It also includes *Thunderbirds* which **no critic** has ever called a ""best"" sci-fi show. Worse, it does so at the expense of a show like *Farscape.*

And if you are going to include new shows with just one damn season, then *Dark Matter's* first season was one of the most promising starts to show in quite awhile. The twists at the end of the first and 13th episodes promise one hell of a 2nd season. 

I also can't take seriously any list that has *X-Files*. That show is the epitome of network, episodic TV: a few good episodes sprinkled over a season of mediocrity that in the end added up to a big mess of nothing. Yes, Sully & Mulder were great characters, but that doesn't change the fact the show blew it's entire myth arc in the end. The reveal of what happened to Mulder's sister was the Capone's Vault of sci-fi shows. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,What should be the top 5?

Space Battleship Yamato 2199,I'm trying to fill in my blanks on the AFI 100 and for Best Picture nominated movies. Anything on here other than the obvious stuff (Dr. Strangelove/2001/North By Northwest/Singing in the Rain for example)?
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,Will they ever show Angels with Dirty Faces on TCM again!? 
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"The last real TV show with a spaceship central to the plot was Stargate Universe. MAYBE you could count Ascension, but that was a miniseries that SyFy decided not to pick up to series. Unfortunately, you are right that TV Sci-Fi has largely disappeared, but I think there's good reason to hope for a return with SyFy's new focus on original, scripted programming.

As far as things in the works, SyFy has ""The Expanse"" and ""Dark Matter"" both coming out this year. Dark Matter starts June 12th. I'm hoping they're good!"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,There's a comedy on yahoo screen called other space. I see ads for it watching community. 
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"If you like anime you have to check this show out

[Space Dandy!](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Space_Dandy_promotional_image.jpg)"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"http://www.syfy.com/theexpanse

i want to believe it'll be good"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Not really, it's all about Fantasy these days, and the syfy channel ditched sci-fi with the name change but is slowly turning back.

There is Other Space that came out this year but it's really just a low budget comedy. 
Also the mini series Ascension was kind of about a space ship. 

If you haven't watched the following now is your chance, most are still pretty decent viewing.

Andromeda.  (Kervin Sorbo in Space)  
Battlestar Galactica 2004 (Ronald D. Moore does fantastic Podcasts on the DVD's / Torrent which are very good listen if your interesting in the development of TV shows)  
Babylon 5.  
Defying Gravity. (Greys Anatomy in space)  
Doctor Who 2005.  
Farscape. (Still my favorite)  
Firefly.  
Stargate SG-1.  
Stargate Atlantis.  
Stargate Universe.  
Star Trek Deep Space 9.  
Star Trek Enterprise.  
Star Trek The Next Generation.  
Star Trek Voyager.  

I'm sure there are a few more kicking around also."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I will add **Stargate Universe** is wildly under-appreciated. You don't need to have seen Stargate to watch it. Yes there is a lot of character drama, but the sci-fi backdrop is spectacular. BSG fans will say BSG is better and maybe they're right but isn't their room for both in our lives? "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Rick and Morty is sort of close to that genera. Sort of.  Its more like Sliders I guess. Not really,  but there isn't much scifi on now at all. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,Doctor Who?
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Syfy decided to make cheaper modern day earth shows like Sanctuary, Alphas and Haven and no one else else has really bothered making space shows. 

Syfy has promised us more space shows, I hope they are good, I miss Sci-fi adventure shows too. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Was torn on checking out Other Space, looked it up on IMDB, Trace Beaulieu and Joel Hodgson are in it, both of MST3K fame.  That at least earns it a viewing.
"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Surprised *Defiance* has yet to be mentioned in other comments; it's a solid show, with the third season set to begin in a few weeks, and the first two seasons available on Amazon Prime Video. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,[deleted]
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"The only show since that has grasped ""sci-fi adventure"" for me since Stargate ended was [The Last Ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ship_%28TV_series%29), however it's not the kind of ship you're expecting.

It does however have a very similar feel, which I felt welcoming. I cannot wait until the next seasons starts this summer."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I miss me some Stargate as well!

But if it doesn't involve solving crime, it seems like it's not going to be made. Maybe we could hope for something like CSI:Universe :D (kidding of course!)"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,I need something to fill that Firefly void.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,There have been none since SGU ended in 2011. However there are at least 3 coming out this year (finally).
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,I love that Dark Matter has some of the same producers as SGU did and has kind of a similar plot from where SGU left off.

Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Other Space is great!  Also found it because of Community.

Basically it is Lost in Space as a half-hour comedy.  They are stuck far from home in a spaceship.  Begin jokes. It has Joel and the guy who voices Crow(playing another robot) from MST3K, thought they aren't the main characters.  I feel like the whole cast pulls their weight and has good chemistry."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Yeah if you don't mind anime OP, Knights of Sidonia is what you're looking for. 1 season on netflix, 2nd currently airing in Japan."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"**This!**
The books were/are awesome. :)"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I've actually seen all of those except Defying Gravity, I've never heard of that one.

You should check out Lexx. Fair warning, it's weird as hell. ""Space: Above and Beyond"" get's an honorable mention."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"SG-1 and DS9 are my favorites. They struck the perfect balance of 'baddie of the week' and story arcs.

If you missed an episode you could catch it later there would be a small part of the overall story line but you don't feel like you missed out on something huge.

I used to get really excited for ""Previously On"" because it meant cool shit was going to happen. Now days it seems like every TV show spoon feeds ""previously on""."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,My man! Hell yes another Farscape lover. I feel like so many people missed that show. It was fantastic!

Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"It's basically Battlestar Galactica set in the Stargate Universe, but somehow it really, really works."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"The reason it gets such a bad wrap is that Atlantis was canceled for it, which was just fun Stargate action every week, SGU was so slow and all about characters, they rarely left the ship and when they did it was mostly using magic stones to go back to earth. The main issue however was even after 2 years I still didn't give a shit about any character except Rush and hoped the majority of them died. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"> You don't need to have seen Stargate to watch it



SGU was the worst of the series though,  so it makes no sense to watch it first.  You're just robbing yourself of the much better SG1 and Atlantis. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,Yeah seriously. I think this is the most prominent one. Up there on space adventure shows/movies with Star Wars and Star Trek.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Well, Sanctuary for the record was a web series that was bought by Canadian Broadcast and SciFi just signed on.. so it cost them VERY little to get..  it was also surprisingly fun."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"It hasn't been mentioned because it's not a space adventure show, there have been plenty of earth based sci fi shows since Stargate, but none of them have been amazing.   
Don't get me wrong I still watch them all, the best ones usually come from Canada. But we must want space shoes dammit."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,Are you thinking of Other Space which is out already on Yahoo or is there another space comedy coming up?
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Well, this might be a reason for me to watch"
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"SyFy basically said they have a lot of shows in the works and so Ascension didn't make the cut for a full series order. 

>""We were very happy with Ascension as an event series, but with so much high profile development in the works, we have decided not to pursue a full series.""

Which is disappointing because it was an interesting show. It stumbled a bit, but it was overall fun to watch and the ending of the mini series was a good set up for a full show."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"While we're at it, Space Battleship Yamato 2199 is awesome. It's a really well done remake of the classic '70s space opera that aired over here as Star Blazers, and features a WWII battleship in space with a giant gun."

Lexx and Earth Final Conflict are two shows I've had on my HDD forever and never gotten around to trying."

Space Battleship Yamato 2199,What? You...you mean to tell me there's people out there who haven't watched all of Star Trek: TOS? What a shame. :(
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,There was literally only one good character on that train wreck of a show. Dr Rush.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"She wasn't a bad character, she was just useless, and pointless. SGU was supposed to be one of those ""none of these people are supposed to be here!"" things, but even in that context, she didn't fit."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Except it's nothing like BSG. It is ""gritty"". That's the only similarity. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Also,  they really fucked up by airing SGU in the Winter TV season,   up against all the main TV shows.  


Stargate SG1 and SGA were always *summer shows* which means much less competition for ratings. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I liked sanctuary and watched it all the way through but it was never going to make me not want a show with spaceships and aliens. 

That's still a fun fact to know though, thanks. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"> Space Battleship Yamato 2199

I was wondering if this was any good.  I LOVED Star Blazers, but it doesn't really merit rewatching... then I learned about Space Battleship Yamato 2199... I'll have to take a look."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Space: AAB has some crappy, trite episode plots, and of course was cancelled after one season, but it's also got some gems really worth seeing.  Mixed bag.  Based somewhat on The Forever War by Joe Haldeman."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Earth Final Conflict is pretty solid for the first 2 seasons. Good for the third, eh for the 4th and oh god oh god why does this still exist for the 5th. Lexx makes Farscape seem like an adventure in sanity and conventionality."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,If you watch Lexx you should have a drinking game spotting scenery that's shaped like genitalia.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,The pilot is not indicative of the show. Don't give up after the first episode. 
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,I hadn't watched a single episode of any Star Trek until about a year and a half ago when I was in the same spot as the OP and wanted a space show but had watched everything else on my list. It took some doing but I've now watched them all except TOS.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,I gave up and skipped to TNG after Spock's Brain. Sorry.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,I wouldn't say only good character. I decided I really liked Eli around the finale.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,It was pretty obvious that she was only there to create a love triangle. But I wish they would have given her some sort of skill set that didn't rely on who her dad was.
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I guess it depends on your definition of 'bad.'  Sure, the acting was fine and the character was relatively well-rounded, but I kept hoping she'd be put out an airlock. The episodes that highlighted her were pretty unwatchable."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"A group of misfits flee a massacre to an outdated ship on an outbound course. They spend the majority of early episodes gathering resources and just learning how to survive in their new circumstances. Many of the people who came have no place on a starship and are a liability. Tension rapidly develops between military and civilian leadership. They are hounded by the aliens who caused them to flee in the first place and must keep jumping from system to system.

It's startlingly alike to BSG in premise, clearly the development philosophy was ""Battlestar Galactica is really popular, let's do something like that!""."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Ohhhh man. You're in for some awesome stuff. In my opinion, TOS isn't as good as TNG (I'm in love with the Picard crew), but TOS's movies are much better than TNG. Wrath of Khan is probably the best Star Trek thing ever. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I'm in the opposite camp. Half a year ago I had never really watched any Star Trek at all. My first thought was to watch TNG, but it just so happened that Netflix on my tablet only had TOS. 

So I've watched all of TOS but barely anything of the other shows. I tried after to watch TNG but I now miss Kirk and Spock :("
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"Haha, that's understandable. There's some really lame stuff in TOS."
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,well Rush did use her ability that the blue aliens gave her.  So for a few episodes she was useful.  
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"SGU are lost in space. BSG is about the death of humanity. Wiped out by their old slaves. BSG just has way higher stakes regarding everything. 

Other similaries are just standard tropes. 

BSG has much better storytelling, writing, acting etc. 

It's more like they wanted to cash in on the new style of gritty/dramatic storytelling that wasn't uniquely something BSG did. "
Space Battleship Yamato 2199,"I agree with this completely, except that Undiscovered Country tops even the mighty Khan for me."
Tayo the Little Bus,Would love some bloopers
Tayo the Little Bus,Feels like it just started. I can't believe it's over already.
Tayo the Little Bus,Have Nick Offerman and Bella talk shit to each other since we missed out on Bill fighting with Ellie
Tayo the Little Bus,I don't want to spoil any future stories for myself. Can I play the video game after season 1 ends?
Tayo the Little Bus,You guys would definitely check out Hot Ones most recent episode. Its Pedro Pascal himself!
Tayo the Little Bus,If they don’t reenact the musical alternate ending I’m gonna be very disappointed.
Tayo the Little Bus,"I wish they had more in depth videos about what goes into making each episode. For the final few seasons of Game of Thrones, HBO released like 20 minute long clips about the costumes, the stunt choreography, the special effects and nearly everything else behind the scenes. It have great insight into all the work that goes into each installment."
Tayo the Little Bus,so mixed with the podcast that's \~3h of TLoU content on Sunday. fucking eh.
Tayo the Little Bus,It's been a gift watching these two people star in sci-fi fantasy shows. I can't wait to see what they do next in other movies.
Tayo the Little Bus,Gotta get my fix!
Tayo the Little Bus,Guess I'll be watching it while silently weeping. It's something I guess. 😭
Tayo the Little Bus,"I like the actors, but after watching the first two episodes I had to turn it off. The screenplay and dialog are too formulaic and predictable. In fact, all story lines appear to be lifted from: A Boy and His Dog, Dawn of the Dead, WD, or any other zombie post apocalyptic narrative. I found incredibly tedious to sit through. Again, the acting was fine."
Tayo the Little Bus,Cool advert
Tayo the Little Bus,"I kinda thought they'd expand more on the characters that we love, there's a whole backstory in the days before Joel meets Ellie that I really wanted to see...

9 episodes and 1 was a dlc episode that came after the main game was out for a year. 

Bit of a shame considering Last of Us 2 has even less Joel."
Tayo the Little Bus,"The last of us and the mandalorian are the same show.

Prove me wrong"
Tayo the Little Bus,[removed]
Tayo the Little Bus,[removed]
Tayo the Little Bus,Thats good. I feel like I wanted something akin to the House of the Dragon specials they released each week for these episodes. At least we get this.
Tayo the Little Bus,"People should watch Prospect with Pedro Pascal. 

His dialogue in that movie is great."
Tayo the Little Bus,Or some Joel and Ellie fake deaths like when they die in the game.
Tayo the Little Bus,"apparently pedro pascal did his l.a. accent a lot while on set, as did his other cast members. would like to see that as well"
Tayo the Little Bus,The Laughs Of Us.
Tayo the Little Bus,I feel like 10-12 episodes would have been perfect. 9 is on the short side.
Tayo the Little Bus,1st game shouldve been 2 seasons tbh
Tayo the Little Bus,"For sure can play Part I since it will end where season 1 ends. And who knows maybe you’ll want to play part II afterwards anyway, not a spoiler if it’s ultimately going to be the same story :). I think it’s a story worth experiencing via it’s original medium first."
Tayo the Little Bus,You better end up playing Part II fairly soon because I feel like you’re not gonna be able to avoid spoiler talk after season 1 ends
Tayo the Little Bus,"Yes, season 1 is just the first game including dlc. It's a great game, if you've ps5 or pc you can pick it up cheap enough if you keep an eye on sales. Otherwise you got the ps4 remaster which is still really good"
Tayo the Little Bus,Play Part 1 as it won’t spoil anything and it’s an incredible game. Don’t play part 2 if you don’t want the rest of the show spoiled
Tayo the Little Bus,"""You're smart"" - Pedro to Sean"
Tayo the Little Bus,"I just watched that episode, it was amazing. Pedro Pascal is so damn charming, I just want to hang out with him"
Tayo the Little Bus,"[Listen to the podcast to scratch a bit of that itch](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hbos-the-last-of-us-podcast/id1660320068) \- I believe they are all over 40 mins long and this includes Druckman, Mazin and it is hosted by Troy Baker. Can't get more inside than that!"
Tayo the Little Bus,"Jo and Mal from the Ringer-verse are also doing an interview/recap with Craig Maizin and Neil Druckman, so an extra 2 hours there if you want"
Tayo the Little Bus,"Pedro has to do a project with Nathan Fillion where they can play brothers. Christ, their speaking voices even sound alike."
Tayo the Little Bus,Maybe they’re saving that storyline for later seasons to help even out joel time
Tayo the Little Bus,"They both have different show title names and are also set in a different universe.

Damn, that was easy"
Tayo the Little Bus,Why would anyone care about proving you wrong? Demomstrate that you're correct or your assertion is to be laughed at and dismissed.
Tayo the Little Bus,"I mean they're literally different. 

Dumbass."
Tayo the Little Bus,"This apple and this orange are the same thing.

Prove me wrong."

Tayo the Little Bus,"It would be a little *too* on the meta-nose.

But I would have loved to see Pascal killing Baker while being unable to talk. Voiceless at it were.

For those few not in the know: Joel in the show killing the actor in the show (Buddy Boy) that played Joel in the game (voice + motion caption)."
Tayo the Little Bus,Is this a spoiler? What the fuck bro
Tayo the Little Bus,Oh mah gahhhhhhh!
Tayo the Little Bus,They did make 10 episodes. HBO then combined the first two into a movie length premiere because they thought it worked better dramatically and because otherwise most of the pilot would be the 2003 flashback.
Tayo the Little Bus,It is 10 with the double length of the first episode.
Tayo the Little Bus,Having 9 episodes where two of them are around one hour and 20 minutes is what I’d prefer
Tayo the Little Bus,"How? The game takes about 15 hours to complete, most of which is gameplay. At most this could have 10 episodes instead of 9, but there is not enough story for 2 seasons."
Tayo the Little Bus,Gotta love how a mildly unpopular opinion gets you downvoted to -44.
Tayo the Little Bus,That’s too much. 12 episodes I could get into. 2 seasons is overkill.
Tayo the Little Bus,"Unfortunately it’s not on PC until the end of this month, and it’s $60 so probably won’t be cheap for a while."
Tayo the Little Bus,The stuff that he says isn't even *that* funny but he's so goddamn charming that Sean is losing it and I'm laughing just as much.
Tayo the Little Bus,"Hope so, they nailed the actors and Tommy needs more screen time, I want to know what Joel did to survive, if they can tell a new story about characters like Bill and Frank they can tell something new about the actual focal characters."
Tayo the Little Bus,The easiet gottem of all time
Tayo the Little Bus,"OK, you grumpy folks..The same guy, Joel, take a little child along several seasons. The child has superpowers that nobody has, and Joel has no purpose in life, till he meets the kid. The purpose now is to take him to some enigmatic place with some enigmatic people. Once he delivers, they want to take the kid down.

THE SAME SHOW.

You do not agree?

ok, how about this:

The last of us is the prequel. Ellie develops some symptoms like greeny face and longevity. Also she can be in touch with mother nature. in season 7 Joel get ill and die, and Ellie manage to take an eye of Joel, the last part not contaminated by the fungus, so she can bury him next his brother.

She place the eye ina sferic metallic ball and hit the ground. Finally she cant say goodbye and keep the ball as an amulet.

Years later, season 35, Ellie use the rounded eye of Joel, stored in a sferic ball of steel, to get Joel DNA and to revive him. They need berskar because the weekness of the skeleton, so they go to mandalor, and train as mandalorian.

It turns out Ellie is shrinking, so the ears seem to be huge, and  greening step by step.

As the reconstruction of Joel is a succes, an evil force try to make more clones,  But they need more Joel DNA.

They take Joel, kill him and get all DNA they need. They  turn the startup into a success, and start a special program of mass production on clones!

Once she finds out, she get mad about and convince a new Joel  to destroy the  Clone factory with all the clones but the last one. Ellie get injured and unable to speak again, and almost a fern by now.

The bush with ears and Silver-helmet go for the gallaxy looking for the misterious people and the enigmatic place, while grogu -she doesnt feel like a girl any more and changed her name- plays with the sferic-steel ball, that contains the last piece of his friend. They travel again and forever.

The end"

Tayo the Little Bus,"In case this is serious, no it’s not a spoiler lol. Just happens in video games a lot"
Tayo the Little Bus,"It’s a joke, bro. They both die a lot while playing the game."
Tayo the Little Bus,"Games been out almost 10 years.  If you missed it that long, that's on you."
Tayo the Little Bus,Let's put a pin in that.
Tayo the Little Bus,"Yeah as people have pointed out, when you take out all the slow sneaking, puzzle solving, and random combat out, the actual plot of the final chapter of the game is only like 15 minutes"
Tayo the Little Bus,I would have liked a little more of the connective tissue between sections of the game. I think we probably could have gotten 12 or 13 episodes while giving us little asides during their trip to KC or the three month gap on their way to Colorado.
Tayo the Little Bus,"The show doesn't need to be constrained by the game, as they showed with episode 3 (an example i liked) and introducing the Kathleen character (an example I liked less)."
Tayo the Little Bus,By using the episodes to show more of a relationship between Joel and Ellie. 8 episodes so far and 2 of them were basically standalones.
Tayo the Little Bus,"well they already added stuff into the show that wasn’t in the game, so they could’ve just idk, wrote more into the storyline.

i dont care either way but its not like they couldn’t have done it."
Tayo the Little Bus,They could have easily flexed their writing chops and added more episodes. Develop relationships properly to have better payoffs instead of introducing a character and killing them off the same episode.
Tayo the Little Bus,"Yeah, not two seasons, but I think 10 or 11 episodes would have been better. The quality of TLOU isn't in the Joel and Ellie story alone. It's that they exist in a lived in world. They spent an episode on Bill and Frank. Everyone loved it. It had a very limited connection to the game, outside of them existing in the game. They gave KC residents two halves of two episodes. They gave the DLC an episode. They opened with that couple living in the middle of nowhere. It's the world building naughtydog did that gave TLOU a foundation to tell a great story.

Give me an episode on ish and kyle getting people together, and their downfall... Hell, that's easily two episodes with ish writing on the wall to no go inside, and wandering off closing the episode.

I think they really missed the best part of the game by hiding an Easter egg for ish.


I also dislike how little time we spend with Joel and Ellie just talking, but I don't see how that extends episode count vs making episodes unbearably longer."
Tayo the Little Bus,"Doesnt have to be just the game look at ep3 and the whole bill thing, couldve ran s1 to the end of the city or even joel getting injured if you want to add some story beats to the cannibal arc. Point being it doesnt feel like joel and ellie have the same relationship they had in the game, even abit forced at times, and thats not going to make me care when xyz happens in a s2 based on a game that hit pretty 'meh' to begin with.

And thats a mild take, imagine those that are still seething about xyz happening at all"
Tayo the Little Bus,"The last ep could have been 2-3 eps easy. And with one episode left, it really doesn't feel like there's enough room to finish the story properly. (I hope to be proven wrong, but expect it to be rushed)

And theres a bunch of stiff that could have been in there, that just isn't.

There was easily enough content for 15-18 eps"
Tayo the Little Bus,"Was thinking the same, but they can be angy and enjoy their subpar seasons 2 & 3, god forbid 4

S1EP3 best itll ever be"
Tayo the Little Bus,"Well get ready for that with 2nd game, i could see two 8 ep seasons doing just fine for the first"
Tayo the Little Bus,No one's reading all that. Don't watch if you don't like it🤷‍♂️
Tayo the Little Bus,[removed]
Tayo the Little Bus,"I played the game...and the fakeouts are very obviously fake outs, otherwise the story ends"
Tayo the Little Bus,"That’s why I was having a hard time seeing people say ep 8 & 9 needed to be longer when they saw their run times 

Like, take out all the gameplay and combat and plot wise I can see how the creators said we don’t need a full hour"
Tayo the Little Bus,Yeah. They did that entirely anyways. Imagine being ok with them not spending at least 1 episode on it. Or injected as 5 minute set pieces each episode.
Tayo the Little Bus,"Kathleen was fine, I guess. I just find it weird that they spent two episodes with her, Henry, and Sam. Henry and Sam have an effect on Joel and Ellie, sure, but a lot of Ellie’s development comes from her time with David. We saw a lot of it, but something was missing. I don’t know what, but if KC can have two episodes, there’s no reason they couldn’t flesh out David & James more, or alternatively expand on what the ending is. 43 minutes is short to wrap it up, regardless of if there’s so much gameplay."
Tayo the Little Bus,"It's both really, episode 3 was great but looking at the season as a whole it feels like each episode is an ""arc"" and it's missing some connective tissue. There's a lot of talk about how the game is about 14 hours anyway and they can use all that gameplay time to flesh out other characters, which is great, but it's during the gameplay that Joel and Ellie's relationship builds. The show is still really good but I think they could've struck a better balance with another episode or two."
Tayo the Little Bus,"The rest of the game from this point is under 30 minutes even including all the gameplay, stopping to listen to the recorders, reading the notes, etc. So they could cut to an actual play through of all the remaining content and it would only fill half the time slot, being rushed isn’t a concern. (I checked a play through on YouTube for the actual runtime. 28 minutes from David’s death to the end credits.)"
Tayo the Little Bus,"who says i dont like both of them? 

i just say that are the same story, with the same principal character."
Tayo the Little Bus,That's why they're saying they would be funny post show behind the scenes bloopers. Not something seriously used in the show.
Tayo the Little Bus,"8 could have been longer. We definitely missed out on David and Ellie having to fight off infected , that would have been a great 10 minute segment in the show as it was important in the game"
Tayo the Little Bus,"Episode 3: universally lauded for all the extra material added by the show runners.

Episode 9: let's just rush through it as fast as possible because it was all gameplay."
Tayo the Little Bus,"The show has fallen into the trap if ""its a zombie apocalypse with no zombies"" 

A brief aside where they encounter infected, like the tunnel section of the game, is kinda needed for world building.

That and a few more moments of actually showing us the relationship they've forged. (Including the DLC, instead of showing us in the present, was absolutely a mistep).

And a little more space to let the ending breath, and possibly even a moment to set up the next beat, wouldn't go astray.

But there's not the runtime for that now.

I dunno. I guess we all find our tomorrow night how they go with the finale."
Tayo the Little Bus,"You say this as if this isn't an entire subgenre of content - a kid and a father / parental figure. You'll find a lot of other shows and movies like this, I think you're basing most of your opinion on the fact that Pedro acts in both and both are airing simultaneously."
Tayo the Little Bus,"Craig Mazin has a podcast with Neil Druckmann where they explain that things like that are combat for the game. They work for the game. It would not necessarily translate for a show. Repeated infected would get old, fast. See: TWD. 

I also would watch the show for what it is, and not always compare it to the game. It keeps the core story but does its own thing

I’m grateful for Craig and Neil’s adaptation/translation"
Tayo the Little Bus,Both episodes were very highly reviewed. Episode 8 has the second highest user score of the series and received largely positive critic reviews. It’s not like it got trashed
Tayo the Little Bus,"I never said that at all.

And the scene I mentioned isn’t repeated infected and a slog of a scene. 5-10 minute scene of them fighting off a hoard would have absolutely worked on the show."
Tayo the Little Bus,"The combat section with David was what causes him to eye her. How the fuck David saying Ellie has a ""violent heart"" even makes sense when he and the audience didn't see her engaging in violence in the show?"
Tayo the Little Bus,The title of my sex tape!
Tayo the Little Bus,"I enjoyed it.

Waltz is playing the kind of person that got him Oscars. That he outshines the rest of the cast is the biggest problem.

There’s a lot of loose strings too.

Still kept me guessing while binging."
Tayo the Little Bus,"I enjoyed the show, it was fun and had me guessing on all the weird stuff...but LITERALLY NOTHING IS EVER EXPLAINED.  The ending to the show SUCKED ASS."
Tayo the Little Bus,The “prime video” curse
Tayo the Little Bus,It was so weird I kept watching it but I agree ultimately it was just meh.
Tayo the Little Bus,Kinda weird review to lead with not having watched past episode 3.
Tayo the Little Bus,Could've *Consulted* someone on how to make a good show that's for sure 🥁💥
Tayo the Little Bus,"Did anyone read the book?  I really don't want a season 2, but is there more to the story?  I feel like they got everything wrong that Severance got right."
Tayo the Little Bus,"Binged it. It's not bad, just expect a weird dark comedy. The worst thing about it is that it doesnt explain everything at the end, and there's way too many loose threads. They didn't own up to the mystery that was set up at the beginning, and that brings it down a major amount for me to the point that I wouldn't recommend it."
Tayo the Little Bus,"Watched it all this afternoon. It was ok.
But so many holes..inconsistency in the character development. The main 3 all changed so much without much reason.

Plus there was next to no resolution in the end other than the ""what he's made of"" bit. Also seemed like the consultant had done much worse stuff previously.. and towards the end outside of the what the show presented in general.

I mean its entertaining but some really poor execution in character building and the story itself overall"
When They Cry,"They wanted to convince us the character would throw away a sweetheart deal, and thus his entire life, to win back the admiration of Kim.  I don't think they made a persuasive case for that at all.  And with the prisoners chanting ""Better Call Saul"" in unison, they gave us the single cringiest scene of the entire series."
When They Cry,"dude Ozark had one of the most disappointing finales in recent memory. you're nuts for thinking that was in line with the show but BCS's finale wasn't. 

But it seems you're funneling the ending of jimmy, saul, and gene into one ending as if a single moment was supposed to end all of those story lines -- which is not possible. The cartels etc wasn't ""written into a corner"" for a finale, you must remember that Saul's story ends like 3 episodes before the finale. Everything after is solely Gene's story, which ends in its own manner, with the remembrance of Jimmy, and a near courtroom eulogy for Saul. They are different stages of the same person, yes, but you are still only considering Saul as if he's the ""true"" Jimmy McGill. Likewise I saw no ""fairy tale redemption"" for him, his redemption if ever comes after the last scene."
When They Cry,I can't recall a better series finale.
When They Cry,"I also have this unpopular opinion. The last episode felt rushed, it should have been split into two so all the scenes could develop further, but the actual story points I have no problem with, it's just the pacing and directing that felt off.

I also didn't like the ending to Breaking Bad.

But I also have the unpopular opinion where endings don't ruin a show for me, so even through I didn't like the ending of BCS it's still one of my favorite shows I've seen."
When They Cry,I liked it
When They Cry,I thought it was a satisfying ending. My only gripe is the 86 year sentence. It seems a bit excessive. I think Saul will eventually find a way to get out. He'll start a new life in Hollywood. He'll produce the story of Walter White on the big screen.
When They Cry,"I loved the ending of Ozark. I love that they could not get away clean. Masterfully done.

Better Call Saul’s ending HIGHLY disappointed me. The last minute courtroom switch made no sense with his character. I cannot believe any reasonable person would trade a 7 year sentence in a nice jail for 86 (EIGHTY-SIX) years in a terrible prison.

Especially not Jimmy McGill. The crisis of conscience felt a little too Hollywood. (Also I don’t see how they were laying all those charges on him.)"
When They Cry,"Not just the finale but the entire final season was bad. Everything hinged around how they treated Howard and that felt incredibly out of character for the both of them. Howard didn’t deserve any of that, he wasn’t Chuck."
When They Cry,"I agree with many of your points. While not all bad, it felt rushed and I expected better and it was a letdown, based on the quality of the show up to that point. The noble prison thing was lame, and out of character for Saul or Jimmy."
When They Cry,"I enjoyed reading this, I found myself let down that in the space of the last so many episodes, we don’t get even one ‘last’ scene of Jimmy and Kim and the final straw for their breakup. I guess I was thinking they would show something more dramatic and his transition to the full-on Saul persona once and for all. A little disappointed we didn’t get a final scene with Fring / Mike either but I suppose we did, in reality, with the Lalo finale ep.  This probably represents a lame take but I was expecting more dialogue, more depth, more scenes with interactions in the present to wrap it up instead of a long running commentary on Jimmy continuing scam-life, as entertaining as a few of those were."
When They Cry,"I hated the Gene storyline, all the way to it's culmination and yes, the finale. In my eyes, he'll always be slipping Jimmy"
When They Cry,"It was a completely disingenuous ending to a great character. In a world where there really is no justice, what a cop-out, cheap ending. For shame Gilligan and Gould"
When They Cry,"Yeah I found it to be a pretty weak ending. Just felt forced and cheesy. Not only that, but the climax of the main timeline a few episodes earlier was quite disappointing as well. The character of Lalo deserved a lot better."
When They Cry,"I found S6 to be a major disappointment but found the finale satisfactory but forgettable. The more I think about the ending it seems to get worse. Originally I thought it was a masterpiece then it slowly began to age worse in my mind.

I still think it is a great ending when compared to other shows. Like a 8-8.5/10. But the final season as a whole disappointed me."
When They Cry,I licked it.
When They Cry,"The counter-circle-jerk has begun. As things were, so they are, and ever shall be."
When They Cry,No.
When They Cry,Yes.
When They Cry,"Yes I'm disappointed at the ending too.
He basically volunteered to not live his life. Wich really doesn't fit I think. Even a remorseful saul Goodman/jimmy mcgill wouldn't loose the wish to live life to it's fullest. All the time he did what he did because he could. Because he wanted to live life with everything it could offer him. This spirit wouldn't vanish, just because he decides to be a honest man from now on.
Yes, he did tell people what he did and why. But what for? He could have been remorseful 7 years in prison. There is no sense in having to be in there for 86 years except that kim now thinks better of him. But he can't even see her (regularly)."
When They Cry,"It was clear Vince Gillian was not as present for the last few episodes.   Although he was entirely on board for the crap ending.  Their reasoning was Jesse went free, Walter died, so in this series, someone had to go to jail.  Okay, but for 86 years?  I liked the extreme pushing Saul to prove he could get less time. And get Ice-cream) In reality, no person would be on board for a literal life (death sentence imprisoned).  If you actually love someone, you are not pleased with this sentence.  It was disgusting to see Kim's disapproval continue on until Saul/Jimmy life was Sunk.  And then to end on them sharing a moment, a smoke and joke about "" You had 7.5 years, you got 86 but with good behavior, who knows!"".  What were they thinking?  Clearly, they were not.
A redemptive arc for Jimmy/Saul would have been he does some time in prison. 10-15  years.  He redeems himself by devoting his time to volunteer educating inmates. There were a dozen of alternatives. 
Kim has less accountability and was entirely responsible for going after Howard.
Kim's reasoning was, together her and Jimmy were not good together.  Because they enabled each other.  People got hurt, Howard got killed.   So they were no longer together.  
Kim Wexler character has zero character. I am sure Saul, Jimmy, Gene was content and happy being left to rot in a super maximum, but he ""won"" ""Kim's "" approval.  Meanwhile, Kim returns to Florida."
When They Cry,"It felt lazy and too storybook for the rest of the series. You spend the first few seasons hoping something good will happen to Jimmy because he seems to be on an endless losing streak, honestly he should have got away with it in the end, I think it would have been better. 

Gets the girl, gets away with the crime, somehow ruins Skyler Whites life a little bit more because fuck her….."
When They Cry,The Gene episodes were so incredibly drawn out and boring to me. There was a lot of unnecessary storytelling that made me totally antsy and uncomfortable.  They should have separated it like they did with El Camino. It was like a completely different show. To go from the edge of my seat cartel drama to boring b&w storytelling. I still loved the series and am considering watching again.
When They Cry,"No I loved it. The point was that Jimmy wanted to redeem himself in his and Kim’s eyes. Everyone else didn’t matter. Kim know Jimmy would be inclined to bs his way out of everything. So offering up his soul in the court room meant something to her. 

They both had to take accountability to put the past behind them and be at peace. It wasn’t terribly rushed or anything."
When They Cry,"Yeah, I agree with you. Was surprised by how easy the ending went on Jimmy. It was a swerve at the very last moment. Couldn't believe they showed him in prison with not a care in the world, and in fact getting constant props from other inmates.

I know a lot of people loved it, but I was just surprised that was the way the showrunners decided to depict prison and Jimmy within it.

I honestly think the camaraderie and good vibes between the cast and crew bled over into the writing so that the characters were handled with kid gloves at the end. Possibly to keep various options open for further spin offs."
When They Cry,Nope
When They Cry,I liked it
When They Cry,I liked it
When They Cry,you wrote all that for your opinion. It was one of the best in modern history
When They Cry,I liked it
When They Cry,No
When They Cry,"I heavily disagree, I can agree that the finale felt rushed and ended somewhat abruptly but the finale was perfect in my eyes, the Time Machine scenes with Mike. Walt and Chuck were the perfect send off scenes for those characters. It depicted them so well while showing us in the last one with Chuck that Jimmy's regret is not having that heart to heart with Chuck that night hence Chucks book ""The Time Machine"".  The episode did an awesome job of making us believe Saul was going to become pure evil by lieing and dragging Kim down with him to get an absurd 7 year sentence, everything about the court scene was absolutely perfect, the suit, the music, having that douchbag Bill as his advisory council, the way Saul just cleansed his soul of all his sins and became Jimmy again was beautiful, he showed that his love for Kim and the guilt of breaking the Law outweighed having a 7 year sentence and living with himself for the rest of his life as a lie and a cheat. Kim and Jimmy having one last smoke with the same cinematography and music as the first time they met was the icing on the cake, people need to get over the ""Better Call Saul"" scene on the bus, I didn't really find it cringy It just showed us that Jimmy is going to be fine in prison, hell might even run it because of everyone remembering what he did for them over the years.  The end ended somewhat abruptly but looking at it now I'm OK with Kim's last glimpse of him being the last scene of the show.

This is my opinion and how I precieved it, everyone has a different way of how they pictured the finale to go down but I believe the majority of true Breaking Bad/BCS fans found this finale to be near perfect, the only things I would have wished for was Skyler and maybe Huell and Kuby to be there at court but that's more fan service than being a necessity, I was glad to see Marie and Agent Gomez's wife"
When They Cry,"Hi.
I have not talked about it with anyone.

I ""wanted"" Kim to either be killed or be in jail.    

I don't understand why Kim was not working as a lawyer?    I don't understand why she was namby pamby or whatever you want to call her ""personality"" eating lunch with those coworkers.

Had she been disappeared by the vaccum store guy?    Was that implied?   Or maybe I missed it?   If so, why?   

I also thought it was kinda dumb that Saul basically volunteered to go to jail for a long time."
When They Cry,"Well you basically just defined moral ambiguity in TV. Is it more interesting to study the morally conflicted than it is to study the morally decided. Duh. That's why the show follows ""evil"" people. Also, you're pretty quick to condemn people as evil. Maybe adopting a less simple, less dichotomous definition would be good. Then you'd believe that the show follows the razor's edge of good and evil and that that's what makes it great. Is it ok to do bad things for decent reasons? I guess that question and its like are looked at in the show. 

More importantly, after talking about how sociopaths are oh-so incorrigible, you talk about how McGill's final decision is meaningless, making him no better a person. Well the whole point of his last decision is to show that McGill, an evil guy in your own words (as far as I could tell), could change. Maybe it doesn't heal any damage (plus I'm not convinced that anyone thinks that sentences heal damage), but it does show that he can change if he wants. He's not seeking the sentence because he wants to deflect blame (or whatever); he's seeking the sentence because he doesn't want to be slippin' Jimmy anymore and this is his last shot at being someone else."
When They Cry,Kim just wouldn't be practising law anymore.
When They Cry,"Bit late to the party but couldn't agree more. The guy who could lie in his sleep decides to become Mahatma Gandhi & speak the truth at the most critical time of his life!? Cmon!

A clear conscience could have been achieved even with spending 7 years in jail. He could have opened a pro bono practice or something after those 7 years to get the ""approval"" of the person he hadn't seen for 6 or so years.

Not just the finale, but the last two seasons seemed inconsistent. Kim & Saul's reasons for going after Howard also seemed rushed. Like Kim had one not-so-great encounter with Howard at the court (season 5) and then decides to ruin his life!? Umm okay..

Lastly, this black & white thing seemed fine when it was just a few scenes, but having whole episodes with it..Na, definitely not a fan.

&#x200B;

PS: Does anyone know if Peaky Blinders had a decent/consistent ending or not? I'm thinking of watching that next."
When They Cry,"I know ppl liked this ending but for me also this was prolly the worst ending writers could come up with. The last season went against everything I liked about this show from humorous witty moments as opposed to more serious narration of breaking bad, to forcing a demise for characters viewers cared about, like how Kim Wexler, pullin off a sudden break up or rushed ending of Lalo and whatever they wanted to do with Nacho. From my perspectiv the previous seasons showed the good nature of Jimmy despite being hated by almost everyone not a vile criminal who MUST face his inevitable punishment. Another point of attraction of those seasons were Mike being an interesting character who we cared about but now in the final season he became trivial and almost forgotten in the final ride. They also did dirty to Kim. Especially this character was interesting because unlike Skyler, she actually supported and helped the protagonist/anithero, but I guess the writers at some point decided to punish her for that and for me that build up didn't make any sense whatsoever. The awkward sex scene of Kim with that random dude felt like so forced and out of place I think writers wanted to defile her one way or another. Either way it was obvious the writers had some urge to force their moral compass (again). All in all I find it weird how the light hearted spin off of Breaking Bad had more of a tragic ending than it's more serious predecessor."
When They Cry,"I was really interested in seeing what happened to Kim in season 6. Their relationship and mainly Kim’s loyalty to Jimmy was what really made the show great along with all their shananagans. I was disappointed that how the show ended simply because I was hoping they had a happy ending. Sort of rooting for the bad guys. 

But Jimmy getting 87 years instead of 7 was real because of how many times Kim bailed him out. And how many times Jimmy pulled off a scheme for Kim’s benefit. They loved each other and even though she couldn’t live with what they did and left for Florida, she was in love with him and wanted him to be ok. When Jimmy found out she confessed about Howard, his only choice was to sacrifice himself to save her and by doing so, prevent her from being sued or charged. He did it for her like he did so many times during the show. 

It may seem corny, but one of the shows main themes was their love story and that is what they ended it on. Her being his lawyer and seeing him on prison. Great acting and they really connected well. I think this show was better than breaking bad"
When They Cry,"> They wanted to convince us the character would throw away a sweetheart deal, and thus his entire life, to win back the admiration of Kim.

No, it was about redemption period, not just Kim. That's why he also mentioned what he did to his brother in court, despite it not even being a crime.

>And with the prisoners chanting ""Better Call Saul"" in unison, they gave us the single cringiest scene of the entire series.

The writers just needed a quick way to show Jimmy would be okay in prison, and wasn't going to suffer daily in a high security penitentiary. It also calls back to when Saul was suggesting Walter White turn himself in and face the music:

>Saul to Walter White: ""You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that?"""
When They Cry,"Yes! This was my issue with it. He would do all that for  woman he had not seen in years? Willing take on 79 more years just so she would admire him again?

It really is not reality."
When They Cry,"I agree about Ozark.  It didn't feel like an ""ending"" at all, more like they just arbitrarily decided to stop making more episodes.

People argue that the end fits because the Byrds will just fuck over everyone and anyone to get what they want, which I guess is in line with the whole rest of the show, but that is exactly my problem with it.  They could have made that ending at literally any other point in the show."
When They Cry,"> dude Ozark had one of the most disappointing finales in recent memory

Dexter: New Blood has entered the chat."
When They Cry,Breaking Bad!
When They Cry,"I know this is an old thread, but finally watched it last night. I enjoyed the ending a lot"
When They Cry,I was good at it.
When They Cry,Probably he'll try to short his sentence or getting transferred to a better jail instead of remaining into an (unrealistic) ADX.
When They Cry,"Agreed. Jimmy was way beyond the point of caring. He was hardened. His character change was out of nowhere and there was no reason for him to give up his scheming to suddenly come to terms with all the biggest moments in the whole series that he could never accept

A much more fitting ending would be for him to get away with a 7 year sentence and pull off one last scheme to save Kim by weaseling past the system, and then going to jail with a smile on his face knowing he got away with it. Because that's who he became after chuck died.  Or, to fail in his scheme and go away kicking and screaming. 

Instead the writers redeemed him in a very unauthentic, cornball way that left me knowing without a doubt breaking bad is a superior TV show"
When They Cry,I loved the gene mall montages with the Cinnabon but gene was overall depressing
When They Cry,"Agreed! As wicked, evil, and as smart as Lalo was, he went out way too easy. The show was a bit anticlimactic after that…"
When They Cry,WHAT!? Season 6 was amazing what did you not like about it? May have went in a different direction than I thought it would but the way it all went made perfect sense to me
When They Cry,How'd it taste?
When They Cry,">The point was that Jimmy wanted to redeem himself in his and Kim’s eyes.

Sometimes you can understand the point and still dislike how it was executed.

Kim didn't really take accountability, all of the problems that occurred for her were because she chose that for herself. There was no real judgement. She had the freedom still to choose what life she wanted. Just because the story depicts her current life as a bleak one doesn't change that. In contrast Saul's freedom to choose is now completely gone and he was judged by an authority figure."
When They Cry,"> Yeah, I agree with you. Was surprised by how easy the ending went on Jimmy. 

He's going to die in prison. How is that going easy?"
When They Cry,"Jimmy was broken up with Kim for years why would anyone throw there life away for a ex girlfriend. 
You obviously never seen a prison documentary lol
Prison is tough especially doing life with psychos
You're probably a kid that has never really seen jail"
When They Cry,"Basically all of this is answered in the show:

She did not use the vacuum guy to disappear. She clearly has a nameplate on her desk in Florida with the name Kim Wexler, her coworkers call her Kim. Remember, Walt, Saul and Jesse all got new names and identities when they disappeared. She goes back to ABQ to meet with Howard's widow and submit her affidavit to the court, etc. She is plainly not hiding.

It's super clear Kim feels very guilty about how her scheming with Jimmy leads to Howard's death. She doesn't trust herself to not do anyone harm, so she cuts ties with Jimmy and the law. Her life in Florida is so opposite from her life in ABQ on purpose. She's put herself in a place where she can't harm anyone. 

That extends to her new personality. Florida Kim doesn't trust herself to make basic decisions (the ice cream flavor at the office party, the mayo substitute, etc)."
When They Cry,"> I don't understand why Kim was not working as a lawyer?

She resigned.

> I don't understand why she was namby pamby or whatever you want to call her ""personality"" eating lunch with those coworkers.

Uhhh, she gave up her life's passion and left the man she had passion and love for? Now she's living a dull life that doesn't excite her.

>
Had she been disappeared by the vaccum store guy? Was that implied? Or maybe I missed it? If so, why?

Uh, no.

>
I also thought it was kinda dumb that Saul basically volunteered to go to jail for a long time.

He wanted redemption."
When They Cry,"I kind of agree. Her name pamby character was too abrupt. It didn't feel very genuine. 

I imagined Kim and Jimmy being Bonnie and Clyde and going down together. That would have been more suitable for how the show set itself up for the first 5 seasons"
When They Cry,"He didn't give a shit about redemption until the prospect of Kim being in trouble arose.  And I understand the purpose of the bus scene, that doesn't make it work any better though.  They could easily have found a non cringeworthy way."
When They Cry,"How does dying in jail redeem anyone? Redemption is about the truth setting you free, dying in prison aint that. I'm not getting the whole ""I loved it"" crew. The ending made the the series pointless."
When They Cry,Agreed
When They Cry,"This is a good point. Maybe the show should have ended with Lalo's death.

Jimmy deciding he needs more prison time still seems like a nonsense illogical ending for an otherwise cunning and shrewd character."
When They Cry,It made perfect sense for a person who is able to talk their way out of anything to talk themselves into dying in prison? That an old woman who could barely turn on a computer could suddenly plug it in and use Google? That she would find Saul as a conman when he was actually a lawyer with a good track record? That he'd confess to impress a woman who left him years ago and how he'll never be with? Literally nothing about any of it made sense. Nothing.
When They Cry,Tastes like a bunch of convicts chanting my name on a prison bus.
When They Cry,She literally confesses and leaves it up to everyone else to punish her as they see fit.
When They Cry,"Right, I didn't memorize every detail, but I do remember now that her coworkers knew her as Kim wexler.

I didn't feel like the show explained why she wasn't working as a lawyer in her new location.    She didn't go tell Howard's widow until later, but, OK, I can see the explanation that she didn't trust herself anymore."
When They Cry,"Not Kim being in trouble, she's still in trouble. His actions did not protect her from civil litigiation. He lied to the prosecutors (off camera) and claimed he had information to incriminate her criminally, but he only said that to make sure she appeared in the courtroom so he could give his true confession, on record (just as Kim confessed on record to Howard's widow).

Plus from a writer's perspective, Jimmy either had to die or get locked up for the rest of his days. Otherwise there'd be more story to tell where he's free and willing to continue doing crime. If Saul won, it'd basically be a repeat of the Breaking Bad ending, bad to the very end. Instead he chose redemption, inspired by Kim, his brother, and just a slow culmination of events in his life."
When They Cry,"I think he clearly still cared about redemption throughout his whole time as Gene. The man was just a hollow shell, only by admitting his actions and facing justice can he move on mentally. 

That's the first time in the whole show where he admits to anyone that he was the one who got Chuck killed. The guilt over that is so clear throughout s4-6"
When They Cry,"> The ending made the the series pointless.

He stopped repeating the same mistakes he kept making his whole life. He could have conned his way out of a long prison sentence. Instead he came clean, he was just honest for once, completely open and honest, regardless of the consequences. He chose another path. That path has serious consequences, but it redeemed him.

If he had gotten out of prison after 7 years or less, he would have just gone back to fraud and crime. The show couldn't end unless Saul's gone. So, Saul ""died"", and Jimmy McGill was born again. It was about Jimmy's redemption, not Saul's. If he got away with it, it'd be the same Breaking Bad ending, bad to the end, embracing the criminal alter ego completely (Heisenberg). Jimmy broke bad for a long time, but chose another path, and became Jimmy again, not Saul."
When They Cry,110% on Jimmy take
When They Cry,"Agreed, thank you."
When They Cry,Yeah you’re dead right.
When They Cry,"He knew he could get away with it, but he chose not to. He'd rather live his life in prison as Jimmy McGill and be able to look Kim in the eye, than live free as Saul Goodman, alone. Saul Goodman was the last thing he wanted to be. I'm surprised this went over your head, they alluded to it from season 1. His divorce scene with Kim (""have a nice life Kim"", obvious denial), the ending to S6E9 where he has no one but a hooker in his house (loneliness), heck his entire relationship with Chuck (""he'll never change"", discouragement). He WANTED to be the honest guy people loved, except the people he sought that love from didn't precipitate, EXCEPT for KIM. She was the only one. So once she left, he did what he did best, at the cost of his morals, honesty, and true love.

In other words, he never wanted to be ""the person guilty people hire"". So yeah, he did it for Kim, but he mostly did it for himself.

Also, I hope you realize Saul Goodman was one of the most wanted men in America at that point who was known for illegal activities and scam cover-ups. I wouldn't say an old lady typing in google, ""conman from Albuquerque"" is far-fetched."
When They Cry,I'd rather have a Cinnabon tbh
When They Cry,"Yes but she doesn't really face any consequences for her actions. If she really wanted right now she has the freedom to go back to the type of life she wants. However, Saul does not. He actually faces real punishment"
When They Cry,"That is the equivalent of being grounded. Kim, a former attorney knows that involves zero jail time.  A civil suit ""could"" ruin her financial.   Kim deserves more than that."
When They Cry,There was the whole scene in the breakup episode where Kim tells the judge that as of that morning she wasn't a lawyer. And then later Jimmy is desperately trying to get her to reverse her decision to give up the law .You can't practice law if you're not a lawyer.
When They Cry,"Actually I respect that take. I think they could have made a better redeeming arc though. Okay he came clean but nothing good came out of it. I see nothing redemptive about dying in prison.
As a lawyer he should have asked to see the evidence against him (it was probably scant anyway) and let justice take its course. He'd have probably got off and then he could have seen that as being given a second chance and then being shown determined to make the most of it. This really did nothing for anyone. Him getting justice by being let off due to a lack of evidence would have actually spoken more about the American legal system and the fact that its existence is a lot of the reason Jimmy was able to become Saul in the first place."
When They Cry,"I don't think he redeemed him, he just finally accepted his decisions have consequences.

My interpretation is this:

Saul Goodman won. He had a 7y sentence.

Jimmy McGill finally made a good decision.

And he chose to be McGill to himself and Kim. Even though the world will always see him as Saul Goodman."
When They Cry,"An old lady who could only load up cat videos suddenly being able to use ask Jeeves is a stretch. There were better ways for that to work.

It's not that things went over my head (albeit thanks for believing I'm intelligent enough that it would surprise you) and it's not that he chose to spend his life in prison, it's that there was a better way to come to that conclusion. He confessed. Big whoop. Why didn't he just do that in ep 1 season 1 and we could have just bypassed about 10 episodes and a truck load of unnecessary black and white? Just made the whole thing a massive waste of time. Look Kim in the face? A face he'll hardly see in the coming years, hardly a motive. Also he was already going to prison so it's not like he was getting away with anything. Definitely a disappointing end in that regard."
When They Cry,They literally say she’s at risk of losing everything she has in a civil suit
When They Cry,Lol after that affidavit no state bar will allow Kim to get her legal license back
When They Cry,"This old lady could only watch cat videos when she first got the laptop. I don't think it's a stretch to say she's learned what ""ask Jeeves"" is over a month of time. 

You don't have to like the way the show went, but to say it doesn't make sense is wrong, which is what you said in the first comment. But now, in this comment, you are saying you don't have a problem with the fact he chose to spend his life in prison. But later on, you then say Jimmy choosing to go to prison because he wants to make things right with Kim isn't a motive?

If I'm honest, it's hard to know what you're saying. I'll assume the last thing you said is what you mean. In that case, I've explained these motives in the last comment. If you don't buy it and still think it doesn't make sense, fair enough, but the entire show from 'episode 1' has been alluding to it. If you don't buy that Kim is a part of a reason, that leaves everything else I wrote about morals and consciousness, basically the essence of Jimmy's character (aside from Kim). And if you don't buy that, then there's not much point in discussing this anymore. 

My thoughts are that I thought the ending was perfect, to every minor detail and flashback (except for the ""better call saul"" chant on the bus). Same as the parallels in the episode before. As much as I wanted him to get away with it, it made the most sense to his character that he didn't, given the context of the ENTIRE show."
When They Cry,But she chose not to be a lawyer anymore anyway.
When They Cry,"No it's not wrong, just because you've made sense of it and it makes sense to you doesn't mean it has to for everyone else and just because I said it didn't make sense that doesn't mean I disagreed with the ending. What didn't make sense to me was that after everything he just confessed. The allusions aren't really anything they're just plot armour, conveniently placed for us to feel there's context to the ending. Just like the cringey bus chanting. What I'm saying here is that if this was about Jimmy righting wrongs that's fine but the avenue they chose to bring it about was lazy and hasty. I'm also not convinced the state had that great a case against him or they wouldn't have offered him only 7 years and the way this show has dragged I can barely remember what he did to be wanted in the first place. It's not that BCS wasn't a good show, it was especially the back story, it's that it has been plagued with scheduling issues and AMC's stupid mid season breaks meaning it's been hard to piece together the story for those of us who have watched since the beginning because the story is rich and complex and considering the back story is rich and complex, it's a shame that ending want given that same build up and attention. Three tacked on episodes. We deserved better. We were meant to get 13 EPs a season,  think had we had that there have been more time to build up to the ending the way it needed to. I envy the people who are watching now, I think they'll have a better experience as they won't have to wait two years between certain seasons and months halfway between others."
When They Cry,"You said ""if she really wanted right now she has the freedom to go back to the type of life she wants"". The life she had before was that of a high power lawyer which she cannot attain. No company car, no fancy apartment, etc. She can't go back to the life she had, even if she wanted to"
When They Cry,"This is the most braindead game I’ve seen about the show. Why would he confess in s1 ep 1? That episode was him being a lawyer and the black and white scenes had to do with gene trying to hide from “Saul” while still keeping that attitude. Walter had a drastic impact on almost everyone he met. The black and white scenes were to show how gene got affected and him getting back to his roots. The ending is a masterclass in storytelling and the perfect end to the show. I’m not even sure how you got through 60+ episodes of this show and completely misunderstanding a character this bad. The 6 seasons were to show how jimmy got up to this point. The flashforward/flashback scenes represented jimmy and sauls morals conflicting with each other. Everything, from chucks betrayal, chucks death, Kim dragging jimmy (and joining) into becoming a scammer, was never his fault. He was the product of what happened around him. This is show in season 1, when he genuinely listens to chuck about waiting and trying to become a good lawyer. He then gets backstabbed by chuck and hears the line “I’ve never really cared much about you” from his own brother. This single handedly kills most of the “jimmy” morals left. Most but not all. We see this within the Saul flashbacks in season 6, where he hesitates and never looks into the eye, while talking to kim. She takes notice of this and leaves without saying anything. He also hesitated before talking to walt in the school, and hearing that he has cancer. His character arc is about learning to accept who he truly is, and how changing names or running away from that, won’t change anything. He’s lost everything and everyone from trying to continue as “Saul”. He made the choice to give up everything in the end because he found no  reason to continue as a conman. Lalo is the perfect antagonist for jimmy. Both Saul and lalo are sociopaths, with one being far more violent than the other. Those seasons 5/6 were to show how both these characters are similair, and how lalo was one of the characters and reasons as to why jimmy ended up to where he is at the end of the season. Those 3 characters, chuck, Kim, and lalo were all part of jimmy, and ones who caused him to go from “jimmy McGill” to Saul goodman. Chuck forced a wrong view of himself on his brother, Kim forced jimmy into scams towards the end, and thus led to lalo becoming involved and the eventual demise of Kim and sauls relationship. The ending of the show was to represent how all these 3 characters affected him, and caused him to make the decision to give into prison. Also you saying how jimmy not ever being able to see kim again contradicts your point about how he did it just because kim was there, but jimmy won’t ever be able to see her again so that point is worthless. Kim was PART of the reason as to why jimmy gave in, but not the entirety. Seasons 1-3 was to show sauls moral and external demise as jimmy, while 4-6 was to show his internal collapse. In the end, there’s still a flicker of jimmy left in his soul, and he felt guilty of everything he had done, which was shown by hints within the Saul flashbacks and Walter and the person he drugged, both having cancer, representing how he’s not entirely sociopathic. His arc was t a redemption arc, but rather a twisted one. In the end, he truly understood that no matter what he did, or how much he ran, jimmy McGill was still him, and yet he deserved his punishment in prison for all his crimes. A poetic and perfect ending to the story, which you clearly misunderstand, along with the whole point in the show."
When They Cry,"Yes Kim has her black and white life in Florida,  potatoes salad and the yup man.  She was relentlessly, ridiculously after Howard.   Jimmy was accountable but not as much."
When They Cry,">No company car, no fancy apartment,

Does she even care about this? I mean she came to the realisation in previous seasons a high paying job wasn't enough for her and she would rather defend people in the cases she actually cared about rather than selling out.

But yes okay fair she can't be a lawyer anymore. But she had already chosen that to be the case years ago."
When They Cry,"Having a different perspective is allowed. It's not that I didn't get it, it's that I didn't enjoy it. I didn't think the end was very good. It was rushed and we deserved better. Brain-dead? Meh takes over to know one buddy."
When They Cry,I enjoyed reading this and fully agree
When They Cry,"So what exactly do you mean by ""the life she wants""? 

I'm guessing you mean a lawyer taking care of the little guy, right? Well first off, she can't do that as we've discussed. Also, her plan to fund that venture was the Sandpiper money, which she gave entirely to Jimmy as she didn't want blood money.

So either I don't understand what you think Kim wants right now, or what you think Kim wants is not attainable."
When They Cry,"Saying you think the ending was bad is one thing. But saying “WE deserved better” is objectively incorrect. The show ending within one episode with no prior build up makes sense, because all that build up was the 6 seasons before it. This is proven by the black and white scenes appearing at the start of every season. Having a dramatic finale with many episodes of buildup to the finale isn’t true to what the show is about. This is essentially asking for plan and execution 2.0 which had a lot of buildup. The end was gene realizing that he’s still jimmy deep inside, and there’s no reason to continue, which doesn’t need any dramatic buildup since all it takes for everything to end was one sentence admitting to all his crimes. The episode gave glimpses of chuck, his past, etc. and it was the perfect episode to end the series off.

Breaking bad did the same and everything practically ended within one episode with no buildup. The reason why that was also perfect was due to the ending tying up all the loose ends and feeling like seasons 1-2. The ending stayed true to what the show is actually about, and walters character finale, without dragging it on for no reason."
When They Cry,">So what exactly do you mean by ""the life she wants

What I mean is she is still out in the real world and has freedom to choose whereas Saul is in prison and has no freedom."
When They Cry,"In your opinion. Nothing I've said is objectively anything, it's my opinion as is what you've written yours. 

Better call Saul did drag, we had a two year gap in between seasons at one point plus originally each season was meant to be 13 episodes long. I feel there was a lot that we missed out on by losing essentially a whole entire season. The pace of the show lent itself to a more masterful and calculated build up, it was in the same vein as ""and they woke up and it was all a dream"" yawn. I found it meh my sister loved it but gets why I found it meh."
When They Cry,"just finished the series. sorry but this ending is bullshit and don't come at me with that time machine BS. BCS Ending should be an open end, not like BB, end was clear from the begining. sorry this is ass."
When They Cry,"Do you know the definition of a prequel? Better question, did you ever watch breaking bad?"
When They Cry,"Yes to both.

BCS was both a prequel and a sequel though."
When They Cry,"It was not a sequel. Sequels and spin offs are two entirely different things. Better call Saul was a prequel and spin-off. This is sauls story, not walters. Every antagonist you’ve seen before is gone, including all the salamancas. The only thing left is for Saul to die, which he did."
When They Cry,"Also your whole argument is untrue. Your claim states that Saul confessed everything in court because Kim was there. He actually made up his mind on the plane, and was the one that actually brought Kim over for her to witness this. He had no reason to bring up chuck, but he did, so that the world knows how bad of a person he was. This made him happy. He didn’t change plans mid court, and it’s brilliant writing."
When They Cry,"Not sure why you felt the need to write that, just unnecessary. Yes the show is a spin off in the generic sense but seeing as it told Saul's back story it's a prequel and it also told us Saul's fate after Breaking Bad thus making it a sequel just like El Camino was. I don't what point you're trying to make with your semantics other than a need to be argumentative for the heck of it.

I believe I said that Saul confessed because of Kim not because she was there but either way meh! I didn't think it was great writing I found it easy and lazy. 

Nothing I wrote is untrue but rather my perspective as is everything you have written yours. In life you'll meet lots of people with different opinions and perspectives. It's allowed. I know it's hard for many Redditors to communicate with those who don't comply with their group think but it's part of growing and learning. Nothing you've said has made me even want to think about anything in that show differently, why? Because from the off it's been insulting and combative. I would have been more welcoming to your opinion had you spent more time simply talking about what you enjoyed and why you enjoyed it rather than constantly trying to tell me ""you're wrong."" I'm not. Neither are you. It's just perspectives, opposing ones are allowed and there's room for both here."
When They Cry,"The move into Times Square ruined what MTV was at that point.  Before that, they always did location shoots for their genre video shows either in a random diner in Manhatten or down in Point Pleasant during the summer.  Once everything got shoved into the TRL package, focused hard on boy band or other bubble gum pop acts and it really sucked."
We Bare Bears,"> We Baby Bears features the Baby Bears on their search for a place they can settle down and fit into. Each episode transports them into vibrant and colorful worlds, where they befriend legions of familiar fairytale faces. During their nonstop crusade, they are faced with the decision to stay or to continue on their journey for a permanent abode they can call home.

Seems like an odd direction to go after concluding the original series if you ask me, especially since we already know where they end up calling home."
We Bare Bears,But the whole fun of the show was how aggressively normal it was a la King of the Hill
We Bare Bears,"I just hope they feature the same voices or at least the same style of voices. 

I've gotten used to Baby Grizz sounding like he sounds."
We Bare Bears,This show has such a sweet feeling to it. The episode about Big Foot was beautiful.
We Bare Bears,It's a shame this show isn't more talked about. It was amazing.
We Bare Bears,"I actually think it looks quite interesting. They are going for a more anime style adventure series.

This looks like it could just be for kids but I hope it has an older appeal."
We Bare Bears,This is pure speculation but it feels like something funky happened behind the scenes. The cancellation was abrupt and they left some loose ends out there.
We Bare Bears,So basically 'Sliders'?
We Bare Bears,"Yeah, bears walking around talking to humans is completely realistic..."
We Bare Bears,idk howd they be able to. haven't heard baby grizzs voice in a few years but the kids 14 now. I remember him as catbug in Bravest Warriors when he was 7. Idk how much longer he can keep the baby voice up.
We Bare Bears,"Got overshadowed by gumball, adventure time, regular show, Steven universe, and for younger kids... Teen Titans Go. All those shows ran for years like we bare bears. Deserves way more recognition."
We Bare Bears,"It will age *extremely* poorly though. And I don't mean that as a slight against the show itself, but it really gets into culture circa 2016. Like the smart phones, internet memes, tote bags, give it 5 years and it's going to be like Yo Yogi for the 90's. I'm not saying it's a bad show"
We Bare Bears,"Not really. The movie was planned for ages and they announced they were pivoting to the baby bears like two years before the end.

We Bare Bears is a merchandising powerhouse but there's only so many stories you can do about gentrification or wanderlust. They ended it before it got stale."
We Bare Bears,Or Quantum Leap.
We Bare Bears,"I don't know, I heard they make Zachary Callison huff helium before recording as Steven Universe so they could keep Steven looking 10, or 12, or 13, or 6 depending on the storyboarder for that episode"
We Bare Bears,"Don't those young kids in showbiz just get pumped full of drugs to keep them small and young-sounding? I always assumed that was what happened to Elijah Wood, Frankie Munoz, Haley Joel Osmont, Jake Lloyd, etc."
We Bare Bears,"Yeah all those shows definitely innovated more than We Bare Bears, but WBB was just a solid, cozy, well written show.

WBB is definitely a beloved show among my friends, but I can understand why other CN with heavier themes would be discussed more on Reddit."
We Bare Bears,[deleted]
We Bare Bears,Teen Titans Go gets all the hate because it's DNA is all Warner Brothers. The DC aspect of it is a veneer. It's really just the latest in the line of Warner Brothers Looney Tunes style cartoons. It's the closest thing on air to the likes of Animaniacs. Looney Tunes is great whatever your age.
We Bare Bears,"Now before they prepare it, they need to give it an actual good time slot"
We Bare Bears,"Sigh. Missing the important bit: [it drops for sale digitally June 8](http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2020/05/21/cartoon-networks-beloved-bears-stack-up-for-their-greatest-adventure-with-first-ever-movie-we-bare-bears-the-movie-drops-digitally-june-8-190503/20200521cartoon01/).

Given the theatrical release was supposed to be March 20th..."
We Bare Bears,Wait was this actually getting a cinema release? This really bums me out
We Bare Bears,"A lot of the press I'm seeing says it's a TV Movie, but I got the theatrical release info here: [https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/We\_Bare\_Bears:\_The\_Movie](https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/We_Bare_Bears:_The_Movie)

It looked like theatrical release first, then eventual TV broadcast."
We Bare Bears,I love them...I started watching with my daughter...now I watch them alone and laugh my ass off
We Bare Bears,">Cartoon Network greenlit a new animated series, “We Baby Bears,” that will feature characters from “We Bare Bears.” Each episode of the upcoming show will place the bear siblings, Grizz, Panda and Ice Bear, in different locations around the world, on their journey to find a perfect permanent home. The series comes from “We Bare Bears” creators Manny Hernandez and Daniel Chong.

Always loved the baby bear segments. Only problem will be the absence of Charlie."
We Bare Bears,Ice bear approves
We Bare Bears,Better than uncle grandpa. 
We Bare Bears,"So happy! Deserves more attention - such a sweet, funny show. "
We Bare Bears,Good news! This one and 'Clarence' are my favorite shows to watch with my kid (except when Mom's not home and we can watch the Simpsons)
We Bare Bears,"I love this show sooo much. I liked the show from the beginning, though I got worried that it would get old eventually. But after watching some of the newer episodes it seems like there's a lot more to it than I thought :)"
We Bare Bears,Ice bear needs more episodes
We Bare Bears,"Love this show, it's so upbeat. "
We Bare Bears,"with all the news about most of the bigger shows getting canned, this is some of the better news thus far"
We Bare Bears,I'm only in this for Ice Bear
We Bare Bears,"I love the episodes that show them as cubs, so freakin cute."
We Bare Bears,"It is alright I guess, but it just seems too forced, like purposefully trying to make fun of trends that kids would like nothing about."
We Bare Bears,"The show is ok, but rewatching the episodes can be dull. There is no real humor, just a series of plot points that you already know are coming."
We Bare Bears,Seriously? I thought it was agreed upon that this show was over-hyped by it's few moments of internet popularity and was actually pretty sub-par. Is this show seriously still going?
We Bare Bears,"huh, well compared to their other recent shows like Clarence, teen titans, and steven I didn't consider it that great.. but what do I know I'm 26"
We Bare Bears,Amen to that. That fucking show is banned in our house.
We Bare Bears,"At least that is getting the SpongeBob treatment,  for the better or worse. "
We Bare Bears,I had Cartoon Network playing as background noise while I was cooking the other day and this show started and it was the most confusing thing I've ever seen.
We Bare Bears,"I'm sorry you don't like that show, it's one of my faves."
We Bare Bears,Clarence is amazing. I discovered it while babysitting my nieces last summer. They didn't watch it but the constant commercials made me check it out myself and loved it. 
We Bare Bears,"The Yuri episode messed me up man! So good
!!"
We Bare Bears,"Yeah it's weird, it's almost like shows aimed at kids, on a kids network, don't ring true with an ""adult"", weird. "
We Bare Bears,"i hear steven universe is for man child pussies. this show seems cool, about some bears who don't take shit too serious."
We Bare Bears,I was watching Steven Universe and he made a guest appearance.  I skipped it so fast my mouse wheel flew off.
We Bare Bears,"Never seen it, what's wrong with it? Or better yet, what's it about, cause I have no clue."
We Bare Bears,Gumball has some adult/life jokes
We Bare Bears,">i hear steven universe is for man child pussies.

The downvotes prove this statement true."
We Bare Bears,[deleted]
We Bare Bears,">Steven Universe
     
Love that show but I really wish CN would stop spamming hour long blocks of it.."
We Bare Bears,Basically it is as idiotic as you can get for a tv show. Its a show about basically a god that lives in an RV with his friends and they go on adventures. 
We Bare Bears,"Same with Sesame Street, your point? Just because a kids show deals with real life issues, it doesn't mean it's for adults. "
We Bare Bears,April fools joke mandated by the network for cross-promotion. 
We Bare Bears,"They are pretty much making up for lost time now that they realize how big of an audience it actually has. Back during season 2 and 3 when we were plagued with frequent months long hiatuses reruns were barely on at all, maybe 2 hours total a week. It was pretty dark times for a SU fan. It is being a bit over-saturated now but honestly it's better than never being on at all."
We Bare Bears,Spamming? They only air at 6 AM. That's it.
We Bare Bears,Too bad it's the networks first crossover since...well 2013 sadly. 
We Bare Bears,I adore this show a lot.
We Bare Bears,Is this show watchable for adults? Because I want to watch it now but I don't want to sit through the teletubbies or something.
We Bare Bears,"This explains why their backstory is them being homeless orphans. Even when adopted, they couldn't abandon their family."
We Bare Bears,Saw most of an episode in passing. It was Ice Bear's backstory with the Russian hermit guy. Surprisingly sweet story with a fair amount of depth for what looks like a pretty kiddy' show.
We Bare Bears,"I think the metaphor kind of breaks down when you consider that if I see an Asian American walking down the street, no part of me is like ""Uh oh, that person might suddenly decide to tear me into bloody strips and then eat my entrails.""  Not exactly true with bears."
We Bare Bears,"Concept is promising, but like too many cartoons today those visuals are just dreadfully boring and lifeless

"
We Bare Bears,[Youll enjoy this](http://i.imgur.com/QxKYW3O.gif)
We Bare Bears,I'd say so. It's very charming and intelligent. 
We Bare Bears,"It's a very interesting show. It manages to be silly and intelligent at the same time and the recurring cast is amazing (Jason Lee, Patton Oswalt, Charlyne Yi)."
We Bare Bears,It's about bears using technology and Internet memes.
We Bare Bears,"Yeah, I found it strangely intriguing, as an adult. They have started doing several shows like that in the past 4 or 5 years. I don't seek it out but I will not turn the channel if it is on when I turn the TV on."
We Bare Bears,"I'm an adult with no kids, and I watch this show. It's light, and 15 min long, but I find the comedy hits the mark better than most."
We Bare Bears,"Hyperbole is often used to deliver social messages in art. Of course that's not how'd you'd really respond to a bear, otherwise it wouldn't be a metaphor."
We Bare Bears,I think they've moved towards subtle tones. Over the Garden wall shared the minimalist art style and clean lines but had a more distinct tone than most animation. 
We Bare Bears,"They can't all be Ren & Stimpy. Or i guess a modern day cartoon that looks crazy, Adventure Time?"
We Bare Bears,Do you have to watch in order?
We Bare Bears,The regular cast is great too - Bobby Moynihan and Demitri Martin (and Eric Edelstein isn't as well known but fantastic in the show too) 
We Bare Bears,So like teletubbies for millennial adults? I'm in. 
We Bare Bears,"I'm definitely gonna check this show out on a night I've got nothing else going. Not tonight, though. Unless WBB and Westworld go really well together. :)"
We Bare Bears,Over the Garden Wall was exceptional in it's visual execution and a prime example of this style being done right. 
We Bare Bears,"I get they can't all be R&S, but you'd hope at least a small handful would be taking notes (and not to be that guy but even Adventure Time can lay it on pretty thick with rigid shapes and perfectly parallel-line noodle limbs)"
We Bare Bears,"I haven't. It's loose, like Regular Show. "
We Bare Bears,"Eh, more like teenagers if they were bears."
We Bare Bears,Oooh. Thank you.
We Bare Bears,"Cartoon Network is getting as bad as Nickelodeon with their advertising. I hadn't heard of the show until this thread, and I am going to watch it right now and then edit my post.

EDIT: After the first episode, I think I'm hooked if the rest is anything like the first. Witty, some subtle humor, and I love Ice Bear. "
We Bare Bears,"Dan Mintz is the voice actor for Tina, not Demetri Martin."
We Bare Bears,"I saw some commercials for it awhile back but didn't know that it was out already.  From what I saw the animation looked good, it's great to see that there's so many high quality animations recently."
We Bare Bears,"Yeah I've been watching it and enjoyed it so far. I'm a big AT fan and while this feels simpler than the huge world and complex themes AT has been exploring, I've found the show to be very charming. One of the selling points for me was the voice cast and they definitely make it work, and there's some great physical humor in the show, which sometimes goes under-used in animation (I still chuckle when I think of Ice Bear's pick & roll in the first episode). Prior to watching I was a bit worried the ""modern"" aspect of it (viral videos, smartphones, food carts, etc.) might feel a bit forced (in trying to appeal to modern kids) but it has been handled well thus far and doesn't feel out of place. Really hope CN gives this show a shot to get the attention it deserves (although AV Club is already covering it weekly which is always a good sign) and a season renewal (although they seem to have invested quite a bit in it and got a talented voice cast so hopefully they're wanting it to stick around). It's quite charming and I'm looking forward to seeing how the show evolves as it goes on.  "
We Bare Bears,I love it so far! There's a subreddit for it btw: /r/webarebears
We Bare Bears,"Thanks for bringing it to my attention, i'll check out the first ep!"
We Bare Bears,"Yeah, I have been watching it since it premiered.  I really like it so far.  I love a funny cartoon."
We Bare Bears,"I never understood why Reddit loves Cartoon Network so much outside of Adenture Time. 

I've given all of the other shows a shot but they were just insufferable to me. SU, Clarence, Uncle Grandpa all felt exclusively like terribly animated shows for kids with ADHD with not a whole lot to offer adults rather than a bone ever half hour to keep them from killing themselves. 

Regular Show, while I'm not a huge fan, at least catered a lot more to adults directly in a similar fashion to Adventure Time, but still lacks some of the nuance that makes Adventure Time go beyond ""oh we had that in the 80s, cool"" into real world connection and often very dark themes. 

Is this just another kids show or actually worth watching with humor that goes beyond absurdism?"
We Bare Bears,"You really should, it's a great piece of animation and I hope more people find it as enjoyable as I do. "
We Bare Bears,"Thank you for the correction, fixing it right now."
We Bare Bears,"Awesome! Thanks for the link, subbing right now."
We Bare Bears,"A little late to comment, but I can't possibly see how you think Steven Universe is catered to ADHD kids. If you just saw the first 10 episodes, I could maybe get it since those were about Steven being childish and dealing with magic, but past that he matures after going through some real interesting and plot heavy stuff. Compared to Adventure Time, I'd say Steven Universe is the much more mature show, considering the characters feel so much more believable and genuine."
We Bare Bears,"I wonder what the title of the show implies? Does it mean to be read, ""We, Bare Bears"" as in they are ""exposed""? "
We Bare Bears,"I find that incredibly hard to believe as far as adventure time by season 4 begins to really show the inner workings of its characters without being surface level about it, but I'll give it a try.

And yea, the first few episodes were just unbearable for me to watch of SU. "
We Bare Bears,"Well once you get into the show the bears live a very simple life (a very bare life) so We Bare Bears. It's sort of funny once you get it, another reason why I love this show."
We Bare Bears,"I can't speak for your tastes, but when SU first came out and I saw the first episodes, I hated it and didn't watch it for 2 years. I just decided to watch it through recently, and boy does it really pick up. Second half of season 1 is where it really starts to shine. I wouldn't recommend this, but if you really just wanted to go straight to the heavy stuff right away, start with the two part episode ""Mirror Gem/ Ocean Gem"" then watch past there chronologically. There's important things introduced before that, but the real meat of the show starts there."
We Bare Bears,"Does the boy grow up at all?

One of the things that makes AT so unique is that Finn grows up from a child to a young adult throughout the series and his evolution into manhood and sexuality as well as deeper schools of thinking is only one of the many amazing aspects of the show aside from an entire fleshed out world and mythology, surreal humor that doesn't stoop to the level of immature in the postmodern sense, characters that regularly subvert archetypes presented in the genre, and music that is hauntingly fitting and full of feeling.

Is the Order a Rabbit?,I love Tony Shalhoub so much. I wonder if Monk will be as OCD as before because at the end of the series he wasn’t. I hope they don’t kill off the step daughter that would crush him.
Is the Order a Rabbit?,I love the idea of seeing Adrian and the gang again but that title has me concerned.
Is the Order a Rabbit?,"Damn I thought I had all the time in the world to rewatch the series and then finish the last season which I missed at the time. I'd start now but Im already rewatching Futurama to prepere for that revival. I guess this is an odd modern dilema to be in. Finishing shows before their inevitable revival comes out.

The Magicians,"It's got a pretty wide range in tone. Sometimes, yeah, it's like the CW made a Harry Potter knockoff. But then it's got some dark swings. I mean really dark. 

I don't know much about the source material, nor did I make it into the third season. It's pretty good, though. The first season is really well done."
The Magicians,"I love that show. 

It’s not going to be for everyone. It’s campy and silly but also tackles really dark material. 

I would say it’s like a love-child of CW and HBO"
The Magicians,"It gets better as it goes on (and somehow Quentin is way worse in the first book compared to the show).

The character development is top notch. Plot is pretty good but gets convoluted sometimes."
The Magicians,[deleted]
The Magicians,The first season is the weakest -most network shows have bad first seasons - and it has weird pacing issues but it gets better with every episode and every season.
The Magicians,"The magical school always gets Harry Potter nods, but it felt more like Narnia by way of Buffy to me."
The Magicians,"Holy shit yes. I absolutely love it. It's fantastic and only gets better over time. 

Couldn't recommend it more."
The Magicians,"I've heard people use ""melancholy"" to refer to this show, and that's a good place to set your expectations. It's got some really mid mids, but that doesn't define the show. The highs are really fuckin' great. Best of all, it goes out on a high note, without dragging the show to death, with a full and resolved character arc to the main character.

It really does great work on depression. The main character really struggles with it from the very first episode, and it never truly ""goes away"". It's more about how you can still live with that condition and what kind of choices and decisions you can make to find meaning in your life.

Happy endings can feel good, but they often feel phony to me when a character just fixes all their problems and gets a happily ever after, since mental health doesn't really work like that in real life. At least, it hasn't for me. I find this show's approach much more relatable, and thus, more inspiring.

Some people dislike the last season, but after watching the show a few times, I think it all builds together into something worthwhile."
The Magicians,"I love it. It's got real Buffy energy. A bit campy and melodramatic, sometimes silly (Buffy-style musical ep?) but super entertaining. I love the pacing - they really fly through plotlines, and it keeps things feeling fun and exciting. It does get better after the first season, when they give up even trying to stick to the books."
The Magicians,Seasons 2 and 3 are extremely good
The Magicians,"Honestly yeah but as others have said, the first season is kinda weak. From there it's one of the best fantasy shows I've ever seen, and honestly I sing their version of a lot of songs cuz they're straight bops."
The Magicians,I loved the books and I adored the show.  I feel it can come of as CW'ish but shows that are truly CW'ish take themselves seriously. As where the magicians as a show embraces that its fucking weird and quirky. Some of the best most wtf moments happen in this show. It extremely quotable and pretty much you will either love it or hate it. The central protagonist starting out is a mentally ill angsty nerd. If you can get over some of the cringe I feel it is really worth it.
The Magicians,"I'll say this. Whatever tone they're trying to go for in a given episode, they go HARD. Sometimes it's a goofy fantasy romp with jokes and silliness, and other times it's the among the most harrowing human tragedies ever put to film. Binge watching the way I did will lead to tonal whiplash for sure."
The Magicians,"I LOVED this show. I think it’s good. Are there issues? Yes, but I had a fun time throughout and I had to binge all of the way through"
The Magicians,"The first and last seasons are by far the weakest, but i love the characters and world"
The Magicians,It’s a guilty pleasure for sure but I found it mostly entertaining. And 100% agree on OTD.
The Magicians,Having watched the whole thing i would say I don’t regret it.
The Magicians,If by CW you mean it mainly appeals to teen/young adults then I'd say that's incorrect. Plenty of my 30-40 something friends love it.
The Magicians,Don’t watch the last season. That’s about all that needs to be said.
The Magicians,"It’s so good!! In fact, I think it’s time for a rewatch. I went into it knowing nothing about it and I’m so glad I gave it a shot."
The Magicians,its amazing
The Magicians,"The first season is absolutely the weakest, and almost made me give up. Glad I didn't, though; it gets so much better in the subsequent seasons and is now a show I've really come to love! The characters start finding their footing and become way more interesting and developed. It also has some truly hilarious moments. Eliot and Margo are now two of my most favorite TV characters ever. I def wouldn't have seen that coming based on Season 1 alone."
The Magicians,MY FAVORITE SHOW! WATCH IT!
The Magicians,"I think it’s a wonderful show but yeah Quentin is the absolute fucking worst. They’re all pretty terrible in season 1. I think the female characters are way more compelling and the magic system is cool as fuck. Seasons 2-4 are definitely the highlights but 3 is hands down the best written and executed season. What gets me about that show is that it’s basically a campy soap opera with magic about growing up, specifically into late adulthood. I fell into watching it when I was graduating college and the whole “wow the world is so much more fucked up and harder than I thought/who am I anymore after the shit I’ve seen and done/reckoning with your own traumas” part of the story relatable. It’s definitely not everyone’s cup of tea though. The characters can be obnoxious, make horrible decision and be downright mean but as the show progresses they all develop into complex nuanced people, especially Margo and Alice. I think the downfall of the show really was that they focused way too much on Quentin who is the blandest and most boring of the bunch. He’s just a depressed fuck boy with a perpetual victim complex."
The Magicians,Heyyyy! If anyone ever wants to talk The Magicians it's one of my favorite shows and I am ALWAYS down! Love it!
The Magicians,Not after it becomes about magic politics
The Magicians,"The books are EXCELLENT and the series is very good although it has hit a miss moments across the seasons. 

I highly recommend the books and think the show is quite good and worth watchibg"
The Magicians,The books are better
The Magicians,"Well, the books sure are."
The Magicians,"It started off kinda weak cause they couldn’t decide what the tone was, so it was both jokey and also very serious, it got really good from S2 when they fully leaned into the kooky weirdness, and then got bad again towards the end. I never finished it but the middle was genuinely very fun."
The Magicians,"I'm very biased bc it's def one of my favorite shows. The first season is a little slow, mostly bc it's building up to stuff but about halfway through it picks up. 

Seasons 2 & 3 are great. The pacing finds it's footing, everything starts to come together and they're genuinely good TV. The rest of the seasons kinda lose the plot a bit. Most fans didn't like the direction writers took romantic storylines and imo they did kinda kill a lot of character development and BBEG build up in sacrifice of rushing the plot. They're still fun and enjoyable, it just felt rushed.

The show differs a lot from the source material. I've read the series and imo the female characters are much much better and well written in the show. And the male characters are better fleshed out with motivations that make sense in the show."
The Magicians,"I thought it was good if not great. I disagree with other comments that say it gets worse, if anything after they run away from the book plots I think it gets better, though I didn’t like the last season as much. There’s also an excellent episode in the 3rd season that is the best in the series and one of my favorite episodes of any show (“A Life in the Day”). Overall it’s better writing and better acting than anything people call “CW” shows."
The Magicians,"Try the books first, they are a bit better."
The Magicians,"It was a good show up until the final season, after they killed off a certain character i lost interest."
The Magicians,I loved it. I’ve watched it several times.
The Magicians,"Short answer: Yes

Long Answer: Hell Yes"
The Magicians,"Having read all the books, I couldn't make it past the 3rd episode. To me it felt like a totally different vibe. And yea, very CW-ish"
The Magicians,I WANT to watch it. I love the books but i get a few min in and my “THATS DIFFERENT“ reflex kicks in.
The Magicians,"I liked it a lot.. hale applebaum is fantastic. The plot gets really convoluted towards the end and I would get confused if I was trying to watch it while doing something else. But I’ve always like the uniqueness of SyFy shows… it’s got comedy, fantasy, drama, sex… I think the actors are good and elevate it beyond the script."
The Magicians,"One of my all time favorite shows. It’s dark, witty, magical with solid world-building and a bit of high fantasy. Really good characters and season three is one of my favorite tv seasons of all time. I highly recommend !"
The Magicians,"I loved it. I thought it was funny and snarky but also really emotional and smart. The actors are massively better than CW actors. Margo morphs into one of the best characters on TV. Alice is kind of annoying (and her wardrobe is stupid) but she gets better. I’ve watched a ridiculous amount of CW shows and I was never reminded of them. It has a very different tone, is grittier, and the humor is more mature and just much more clever. Adult focused CW shows still feel
like teen dramas and The Magicians doesn’t have that vibe at all. The group of friends are supposed to be college aged or a little older and they act that way. They feel like real people. It’s refreshing really."
The Magicians,"Parts of it are phenomenal. Parts suck. 

There are some episodes and arcs that are annoying. Some characters that make you eye roll. BUT there are amazing and poignant and beautiful storylines and relationships too. If you can put up with the drivel the payoff in the last season(s) is worth it.  

Eliot and Margot are the absolute best!"
The Magicians,"The Magicians is legit one of the only shows I’ve ever scene that got better with every single season and ended well.

The first season is actually not that good, I just watched it because I read the books. It deviates pretty aggressively from the books in a good way. It is one of the few shows I watched fully through multiple times and my wife actually enjoyed."
The Magicians,Love that show. It only falls off in the last season when the show runner leaves.
The Magicians,"I think it struggled to begin with coming from the source material which is skewed a bit younger, but I loved it and would love more seasons of it"
The Magicians,"This is the first time I’ve heard it viewed like a CW show, but I respect your opinion. It’s one of the best fantasy shows I’ve ever seen. I think it does get progressively better as it goes on."
The Magicians,"It really is better than harry potter by a long shot, the series is much darker, and really overall it is pretty good."
The Magicians,Bro the show started sooo good. It turned into something else towards the end though
The Magicians,"Funny, we're watching that right now and it's pretty good if you like the sci-fi type of show it is.

Imagine a more adult Alice in Wonderland almost.  


Edit: Only complaint would be that the it completely deviates from the books after season 2."
The Magicians,isn't that the show with the woman from 5 Second Films
The Magicians,I loved the show. So much humor!
The Magicians,"I think the Magicians hits different for people in different points in their life. Growing up is a major theme of the show. I personally love it. One of my favorite things ever made. There’s definitely some worse episodes and some very good episodes. 

If you like things about fantasy and adult themes I would try to at least watch the first whole season. Season one has many tone shifts as well as very fast story progression."
The Magicians,"I enjoyed it. It can get super dark and pretty graphic...there is a rape scene that is very graphic. It can also get supper silly with things like trees with bacon growing on them. lots of in between. 

It's like Harry Potter without wants for adults"
The Magicians,"If it helps your decision at all, there is sex magic"
The Magicians,Definitely not for everybody but it was absolutely for me.
The Magicians,"The Magicians showed me magic is real, individual, and belief based."
The Magicians,"Seasons 1-4 are good, with season 3 being the best. Season 5 was meh. 

It’s very much edgy Harry Potter for adults, but if you like that kind of stuff definitely watch it."
The Magicians,CW with a big budget is a good description of a lot of Netflix.
The Magicians,The Magicians is excellent. Easily top 10 all time type show. Just watch it and enjoy.
The Magicians,The show was a lot of fun.  It will get a lot better for sure.
The Magicians,I really like the writing -/And I’m a 52 year old man! Margot is hot. Seriously the writing is super interesting!
The Magicians,It was a good bit of fun! Gets better after each episode.
The Magicians,"Its solid. Not CW in the least.  It does go really dark sometimes, but I liked that."
The Magicians,Not even half as good as the books.
The Magicians,"I'm a huge fan of the book series but I thought the show was a mixed bag. They literally burned through all of the main plot and compelling setting (Hogwarts, but University) from the books before the first season was even done, which was a huge, huge mistake.

However, they really nailed the casting and managed to drag a reasonably interesting show for a season or two out of the excellent source material and some fun setups. However, the latter seasons, having sped through the plot from the book, were left to tell painfully bad allegories about climate change and white privilege in a quasi-fantasy setting which killed any interest in the show, not to mention it was pretty expensive to film in an era of declining budgets for linear tv networks.

I would love to see someone take another stab at an adaptation, as it's a great literary meta-commentary on fantasy fandom while being an excellent fantasy itself as well as a grown up take on a school for magicians. I think it could be a huge hit, although it might be problematic to film some of the major plot points in 2023."
The Magicians,"Listen. I loved it. But if we're being honest.... It's pretty bad overall with a lot of fantastic sprinkled throughout. The main characters are often incredibly, frustratingly stupid or self destructive but that really just plays into the teen angsty drama of it all so it is what it is.

&#x200B;

It's worth a watch IMO but dont expect it to blow you away. It's pretty typical Sci-Fi Channel quality stuff. lol"
The Magicians,"It definitely gets worse as it goes. I stayed for Olivia Taylor Dudley, if I’m being honest."
The Magicians,It’s odd how similar it is to The Order on Netflix and they both share one of the same actors.
The Magicians,Ok I’ll be that person - the books were better.
The Magicians,It started out promising and then got far too teenage soap opera sexy times for my taste and I tuned out.
The Magicians,This is my ultimate guilty pleasure show. My wife can’t stand when I periodically get sucked back in for another rewatch.
The Magicians, It’s very good and does very interesting things. It’s not CW at all- the characters were specifically aged up from the books to avoid that. Watch through at least the first season
The Magicians,"We always have room in our TV schedule for something with characters that we like going on random adventures, and this show delivered in spades.

The plot was all over the place, but this show was having fun without being insulting to either the audience or itself, and that's a tricky balance. The characters were *great* \- more fully realized than the books, really, with a lot of really good performances."
The Magicians,"I can totally appreciate what you mean, and I'm not gonna lie -  I think ""a CW show with a Netflix"" budget is a pretty good description, but at the same time if you give it a chance i think you'll find yourself getting sucked into the story.  They do a pretty good job of world building and tapping into famous character and story tropes .... while at the same time, it really does go some interesting and surprisingly dark places.  It's definitely not a little kids show.  I think if you watch more of the show you'll get hooked"
The Magicians,"It’s CW-quality with a TV-MA rating.

Make of that what you will."
The Magicians,It’s horny Harry Potter. Pretty good series.
The Magicians,The one and only time I will ever say that it is better than the books.
The Magicians,"Read the books. 

Fuckitty fuck-sticks. I cannot enforce this enough. Maybe I'm biased. I don't care. 

I read the books in high-school about 10 years ago. I loved them. Couldn't put them down. Front to back I stayed up late blurring my eyes reading them. Memorable moments still linger in my mind to this day. Lev Grossman wrote a hilarious, awkward, melancholic, thrilling roller coaster ride of nostalgic parody. 

The show said ""Fuck that, audience wants Riverdale meets Harry Potter.""

I stomached one season of that insult to source material. 

The characters from the book are relatable, flawed, hopeful, struggling adults who are given nothing but what they suffer for. Any hand out is a lie and nobody is special. It's a visceral experience and you can't help but empathize with their mistakes and wrongdoings. 

... Look, the book series was a big inspiration to maturing teenage me. And when they slated production for a show I held out hope for at least a bit of accuracy. Only for it to be absolute trash trying to profit from name recognition. 

Please. Go read the books. They're quite possibly the best works of mature adult fantasy on the market today."
The Magicians,I gave up on it after 2 or 3 episodes
The Magicians,"I tried to watch this show and just hated most of the characters. Like if I met them, I would avoid them as people. Beyond that, the writing isn’t terrible, but also nothing too surprising or fresh. No real big hook. Seems like something a student would write for a creative writing class that took off a little too hard."
The Magicians,"I like the cast and they work together really well. You can see they have fun playing their roles.

But the story is not my cup of tea. Also the actors are way to old. they are playing late teens but they are like 40"
The Magicians,"One of the very few shows to cause a grown man to cry (me) as someone who has been through psychological issues in the past.... a minor mending broke me in a profound way, for those who havent watched the show dont google anything from this comment, definitely worth a watch, the mix of adult Harry Potter, narnia and greek/Roman style lore is incredible."
The Magicians,"I have some pretty strong opinions on this. The show is 5 seasons long. After the first 3, I was telling my friends that it was the best fantasy show I’d ever seen. Seasons 1 and 2 were good but not great, but the second half of season 3 was phenomenal. Season 4 was a colossal failure that broke down what made the show good, and ran into some issues around mental health, queer issues, and sexual violence that really pissed off the fan base. I can no longer recommend the show in good conscience"
The Magicians,I loved that show. Was so sad when it was cancelled. Was hoping for one more season. I loved the musical episodes so much. First season was only ok in my opinion but from season 2 on it was awesome. Few episodes had my sobbing.
The Magicians,There’s one ep just about Elliot and Quentin that was one of the best television iv ever seen. Tears…
The Magicians,This was a show that absolutely surprised me at how good it got and how empty I felt when I finished the last episode. I just wanted more. I’ve never been like that with any show. It honestly just gets better and it has a proper end. And FWIW it didn’t start out as a Netflix show.
The Magicians,Very good. I enjoyed it and finished all seasons. Gets you invested in the characters and cried a few times too- it's like an action/mystery at times too
The Magicians,It's so so bad
The Magicians,"I hated it.  The protagonist is unappealing, his bully seems to be celebrated, his love interest over reacts to something he did and gets revenge on him and made me profoundly dislike her, the bad guy is a let down.  A lot of cliches.  Terrible story writing."
The Magicians,"It's fine.  
But be aware there is a very sudden violent rape scene.  It's very unexpected and goes on for way too long.  And basically everything related to it after is poorly done.  I would like it way more if that wasn't apart of the story."
The Magicians,it's fantastic
The Magicians,"My partner likes the show, but all of the shows on the CW feel corny and are not enjoyable to me generally."
The Magicians,Depends.  Do you like seeing horny teens drink a vial of monster jizz?
The Magicians,The book was utter shit so I imagine the show would be just as terrible.
The Magicians,"ITS SO GOOD!!
I’m actually rewatching it now.. it’s in my top 10 all time favorite shows for sure.."
The Magicians,I loved that show so damn much I named my kid after one of the characters
The Magicians,"The first season is really great. Then it gets a sexual element which is also great. Then further down, I think I fell off by season 3, i remember it getting very annoying, repetitive and too bizarre to want to follow. Some core characters are unbearable. Plus the bad/amateur acting is something people have to try hard to be open minded about, people mention ""low budget"" but what they really mean is poor casting and lack of actor chemistry.

I think a lot of others would agree it's very hard to be motivated to start season 3 or anything after. I'm very forgiving as far as sticking with series even though there's a bad episode or two, but I definitely had to pass with this one. I was very disappointed.

Anyone comparing it to Harry Potter is absolutely incorrect."
The Magicians,The books the series was based off of were way better.
The Magicians,"Spoilers for the few bits I saw, I can't even remember if these are separate episodes but jesus the show was doing some weird stuff. 

My friends recommended it to us and all of us had been watching Riverdale become more and more of a trainwreck and this either came on afterwards or was dvr'd and they just put it on but here's what I remember. 

Space jail

Santa Claus in space jail

All the main characters aren't the main characters, they are other people

Satyrs going to satyr"
Trollhunters,Can't decide if I'm happy that it's coming or sad that this story will be ending.
Trollhunters,Well this was unexpected but welcome
Trollhunters,I enjoyed trollhunters. But the other two series seemed half baked. They re  good but if they put maybe some more time into it they would be just as good trollhunters.
Trollhunters,"Hoping this turns out good... 

Though based on Wizards, it'll probably end up being 'the best it could be, considering the circumstances...', which I would be fine with."
Trollhunters,Tales of arcadia is the best arc of the series!
Trollhunters,r/savedyouaclick
Trollhunters,Interesting
Trollhunters,"How what this series? I see it on Netflix from time to time, but looked off to me."
Trollhunters,GDT
Trollhunters,"Yeah, I agree. The characters just didn't land very well."
Trollhunters,Ahhh that’s tight! Love this universe & how they expand it
Trollhunters,"There's kind of a tv universe going on here. 

Trollhunters is absolutely great

Wizards is pretty great but a bit rushed. You're also supposed to watch it after trollhunters

This movie is kind of a culmination of everything so far"
Trollhunters,"I'm still waiting on Naoki Urasawa's ""Monster"" adaptation."
Trollhunters,"There's been rumors that the team that created Legend of Korra (except for the creators of said show) joined Dreamworks and are working on a new show for them (production title is also rumored to be ""Korra 2.0"", though it won't be a new Avatar series, it will be inspired by the action of it), I wonder if it'll be a Netflix show?

[EDIT: Not a rumor, confirmed by one of the crewmembers of Korra. Here's a post of them working on it alongside other Korra team members.](http://2-cents.tumblr.com/post/114854953369/1st-animatic-edit-on-our-new-project-at)"
Trollhunters,Puss in Boots is a really hilarious children's show.  I enjoy watching it with my son.  Glad it's sticking around.  
Trollhunters,"Sorry Guillermo, but I'm a little distracted that apparently VOLTRON IS COMING TO NETFLIX."
Trollhunters,Holy. Shit. A ttrollhunters series?! That film definitely left me wanting more...and lo and behold more is on it's way!!! 
Trollhunters,"If you've only read the post title, it's this [Trollhunter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WLEEKOA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1) not the recent movie."
Trollhunters,"I love the direction Netflix is heading with its new original content. we've already seen all of our favorite shows on there, so they make us new ones :D"
Trollhunters,Why doesn't Netflix order Hellboy 3?
Trollhunters,I'm still waiting for word on Monster :/
Trollhunters,"https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/684440769902424065

Trollhunters is surprisingly deep into production already"
Trollhunters,I think the real story here is dinotrucks
Trollhunters,"Love Guillermo.

Please don't do The Strain again. 
 It felt like Lost in comparison to his otherwise brilliant work."
Trollhunters,i'll give it 10 months before Del Toro will walk away
Trollhunters,Fuck yeah trollhunters rules 
Trollhunters,I really want Del Toro and Neil Gaiman to partner up.
Trollhunters,"I'm more curious as to what kind of pact it was.

A blood pact, perhaps?"
Trollhunters,[removed]
Trollhunters,That's great
Trollhunters,"Obligatory sad post about Silent Hills / PT. 

That aside, should be fun!"
Trollhunters,Fuck yeah trollhunters rules 
Trollhunters,"Where is my GDT ""At the Mountains of Madness"" adaptation?"
Trollhunters,Fucking Voltron!!!!! Yeaahhhh boooyyyyy!!!
Trollhunters,Isn't Del Toro making a Power Rangers movie? I hope so
Trollhunters,I wish Netflix would just go ahead and fund Hellboy 3 for Del Toro.
Trollhunters,"ooh a del toro series, i hope it;s more mature than the other dreamworks shows"
Trollhunters,Trollhunters? Is this a spin-off of the awesome movie from Norway?
Trollhunters,"I've never really understood Reddit's admiration of Guillermo. Of course the only things that I've seen of his has been Pacific Rim, which was okay. And The Strain, which is truly an awful, awful show."
Trollhunters,"Like all Guillermo projects, I'll believe it when I see it."
Trollhunters,"I love Guillermo, but I'm scared of him spreading himself thin.
"
Trollhunters,"Lol, can't wait to read about Del Toro leaving the project."
Trollhunters,"Aside from that pushy SJW escapade of dullness - Sense 8, I have loved every organic Netflix show I've seen...so I shall look forward to this.

"
Trollhunters,"Dreamworks sucks.  Their animation sucks, so does 90% of their writing, and their humor is very, very bland and forced."
Trollhunters,Dreamworks is run by pedofiles #truth
Trollhunters,I'm sure all three of us are still frothing for it.

Trollhunters,"Status update from October 2015:
>**It's still at HBO?**

>**Guillermo del Toro:** No, it's out of HBO, and now we're going to take it to other places but it's not active active until we pitch it. We are going to other companies to pitch it and see if anyone wants to do it. We finished writing a couple of the episodes, and so we have a sampler. We're going to go and see what happens with that, but very likely that will happen somewhere next year.

Trollhunters,"or perhaps Pluto.

I'd be ecstatic for either, though. They'd fit a netflix series so fucking well, holy shit."
Trollhunters,"Do you hear that? That's the sound of thousands of redditors cumming in their pants, all at once. "
Trollhunters,"So all the animators and writers of Korra, just not including Mke and Brian?

"
Trollhunters,Are you fucking with me? I feel like you're fucking with me.
Trollhunters,they are working on a graphic novel right now though aren't they?
Trollhunters,"Is it appropriate to ask here, wtf happened to the avatar series? I watched up to the uhh, ying yang fish and the battle at the frozen waterbenders area with the bloodmoon or whatever? Did the series take off even more after that? You can shoot me down for asking in wrong area."
Trollhunters,"The team that created it...
Except the creators."
Trollhunters,"So there's a rumor that some people, except for those people, are working on a new project. *What?*"
Trollhunters,is that tina fey?
Trollhunters,Anyone else think that Lauren Montgomery looks like Tina Fey?
Trollhunters,I literary nutted in my pants reading this post.
Trollhunters,I don't want Korra 2.0. I want The Last Airbender redone in blu ray quality.
Trollhunters,Please let it be Korrasami:  The Hentai.
Trollhunters,My wife and I watch it together and we don't have a child. It is a good show.
Trollhunters,Please have Guillermo make live action VOLTRON:Pacific Rim
Trollhunters,"Can one die of hype? If so, I think I'm pretty close to that."
Trollhunters,"I wouldn't get too excited about this yet.  My son watched a bit of the newer [Voltron Force](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1669774/) lately, which is also on Netflix right now.  It's not nearly as good as what I grew up with.  I'll remain skeptical until I know more."
Trollhunters,Now we just need gundam wing.
Trollhunters,"I really hope they can do a modernized version of the old cartoon instead of making it look too ""clean"".

Trollhunters,That reminds me of my favorite comic.. http://pbfcomics.com/186/
Trollhunters,"Dreamworks Animation reimagining Voltron?

I... I just see lots of crude jokes and cheesy musical numbers in the future."
Trollhunters,"There is Trollhunter, a 2010 Norwegian film and then there is Trollhunters, a 2015 book written by Del Toro.  This will be based on Del Toro's book."
Trollhunters,"It's based off his novel, not the Norwegian movie"
Trollhunters,I did some quick googling after reading the thread title and was disappointed for the same reason. Trollhunter was such a dope film.
Trollhunters,With Guillermo Del Toro at the helm no less.  Can't wait.
Trollhunters,"Yeah poor choice of name, del Toro."
Trollhunters,I don't think its the same. The film was a parable about Norwegian identity and history...this is...bound to be not/shit.
Trollhunters,That sucks because the film looked like it could have made a good series as well. It's definitely worth a watch www.imdb.com/title/tt1740707/
Trollhunters,Trollhunters*
Trollhunters,"I feel like that would be a little outside their budget range, even for Netflix. Those movies are really effects-heavy. "
Trollhunters,There's no way Netflix could afford that shit.
Trollhunters,"Maybe animated they can pull it off to decrease the budget significantly, but it would be a waste to have del Toro's eye not being used for live action with Hellboy."
Trollhunters,"I like where you're going but we want to make a few TINY changes. Instead of calling it Hellboy 3, the execs prefer Bellboy 1. We save a ton on effects, mostly because the Bellboy is just Micheal Cera. Then, he's still an outcast because the elite guests he serves look down on him. Then one day he saves a rich lady's poodle from getting caught in the revolving door and... Well you get the idea. Come back to us in a few months with a new script and we'll look it over."
Trollhunters,His stop-motion Pinocchio film was in production for three years before it disappeared. This guy has dropped out of more projects than he's finished. 
Trollhunters,Lost was much better than that.
Trollhunters,"Yeah, the only work I've seen of his was The Strain (which I quit half way into Season 2 as I had enough), so I wasn't too excited by this initial Netflix news.

Reading this thread however, it seems The Strain was just a misfire for Guillermo? I always thought it lacked the budget to be as ambitious as Guillermo wanted it to be."
Trollhunters,"> It felt like Lost in comparison to his otherwise brilliant work.

one of the Lost showrunners *is* the showrunner on the Strain"
Trollhunters,"Any show that has a scene where all the main characters are lined up for a supposed finale fight instantly loses my interest. The strains season final for season 1 is where the show tanked hard. They are all lined up in that theater house and the mobs come at each character one at a time. 

Plus there seems to be little to no suspense.  Everyone seems to be safe except one character every finale and any new character added (heroes is my all time favorite example of a show dying from this) If they want people to enjoy it start killing off characters and adding new characters. The show was setup to be an awesome horror suspense show.

Show a random survivalist and how he is managing to stay alive in the surrounding woods. He does not need to meet every character in the show. Game of thrones is fun because everyone feels vulnerable. I would love to see how nurses, survivalists, government officials, real criminals (not that horrible thug plot like), and dozens of other characters survive or die. Instead it's just over the top with every character shown playing some extreme role to help or hinder the main villain. Which everyone only really cares about the old man fighting the main vamp. 

The old man should never of met anyone and he is just hunting the main vamp. The doctors should of been in their own world and failed. The exterminator should of only met that  hacker and ran off to a sunny island. The thug should of died in a way that has no impact on the show.  Plus new characters are added that never meet a majority of the other cast. 

This little merry band of heroes is so painful to deal with. "
Trollhunters,"> It felt like Lost in comparison to his otherwise brilliant work.

There is nothing brilliant about anything Del Toro has ever done. 

-  Hellboy
-  Hellboy 2
-  Blade 2
-  Pacific Rim
-  The Strain
-  The Hobbit movies

When are you people going to see the light? Those movies and shows are all bad. "
Trollhunters,That long?
Trollhunters,"This would be my dream. American Gods (yes i know it's being slowly made by Stars) written by Gaiman and directed by Del Toro. With Donald Sutherland as Wednesday, The Rock as Shadow, a resurected Sammy Davis Jr as Mr Nancy, Peter Stormare as Czernobog and Christina Hendricks as Easter."
Trollhunters,">  Does Netflix not have perpetual rights to these shows?


Idk if they have ""perpetual rights"" to anything but their original content. 


>Are all of DreamWorks's 1600+ episodes of TV going to effectively disappear whenever their deal with Netflix ends?


If they don't renew,  sure.  Things come off netflix all the time. 


>great! I just hate it when things become completely unavailable to watch and/or purchase anywhere.


Learn how to internet and just DL everything not on Netflix.  "
Trollhunters,Or reboot it with him. 
Trollhunters,"Unfortunately, no."
Trollhunters,"People like him for his earlier work, and his monsters. Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, the Devil's Backbone, Cronos, etc are all his earlier works that get singled out."
Trollhunters,So maybe watch his more highly rated work? Duh.
Trollhunters,Dude go watch pan's labyrinth.
Trollhunters,"Watch Pan's labirinth, my favorite movies  of his and three times oscar winner. Also both Hellboy movies are really good.
"
Trollhunters,He made some great movies before he shifted his focus to getting involved in projects that are never completed.
Trollhunters,"Pan's Labyrinth and the first Hellboy are really good. Guillermo is kind of hit-and-miss, but there's almost always something enjoyable in his movies."
Trollhunters,Go watch Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy.
Trollhunters,"The Del Toro admirers are bizarre. They loved to get hyped for the guys next project yet those projects are never any good.

Del Toro makes lousy movies. I have watch the Del Toro cult work themselves into a lather every time there is an article like this. Half of these sorts of announcements never turn into anything and the half that do are just BAD. "
Travelers,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Travelers,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Travelers,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Travelers,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Travelers,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Travelers,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Travelers,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Travelers,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Travelers,[deleted]
Travelers,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Travelers,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Travelers,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Travelers,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Travelers,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Travelers,Travelers is a good time travel show
Travelers,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Travelers,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Travelers,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Travelers,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Travelers,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Travelers,Love this show so much.
Travelers,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Travelers,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Travelers,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Travelers,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Travelers,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Travelers,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Travelers,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Travelers,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Travelers,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Travelers,"great show
always recommend it"
Travelers,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Travelers,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Travelers,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Travelers,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Travelers,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Travelers,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Travelers,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Travelers,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Travelers,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Travelers,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Travelers,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Travelers,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Travelers,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Travelers,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Travelers,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Travelers,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Travelers,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Travelers,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Travelers,Someone must have never seen futurama
Travelers,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Travelers,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Travelers,I think Dark has something to say about this
Travelers,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Travelers,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Travelers,Good summer binge show
Travelers,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Travelers,[deleted]
Travelers,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Travelers,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Travelers,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Travelers,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Travelers,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Travelers,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Travelers,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Travelers,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Travelers,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Travelers,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Travelers,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
Travelers,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Travelers,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Travelers,Very nice
Travelers,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
Travelers,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Travelers,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Travelers,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Travelers,Dude spoiler!
Travelers,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Travelers,Upgrade!
Travelers,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
Travelers,Shame about *The Rig*.
Travelers,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Travelers,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Travelers,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Travelers,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Travelers,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
Travelers,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I’m 4 episodes in now and I’m loving it.
Travelers,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
Travelers,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
Travelers,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
Travelers,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
Travelers,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.
Travelers,[deleted]
Travelers,"ok, this convinced me to watch it. The movie was ok, not bad but not great as well. Probably the reason why I didn't want to watch the show. I will give it a shot."
Travelers,Is there a place to watch it streaming right now?
Travelers,I think I’ll watch it based on this comment thank you. Same level as dark and mr robot? Sign me up!
Travelers,"Do I need to have seen the movie to enjoy the tv show?

Edit: having discovered the magicians a year or so ago I have changed my tune on syfy shows and am willing to give them a couple episodes of viewing and judge them on their merits. I was definitely one of those “2s” not too long ago"
Travelers,So I read this comment a few days ago and decided to give it a shot because I love breaking bad and better call saul. The plot seems very cool and I love some good time travels stories but the writing is lazy. How many times are they going to have a bad guy at gun point only to hesitate shooting so an explosion can go off and they can escape. It's happened so much that I had to find this comment and say thank you for the recommendation because I am enjoying the show but I can't even begin to put it on the same level as BCS or breaking bad.
Travelers,Legion comes to mind.
Travelers,Interesting to me that you felt they added filler in those seasons. Season 3 and 4 were mapped out from start to finish after season 2 so everything was planned out. I guess I can understand some instances but at that point the show was just having so much fun I didn't care in the slightest.
Crayon Shin-chan,"This is a really old article, but they’ve just been uploaded as Amazon Originals outside of Japan today."

wouldn't it be easier to just make a new cast even if they look similar, and not have to deal with the questions?"

Those were only for a summer though."

The Break,"The Office between season 2 and 3 is a good one. 

I will add Westworld between seasons 1 and 2."
The Break,Surprised no one has said The Walking Dead.  That cliffhanger felt like it had the entire nation by the balls for the off season
The Break,"I think all the Lost seasons ended with massive cliffhangers of the sort you described, though I think the season 1 finale was the most ""why you leave me hangin'?"" of them all.  

Battlestar Galactica - Season 3 finale - quite a lot there but the very end was just such a real ""WTF just happened?"" moment."
The Break,"Most recently the final season of Better Call Saul being split up. ""Okay, let's talk."""
The Break,"The reboot show ""V"" by ABC ended on a cliff hanger because there was supposed to be a next season, but there wasn't.

(Spoilers, if you care) the show ended with multiple main characters being killed and the likely destruction of humanity. It was an unintentionally very depressing ending."
The Break,">Historically, Who Shot J.R.? On Dallas was huge, but that was before my time but I’ve always heard that was an absolutely, monumentally, humongous, can’t-miss event for the reveal.

>This probably doesn’t come anywhere close to Dallas

we'll never see that again because there are too many other things on TV now, and if you miss the premiere.. so what - everything is on demand. Dallas was ""one of three programs"" on television between 9 and 10 or whatever and if you missed it, you MISSED IT until they rebroadcast..  in those days, if you were a fan of a show, you stuck with it because there's no way to get caught up in the shows on other channels.

&#x200B;

I was too young to even CARE about Dallas but i remember the hype.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday\_night\_death\_slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot)

The term possibly began as a reflection of certain programs' dominance of Friday night in the 1980s and 1990s, which resulted in decreased ratings for those scheduled opposite their competitors.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] By the 2000s, it was used in reference to the belief that young, single Americans rarely watch television on Friday or Saturday nights, thereby removing from the household what is considered the most lucrative demographic for advertisers.\[4\]\[5\] **With the collapse of the traditional network viewing model where viewers had to be in front of the TV to watch shows (and then the evolution from VCR or DVR capabilities to almost all shows being viewed increasingly through on-demand streaming media), the stigma of Friday night scheduling is much less evident or considered today than in the past.**"

The Break,"Farscape had amazing cliffhangers. Season two was so good, that when it got cancelled in my country on free TV, I learned the new season was available in Paytv. So I got myself Paytv, which wasn't cheap.

After season three and another killer cliffhanger it was cancelled entirely in my country. So no more dubbed versions. Season four was my starting point of watching shows in English.

Season 4 had again a cliffhanger that left me screaming. First because we already knew that the series was cancelled and two the cliffhanger it self. And a year later we got the mini series. I was very lucky 😃."
The Break,It's been 6 months and I still can't stop thinking about the Severance season finale.

The Break,"One of the recent Chicago Fire seasons ended with the rescue squad guys trapped under a capsized boat in Lake Michigan and their tanks were running out I think. The final shot of the season was like the ambulance medics standing on the pier watching for someone to surface and nothing out there.

Then when the new season came back they got out of danger in like 30 seconds and it really wasn't a problem at all and that annoyed me."

Better call Saul season 5 finale was intense I don’t know how I waited two years for season 6."

The Break,"I started watching Lost between the final two seasons, so the only cliffhanger I ever needed to really wait for was >!Juliet setting off the bomb!<. I really miss that level of engaging with a show, my friends and I (I was in college at the time) would just throw theories around it was so much fun."
The Break,"""We have to go back to the Island!""

I don't remember if that was a season finale or premiere, but I remember that final line blowing my mind."
The Break,"Lost wasnt just season cliff hangers.  It was weekly.  You’d watch an episode on Wednesday and talk about it and think about it all week obsess over it until next Wednesday and it would start over.

Love streaming but miss that type of streaming sometimes.  Some shows would benefit from it.   And we get little glimpses of it Only Murders in the Building gives me the same sort of weekly mystery cliffhanger sometimes."
The Break,Also Hank on the toilet
The Break,"The rumor was, Patrick Stewart wanted out of his contract, and this would be how they kill off Picard.  So yeah, I was a little more invested in this cliffhanger than most others."
The Break,One of Riker's most badass moments too
The Break,Yes. But I only had to wait until the next day. We were behind in Germany and episodes aired daily.
The Break,"It was a good cliffhanger but in retrospect the resolution wouldn't really hold up to modern tv standards. 

Picard is kidnapped, basically indoctrinated, leads a battle that slaughters a significant portion of Starfleet, and they just put him back in command of the enterprise immediately, despite the fact that he is clearly suffering from debilitating ptsd for decades after to the point where they can't bring the federation flagship to help defend earth in first contact because he can't be trusted.  And that is ignoring the justifiably awful position that puts any survivors of wolf 359 having to work with him (sisko for example).  

He shouldn't have gone to jail or anything, it wasn't his fault, but there is no way he ever should have set foot on the bridge of a starship again.  Let alone been put back in command of the flagship.  And then, Will Riker basically saves humanity and gets demoted back to commander for it.  After president has already been set that someone can hold the rank of captain and still be first officer (Spock)."
The Break,"Oh yeah, now THAT was a good one."
The Break,"The end of the first season with the hatch is still the best.


Also, the Others."
The Break,"The BSG cliffie was also great because of all the fakeout Bionic Woman casting stuff, hiding that the actor wasn’t actually leaving the show to go to the creators other show like they were all insinuating in the trades, now that is a stunt I haven’t seen repeated"
The Break,What a roller coaster!
The Break,"I really liked the cliffhanger ending of Chicago Fire season two, trapping the entire cast inside a collapsing burning building except for one actor and only seeing that actor reacting outside the building was a great way to play it. Definitely spent the summer thinking about what happened inside, sounds similar to the one you mentioned with a less is more approach. Wish they hadn’t iced that particular character in the two cliffhanger however it was that actors choice and they made it count"
The Break,That was serious nightmare fuel
The Break,"They work, though. Gets people talking about the show and keeps them hyped for the new season.

The Simpsons ""Who shot Mr Burns"" one had endless discussions and bets."
The Break,"Why Smithers?

He was a true Burns sycophant if ever there was one."
The Break,"It was S3 finale and it also had the ""Not Penny's Boat"" cliffhanger. Lost casually dropping two absolutely huge cliffhangers lol.

And the thing was that Lost had that so many times not just for big episodes like finales. The ending of every episode is a test of your will if you don't want to binge watch that lol. That LOST logo and sound appearing at the end follow some of the best cliffhanger ever"
The Break,"Season finale and the reveal that the season were flash forwards, not flashbacks."
The Break,Oh damn yea that’s even better
The Break,"Yeah, the hatch plus Walt and the Raft was just crazy"
The Break,Worth it!
The Break,"I know you're trying to avoid spoilers but is that the one where a couple of characters switched places from how they would normally go and then something fell on one of them?

I think I'm avoiding revealing anything for people who haven't seen it."
The Break,We were 13 and went with the obvious.
The Break,"The season 3 finale with ""we have to go back"" was the first flash forward. It didn't reveal the whole season had been a flash forward just that episode. The rest of season 3 was flashbacks."
The Break,The hype was so massive that it had a gravitational pull that it created at least a hundred podcast discussing the show...then the writers strike happened.
The Break,"Yes, that’s the one. Having arguably their best actor (who seemed the most likely to die) just slowly start to lose it while listening to things meltdown on the radio for everyone else really stuck with me"
The Break,"That’s fair.

Was Maggie a good choice, though? It seems like a bit of a cop out because they tried to go with perhaps the one character probably no one sees coming and a character that they never need to follow up on shooting another character because it’s a baby so cannot be arrested.

Although I guess if they wanted to they could have just had Bart or another major character do it in a self-contained story and still avoid having to follow up on it in the same sort of way."
The Break,It time for a rewatch then. I am starting to forget.
The Break,"The writers strike didn't actually affect lost. They made half a season before the strike and 5 more episodes after it ended, so they only missed a couple planned episodes from season 4 and added the number to 5 and 6."
The Break,">Breaking Bad’s pilot episode aired 15 years ago this Jan. 20, and it’s one of the best introductions in the history of the medium. 

i agree

also, fuck, i'm old."
The Break,"It seems hard to believe now but BB was not a big hit during this first season.  I remember trying to talk about it with people and nobody knew what it was and didn't want to watch it.  As soon as you'd mention who was in it, they'd say it sounded stupid that the dad from Malcom in the Middle was a drug dealer."
The Break,"I just did a rewatch of it, and I noticed even from the very first episode the characters were exactly who they were, if that makes sense.

Lotta shows take their time to really develop, but Breaking Bad really hit the ground running."
The Break,One of the all time great pilots.
The Break,And the rest is history.....
The Break,"I still remember explained the premise of the show to my brother before it debuted, and we both assumed it was a comedy due to Bryan Cranston (who we both only knew as Hal)"
The Break,One of the all time great TV series!
The Break,"When this show came out, it didn't get a lot of buzz. I thought it was a comedy starring Malcolm's dad who walked around in his underwear (judging by the poster image) who happened to be a high school teacher. I didn't even know about the cancer/meth storyline until my brother shoved the DVDs in my hand and said ""Just watch it"" and I was hooked. Watched every episode when it aired after that."
The Break,The breaking bad pilot is a work of art.
The Break,"The opening shot of the khakis flying through the wind, followed up by the winnebago smashing down the desert road. Yup, greatness indeed was foretold."
The Break,"Not sure about that, I gave up before the end of the first season because it was shite."
The Break,"One of the best pilots I ever saw. It's perfectly paced and equal parts dark and hilarious, with a bunch of memorable character introductions and some utterly crazy moments."
The Break,"I don’t think BB really took off until the Gus seasons. I could be wrong though, but either way it was a slow start for how huge the show got"
The Break,"I’m one of those people where I had no idea where it was even supposed to be going so I didn’t really have an interest.

Weirdly, I sat in while my brother watched the finale episode and that made me want to watch it. There’s a different way of watching a show when you know where it’s going, it’s kind of comforting and easy to watch through without questioning why things are happening. It’s all part of the plan.

Seeing where it ended, then jumping to this timid guy being bullied by his students was fucking nuts."
The Break,"An eye opener for me was the fact that Walt manipulated Jesse from their very first conversation (cook meth with me or I turn you in). The manipulation stuff doesn't really factor in until the later seasons, so its nice to see the groundwork was there since the VERY beginning."
The Break,"It really is one of the most succinct pilots I’ve ever seen. It tells you everything you need to know about our major characters and their personalities/relationships and sets up his diagnosis as the catalyst that drives the rest of the show forward. No wasted time whatsoever, the show just starts up immediately"
The Break,hahahaha this that meme where the guy stops digging before he hits diamonds lmao
The Break,"I don’t think it *really* took off until after Gus to be honest. It was always quite a niche show that had cult status, then between seasons 4 and 5 everyone seemed to binge it and it was everywhere."
The Break,At the time most of my friends got hooked on BB where I was on the opposite end and got hooked at the second half of season  3. Definitely a slow start though.
The Break,"Can’t seem to find the link, but it only had minor growth in ratings until the wait between pt1 & pt2 of s5, when everyone started watching it on Netflix"
The Break,I feel like a bunch of people saw the clip of season 4’s ending and just got obsessed with it
The Break,"You’re right that’s what I’m thinking of, it was the break for the final episodes. It just exploded into popular culture then"
The Break,"Netflix and BB really helped each other. In the US people binged it in the lead up to S5 and here in the UK Netflix was basically just ""the Breaking Bad service"" lol. Only place to watch it and it was the most notable show they had circa 2013

That mutual success is why Vince sold the international rights to BCS to Netflix and produced El Camino with them."
The Break,Until Jesse’s younger brother gets abducted by criminals in ABQ desperate to lure Heisenberg’s apprentice back to New Mexico so he can teach them how to cook blue meth.
The Break,His voice sounded so different in the last Better Call Saul episode he was in.
The Break,"I love him, I love Jesse, the only way to see him again would be in Alaska and... just no. That was his happy ending. Don't need to dredge that up again. Besides, between Walt and Jimmy, if we went back to Jesse, that would imply that Ed's services are shoddy. Yes, I know that Walt and Jimmy bailed on their own."
The Break,"In 12 years when Holly gets a show and interviews Saul in prison to learn more about her dad, leading to a tip to find pink man, he’ll do it."
The Break,Good. I'm very happy with his Better Call Saul appearance but let's move on.
The Break,[deleted]
The Break,Still wouldn't surprise me if someday we get a show or movie about his life in Alaska lots of people have changed there minds about stuff like this
The Break,Greatly impressed by his performance in s4ep06 of Westworld a few weeks ago. Aaron Paul has really improved as an actor.
The Break,"1) I don't blame him at all. It's all so perfect. There's no need to see these characters again. It could only cheapen the story.

2) I am devastated and would give anything to see Jesse Pinkman, Walter White and Saul Goodman again. I miss them so much already."
Call My Agent!,Why even rebooting a show that is already worldwide?
Call My Agent!,"Just why? The show is perfect, learn to accept subtitles you big babies."
Call My Agent!,"The show is already good by itself, there's literally no reason to remake with Americans"
Call My Agent!,We are so cool we are hot
Call My Agent!,[deleted]
Call My Agent!,I hate assholes who post this paywall shit. Whats the point? 1/10 people can read the damn thing unless they sign up for a bullshit account.
Call My Agent!,"Oh, there's a reason. It's called *easy money*."
Call My Agent!,What? There’s literally one line mentioning France in the whole article.
Call My Agent!,Content is king I guess
Call My Agent!,but it's the title
Call My Agent!,Then you got clickbaited.
Call My Agent!,"jokes on you, I didn't click"
Call My Agent!,But here you are talking about it soooo… who’s gonna tell him?
Call My Agent!,This show is wonderful
Call My Agent!,"I love this show but the ending truly upset me. **********SPOILER********


I feel like this show was just 4 seasons describing the death of ASK after the death of its founder. After investing so much into the characters and the story line, I was disappointed. Also season 4 felt too rushed, causing characters to do things out of character 
To advance the story line. Ugh."
Call My Agent!,So good. Really excited for a new season.
Call My Agent!,My favorite!
Call My Agent!,Has anyone one seen the Turkish one? I’m currently watching it and I love it. I’m curious how it compares to the original one?
Call My Agent!,Agreed.  Funny and well acted.
Call My Agent!,"It really is. 

Yo did Hicham annoy you or was it just me? Dude was uncomfortably pushy at times."
Call My Agent!,"What an ending for Andrea. After overcoming one obstacle with another, Andrea loses almost everything. Hopefully she becomes a writer. 

I still feel bitter about the ending."
Call My Agent!,"Same although I was disappointed when I watched the trailer and saw Hicham I didn't really enjoy his character, it always felt like he was an inch from stepping over the line."
Call My Agent!,Same I was so happy to click the article and see that a new season was dropping feels like it's been forever.
Call My Agent!,Hated him from start to finish. Absolutely inappropriate dude.
Call My Agent!,me too :(
Call My Agent!,It does because it has! :)
Call My Agent!,"Yeah when they had sex, shit felt uncomfortable it was so aggressive. Plus he was a dick to his son, I like that he wasn't as shown in the latest season."
Call My Agent!,"I was uncomfortable about that whole storyline. Glad they didn't turn that into some bullshit love triangle at least. 

I think I was most outraged when he threw a pencil at her at work when she walked away from him. His demands were OTT and unprofessional and he was as horrible of a boss as he was a dad."
Call My Agent!,"Yeah Im glad they cut that shit off too,  I was surprised Colette came back for the baby but was not surprised when she left again. Yeah he was just an ass in every way."
Call My Agent!,"I wasn't surprised she came back. Andrea has her faults, but Colette was absolutely in love with her in spite of them (still is). Plus, she couldn't have kids herself, so this was a shit sandwich she could deal with if he didn't play daddy. 

Definitely agree with her leaving. But I really hope the movie gives us some decent time and closure for them."
Call My Agent!,"Your right Colette does love Andrea immensely, but the job kept them apart like crazy. Plus yeah hicham not being in the picture was a big plus for her.

I'm pretty sure there's gonna be a movie and another season, which I'm excited for. But Andrea might not be in it with the way things ended last season. I honestly really liked the way they ended the season though, it was for lack of a better word cute."
Call My Agent!,"Yeah, it was pretty sweet. 

I heard the new season might have a whole new cast of agents? Is that right? I heard the movie would have the original cast though."
Call My Agent!,"I didn't really see anything about cast changes tbh,  but a new cast makes sense with the way the last season ended. They give the old cast a movie to wrap things up and then move on to a new group."
Call My Agent!,"Agree. I'd watch it with a new cast. I didn't know anyone on this show when it first came out, so no difference to me if the writing is just as entertaining. Although, for the love of god, I hope they have someone as compelling (and hot) as Camille Cottin haha."
Call My Agent!,I saw two seasons of Call My Agent so far and it is brilliant. I will check this French show too. Netflix is making so many good foreign shows which is why they are much better than other streaming services.
Call My Agent!,"Good news: [there might be hope yet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/15/call-my-agent-the-french-tv-hit-that-viewers-and-actors-adore).

“There will certainly be a film, in any case,” the producer told Europe 1 radio recently. “And France Télévisions have said they are keen for some kind of fifth series. We’re thinking about it. We may even try to make it in the States.”"
Call My Agent!,"I enjoyed the fourth season a lot but the ending felt somewhat rushed to me. Andrea and Gabriel barely talking the entire season and not having a single scene together in the finale was particularly upsetting to me, their friendship was one of the best parts of the show, and he and Andrea never even get to talk about him moving to Starmedia! 

Also, I kinda hate that they left Andrea's future out in the open like that. I appreciated her final scene with Colette so much, she was finally able to be honest and admit to them both that, despite loving Colette, she couldn't force herself into being someone that she's not, so she was done making promises she couldn't keep. And then the end has Andrea quitting her life as an agent, apparently for good? None of the other agents loved their jobs as much as Andrea did, it's a huge part of who she is, so what happened to her being done trying to be someone she's not? I wanted her to learn to prioritize a little bit better and put her family first but it almost feels unfair that she had to quit altogether while Mathias was just as bad as her - if not worse - and managed to get everything he wanted with seemingly very little consequence. 

I really wish they would have given us a flash forward or something so we could actually see what she ended up doing. Maybe a future movie could make that happen, idk."
Call My Agent!,"Yesss someone gets it, finally. The subreddit for this show is so dead, nowhere to gush with my fellow dix pour cent'ers. Thanks for saying this!

Are there even any other shows like this? I feel like the Paris location and language made it so unique but I'm up for anything comparable."
Call My Agent!,A season five has been announced https://www.reddit.com/r/callmyagent
Call My Agent!,"About to start watching this, looks good :)"
Call My Agent!,"No, season 4 will be the last one, sorry"
Call My Agent!,"This is the news I've been waiting to hear. 

I have loved this show for years and the ending was so disappointing. I can't believe that Andrea would be so stupid to a female Matthias, given how long she distrusted him."
Call My Agent!,Oh sweet Jesus please do🙏🏾🙏🏾
Call My Agent!,Your post has legitimately made my day (how sad am I)
Call My Agent!,"Couldn’t agree more. Andrea was definitely on a downward spiral this season and all but left the Agency tank by being oblivious to all the red flags. I was ready for her to lick her wound and get back up. Because while it’s hard to see a lead spiraling out a great comeback makes it worth it.

Her just giving up felt incomplete especially as it not as if she’s giving to be fully committed to Colette. That too was left open ended.

Camille opening her family agency with her Dad is a natural evolution and I actually liked that although ASK will always be the best😜

It’s true that Gabriel was a bit aimless this season it seems like his whole arc was to get back with Sophie. I did miss their friendship (Gabriel and Andrea) and I hate that they didn’t have a heart to heart as well, Andrea delegating it to Sophia felt weird.

Apparently there’s been talk of a movie and i’ll take that if a season is too much. I will take a movie picking up after a time jump seeing where everyone is and is ASK is truly dead? How is fairing at Star Media? Can Mathias resist to urge to completely take over his daughter’s agency?  because let’s be honest Mathias will Mathias.

I just need some closure😭😭"
Call My Agent!,"The only show that’s somewhat comparable in my mind is Mad Men, but it’s still pretty different (more characters, slower at times, obviously a different industry and time period)."
Call My Agent!,FUCK YES!!!!!!! I knew these mofos wouldn’t just go down like that
Call My Agent!,With the huge success for this series there might be a movie.
Call My Agent!,"Eek watch out this is kind of a spoiler! 

I have literally never hated a character more than that one. My word."
Call My Agent!,Great they are doing more Andrea stuff. Its a really good show with some hilarious episodes. The Monica Belucci one is hilarious
Call My Agent!,Really glad to have stumbled upon this show. I love it.
Call My Agent!,This is amazing. Really didn't expect it to be renewed again. Its really picked up a hell of a lot of steam internationally.
Call My Agent!,"Holy shit, I just screamed out loud! Binged this show two weeks ago after putting it off for years. I'm so happy right now.

>Star Camille Cottin has since found success in English language projects and will next be seen in crime drama Stillwater with Matt Damon and Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci with Lady Gaga.

This bit makes me even happier. She needs to be a huge Hollywood star like, yesterday. English won't be a problem either, since she used to be an English teacher.

Edit: oh no...

>The series will take place after the film but will reportedly be a reboot with a new cast of agents."
Call My Agent!,"Sweet! The final episode really felt like an ending, but I'm always happy for more."
Call My Agent!,Zut alors!
Call My Agent!,this is great news. i thought it was canceled/finished after watching the s4 finale
Call My Agent!,It ended perfectly so I never expected this. Thanks
Call My Agent!,"Just discovered this show 2 weeks ago and am devouring it! Also studied French at university (yeah, *super-useful Humanities degree* meme) and this is low-key making me want to get re-certified in French and try working in Paris if I can."
Call My Agent!,The Bureau is simply the best modern spy show ever
Call My Agent!,"Season 4 only premiered in France October 16, it’s probably going to be a bit."
Call My Agent!,They havent said what they are planning to do with the shows upcoming season yet so id just be patient and keep an eye on it. They will release the dates soon
Call My Agent!,"Assuming you're talking about the US, there hasn't been a release date announced."
Call My Agent!,I didn't know there was another season! This makes my day!
Call My Agent!,"Just so you know, Netflix UK just announced it returns on 21 Jan.

Call My Agent!,"Could be COVID delays, they may be working slower and deprioritized it for later."
Call My Agent!,The first three seasons hit Netflix in Dec and Jan.  Just renewed for season 5 as well:)
Call My Agent!,I just live chatted with Netflix “help” center. They do not have season 4 scheduled for purchase at the moment in USA. Sooo sad
Call My Agent!,Thank you so much  hopefully the Netflix US announcement follows
Call My Agent!,Monica Bellucci's appearance made her so human and likable
Call My Agent!,"I prefer the original French title, but I can understand why Netflix changed it."
Call My Agent!,Will definitely give this a watch thanks!
Call My Agent!,Do love this show.
Call My Agent!,I binged the hell outta this last year. Hugely entertaining. So good.
Call My Agent!,[deleted]
Call My Agent!,I don't mind watching other movies /shows in another language with subtitles but for comedy specifically you miss a lot of the subtitles of comedic timing because you're reading the subtitles. Which is why I didn't care to finish club de cuervos on Netflix.
Call My Agent!,Second season was terrible.   Entourage is much more fun to watch
Call My Agent!,"I love how they are willing to really lean in hard on showing themselves with lots of flaws, vanity, cluelessness, selfishness. Actors acting at being themselves. They have all been wonderfully charming (especially Guy)!"
Call My Agent!,Skip it.   It’s not very good.
Call My Agent!,Bummer.😒
Call My Agent!,"Entourage is fun so long as you ignore that the stars of it would be villains in any other show.

They are the definition of failing upwards.  It would be a semi-decent show if any of them grew throughout it but they stay the same juvenile selfish entitled pieces of shit.

The supposed ""good guy"" of the show treats Sloan the same way an abusive boyfriend would despite Sloan forgiving him time and again.  Which may speak to how a battered wife goes back to the abusive partner...

On a long enough timeline the main cast would be walking up those stairs in crutches alongside Weinstein.

The one laugh Entourage ever gave anyone is when Mark Reviewed the movie.

Call My Agent!,"Have to have a HARD disagree on both of those! The second season revels in is ability to attract more famous stars and the climax at the Canne festival is a delight! But, whatever floats your boat. 🤓"
Call My Agent!,Don’t take it too seriously.   It’s not that type of show
Call My Agent!,"Lol the entire show is average AT BEST.  Entourage as a whole isn’t anything mind blowing, but the star power alone blow this little mediocre show out of the water.   It’s not even close lol.   Like, at all."
Call My Agent!,"Dude, whatever floats your boat. We get it, you didn't like it.  Lay off spamming the comments,  no one gets to decide what other people like!"
Call My Agent!,"NOOOOOOOOO!

Hope this means it gets a really great resolution though. Ive enjoyed every second of it so far."
Call My Agent!,Is there anywhere I could watch this with english subtitles?
Call My Agent!,My heart 💔💔💔💔💔💔
Call My Agent!,Wait. I thought it was done? Still more? Fucking A. Great show
Call My Agent!,It's available on Netflix U.S.
Call My Agent!,It's a Netflix original outside France. Dubbed and subbed.
Call My Agent!,If you ever wonder about a show just check JustWatch!
Call My Agent!,PM me and I'll share my server with you. You can watch it there if you want.
Call My Agent!,"Just watched the first episode. I suspect there's some cultural nuances I am not picking up on and the characters (especially Gabriel) seem a bit overly dramatic. But overall, I enjoyed it! Will add it to my queue. Thanks for the recommendation 🙂. "
Call My Agent!,Excellent!  Thanks for letting me know :)  I'm glad you enjoyed it!
Call My Agent!,"> The first episode of this new season opened with the Oscar-winning actor Jean Dujardin (The Artist, Möbius, The Wolf of Wall Street) as the guest star for this episode. 

> This is the particularity of this series. For each episode, a well-known actor is invited to play themselves, or rather a version of themselves. The first two seasons saw big names from the French film industry, such as Nathalie Baye, Cécile de France, Fabrice Luchini, Isabelle Adjani, and Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche. The series reveals the world of film star agents and the dramas that can arise during and around film shoots. Each episode is well-written with some very comic moments, not shying away from showing the whims of well-known actors."
Call My Agent!,"I love that show so much, can't wait for Season 3 next month (Netflix, USA).

I thought Jean Dujardin was very funny in the OSS 117 movies."
Call My Agent!,Ok

I mean, he's still popular and acting in movies in France"

Borderline,My husband pointed out that it's a bunch of chucklefucks blundering their way through a D&D campaign and it's really helped me appreciate it.
Borderline,"I just think the show lacks good characters and the storytelling and tone are inconsistent. The movie was fun but this almost feels like it’s trying *too* hard to be fun… but then it also has scenes where silly, quirky forest ladies in denim are introduced then immediately butchered."
Borderline,Its sequel to a movie where the baby makes “Jim faces” at the camera from time to time reacting to whats going on. Didn’t these people watch it first?
Borderline,I love the film. The show just isn’t clicking with me though. I watched the first 4 episodes and that’s enough for me. A scene that stands out for me is when Willow and Sorsha were sitting at a table and talking about Elora and some future danger. I thought the acting from Warwick there was just awful.
Borderline," It's consistent with the film. People expecting it to be serious high fantasy are in for a disappointment. The original film is almost nonstop forward motion from one bumbling situation to another. Mad Martigan was a good swordsman but in four sequential events has a baby stolen from him, pretends to be a woman, falls in love with his enemy due to a love potion, and becomes a human snowball as he falls head over heels down a cliff."
Borderline,"I am a huge fan of the original film. The new show lacks a certain reverence for its own fantasy setting that is a bit jarring. People were less aloof and the magic was more substantial. As a fan of the original, I was disappointed with Episode 1 as it missed the potential completely.

However; what they did make is fun to watch. The characters are even dumber than in the original film, and there is more fantasy shenanigans than before.

I don’t like that every character has a rich backstory that they are weaving into the main plot. Everything is too explicitly connected and the outcomes too conveniently line up with the storytelling goals. Jade is a Bone Reaver? Well that whole situation is a bit of a ribbon.

Anyway— it’s fantasy and pretty fun. It’s missing the heart and mystery of the original that made it work. I’m a watch it though."
Borderline,"Sorry. It's not in tone with the movie. Just because the movie had some comedy doesn't mean it was a slapstick, bad acting, poor writing, sitcom.

People were dirty and desperate. There was an attempt in the movie to still be in a fantasy medieval universe. 

No one expects LOTR or GOT. Willow is to those projects what Star Wars is to 2001. There's humor in Star Wars and Willow but it isn't goofy and wink at the camera shit."
Borderline,My turnoff is the modern day music covers in a fantasy show. Takes me out of it.
Borderline,"Its CW fantasy. Which is like ""YA"" but turned up a notch."
Borderline,The Willow NES game was good.
Borderline,"I vaguely liked Willow the movie, and its frustrating that the show sometimes seems to have a glimmer of the movie but then its gone. The show is both leaning too heavily on references to the movie, and yet also feels like a pointless sequel at the same exact time!

It doesn't have the light hearted playful feel of the movie, instead we have DUMB MCU quips style humour and Elora acting like an airhead.

The pop song covers feel totally out of place, Black Hole Sun? REALLY? Damn do an orchestral score.

I think what the show is missing most is the earnest feel the original had, there was not a hint of meta or irony in the movie."
Borderline,I was shocked at how bad Warwick Davis's acting was. I wonder what went wrong. I half expected a Gervais laugh and for the camera to pan around.
Borderline,"I made a previous comment in another thread that I will past below. I do want to address certain points.

&#x200B;

>I thought useful to remind (or warn) that Willow does not aim to compete with House of Dragons, Rings of Power or the Witcher.

I am not sure who was thinking this? The original movie was a campy adventure. The TV show (I am a few episodes behind) have not been campy. The episodes I have seen lack the heart and the magic of the original. The dialogue has been atrocious and much of the acting has simply not been that good. Warwick has been fine (even though I don't like the direction of his character so far, but he has acted the hell out of it).  It seems like everyone else is written with too modern vernacular and use words and phrases that don't fit in a fantasy universe. It also doesn't help that every actor has pristine clothes and make up/hair from the episodes I've seen.

&#x200B;

>Not in budget

I don't know the show's budget, but this is not a low budget show.

&#x200B;

>The show we got is an anachronistic pastiche of fantasy, where characters are frauds, borderline incompetent

Who in the original were frauds or borderline incompetent?

&#x200B;

* Willow wants to be a sorcerer, but has had no prior training. He clearly struggles to perform magic and relies on parlor tricks, but that's not being a fraud or incompetent, that's just where his character is in the movie.
* Madmartigan is legit an amazing swordsmen. Maybe not the greatest as he claims, but he is established as a reputable fighter. The fact that he is a rogue/scoundrel that makes poor decisions does not make him a fraud or incompetent. Willow knew it was a bad idea to leave Elora with him, but did so against his better judgment so he could get home.
* Fin Raziel and Bavmorda were both powerful sorceresses with Bavmorda just being more powerful.
* The Brownies were comic relief, but I wouldn't consider them frauds or incompetent.
* Kael, Sorsha, Airk, etc. all serve their roles relatively well too.

&#x200B;

Previous comment:

I am two episodes behind so my opinion might change depending on those episodes.  
  
I love Willow. I had the VHS (I didn't have many), and it was something that I watched a lot. I probably rewatch it about once a year too. In my mind, Willow was a grand epic fantasy. The special effects were not great and definitely dated, but General Kael had the coolest helmet, Airk's sword was badass, and Madmartigan was the greatest swordsmen who ever lived. It had everything (obviously I am exaggerating, and I agree its world building is lacking). That being said, I thought the acting was all solid to great (in the context of this kind of movie), and the dialogue worked.  
  
I like Willow the TV show, but I wanted to love it. I am just not there. The dialogue is really bad and the performances are stiff. Kit, Airk, and Elora are all particularly not well acted. Their dialogue relies on too many modern or colloquial phrases that take you out of the fantasy. Those performances feel like bad actors at a renaissance fair.  
  
I don't feel like the TV show has any of the camp of the original. What the TV show lacks is heart. Willow was an unlikely hero that left his family behind for a baby he just met. Madmartigan is a scoundrel of sorts, but you knew he meant well. I don't think any character has displayed any of this kind of heart so far."
Borderline,My only real issue with willow is the odd modern music choices. Otherwise I feel it’s been a better show than wheel of time and rings of power.
Borderline,I started watching the first episode but became disinterested in it about half way through. I'm going to wait until the first season is done and give it another go though. The movie was one of my favorites growing up.
Borderline,"My wife and I like it. As fantasy fans, it fills that hole between seasons of other shows and, in my opinion, is not as terrible as others pitch it to be. Like someone mentioned before, it's kinda like watching an actual D&D adventure where they are terrible and competent enough to avoid a TPK. *shrugs* Different strokes for different folks."
Borderline,"The show and characters are written badly. But the biggest issue I have is the strange use of modern music covers in it. It's completely out of tone with the movie and really even the show.

Hearing the musical tones of the original Willow movie in the trailer for the new show got me really excited, the movie music really ""made"" the adventure. But what they chose to do for the show, it's just awful."
Borderline,I watched the 1st episode and wtf is this? I loved the movie where's the charm? It felt like a CW show
Borderline,"It reminds me of the fun fantasy shows I watched as a kid, like Xena and Hercules (but younger). It’s a fun, silly show."
Borderline,Willow? Classic. Boorman? Great comedic relief. Elora Danan? Quickly becoming the star. Graydon? Annoying but mysterious. Jade? A badass. But holy shit I cringe every time Kit talks.
Borderline,"There's a different between silly but coherent and, every character is written poorly, the plot is written poorly and is a contrived mess, and the fight choreography is also trash. You're honestly doing a disservice to the fantasy genre as a whole if you just accept trash and run cover for it."
Borderline,"I loved the movie when it came out, I was a teenager at the time. But you know, sometimes I like leaving the past in the past. I'm passing on the series."
Borderline,Yeah all that. But it's still shit though.
Borderline,It seems like you're arguing against a straw man here. No one cares that it's intended to be silly. They care that it isn't very good even at that.
Borderline,"It is wild to me how many people I'm seeing complain it's somehow disrespectful of the movie *and* that it's not serious and deep enough. 

It sure sounds like a lot of people who've never actually watched the movie are complaining it ain't faithful to it, because boy have I news for you about the tone and style of the movie Willow."
Borderline,Nah Willow the movie was one of my favorite childhood movies and I don't need this series to exist. This is a case of ignorance being bliss.
Borderline,I loved the original movie.  I've seen it dozens of times.  Even named my cat Madmartigan.  The problem with Willow is awful writing and acting.  Especially Ellie Bamber.
Borderline,Warwick Davis is likely the worst actor that I have ever seen act.
Borderline,"I loved the movie and it was one of my favorites of all time.

As i didnt ever think any show or new movie will be made i was surprised.

I kept my expectations low so i dont get disappointed, and i liked the show. But i didnt love it as the movie. But im still glad it was made."
Borderline,"Except the TV show is not at all similar to the movie - that's the main problem. The movie is endearing, charming, the TV series is genzfied shite with modern music."
Borderline,"Nah, I was very hopeful going into this.  i can safely say this time the critics have it right.  The only good thing about this show was the music in the credits at the end of the first 4 episodes, I'd say more but I stopped watching it.  Its just not good.  Set design is very poor quality and the monsters would have been better off as muppets instead of plastic action figures on sticks.  This show spent alot of money on actors and musical scores but completely checked out in CGI."
Borderline,"> where characters are frauds, borderline incompetent, unable to live up to the expectations, and yet, against all odds, manage to pull through.

The writers are writing what they know. Terrible at their job yet somehow failed upwards to a high profile project."
Borderline,"It's because it is YA fantasy.
Movie came out in 1988, us fans of the original Willow are 35 y/o or more but Disney chose to do a show for teenagers.
I feel weird watching it. Teenagers drama, silly and stupid adults, lame villains, etc. 

Not really for me..."
Borderline,"I love the movie, and I also love this show."
Borderline,"I'd never seen the original movie, but attempted the show. I only made it about 5 minutes in. The beginning sword match on the cliff felt like watching Liam Neeson [climb a fence](https://youtu.be/gCKhktcbfQM). As the first ""action"" scene, it gave me no hope for future choreography.

 Then in the first 2 dialogs, one person is speaking in an English accent, and the other in an American accent, which threw me off and made it feel poorly acted. Not knowing the back story of whether or not that was movie accurate for some reason, made me nope out of the show. 

Maybe it wasn't for me, maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but Disney+ is extremly hit or miss on quality. Willow did not give me hit vibes."
Borderline,"Have you seen the original film?

It's everything you've just described."
Borderline,It doesn't succeed at all! The fantasy world they created it doesn't make sense and it seems they even didn't know how it is. The characters seem from another reality. They changed the movie ending and give a twist that doesn't work. I don't like anything about it.
Borderline,I made it 15 minutes into episode one. Not my speed.
Borderline,"Finally an understanding review of this show. It's intentionally using lingo from our time but set in a medieval style time period. I like how they blatantly mix American English and British English and have a little bit of a sitcom response to a lot of stuff. I think people that watch it need to rewatch willow and remember just how slapstick it really was at times...
  ""Not a woman?...not a woman!?"" 
""Gentlemen.        Meet Lug."" 

And ""I love you sorsha? I don't love that woman she tried to kill me."""
Borderline,"I'm so sick of modern fan based. Nothing is good enough for them. Even if Lord of the Rings trilogy came out today they would tear it apart for the dialog and failure to hold true to Tolkien in his entirety. Nostalgia for old movies has ruined fan bases ability to enjoy new chapters or attempts.

Willow the series is right in line with the original film and is as enjoyable. The one gripe I have is the lack of Val Kilmer cameo which I'm holding hope for on season two or end credits of the season finale."
Borderline,"Why do people just not watch it. So much other content in the digital world.. 

Watching it with my son and he is enjoying it. Maybe it’s not written/aimed at you. Maybe it’s not meant to be like that show you really like. 

I’ve had lots of shows I’ve enjoyed but they were cancelled and I’ve had shows I hated that have went on for years. 

Try it don’t like it move on. Can apply that to life and the world will rotate all the same."
Borderline,"I was the right age to see the original in theatres and LOVED IT. So I'm good with the series,Im just happy to be back and not even irked by some terrible plot decisions. And c'mon, where are the book readers? I was thrilled to find out there was a second book, and they slaughter all my favorite people? In the first chapter?! So yep, happy to have my silly TV show..."
Borderline,I keep thinking did they watch the 1st film?
Borderline,"It's entertaining. I can't take it seriously, but other than the random pop songs, I've enjoyed watching it."
Borderline,"I genuinely don't understand why Hollywood takes beloved franchises with an established fanbase, gives it to people who despise the franchise and fanbase, and then let them use the name as a marketing gimmick for their own original story that would have never been greenlit as an original piece..."
Borderline,"Willow is a fun and entertaining show.  It is the best fantasy I've seen since the LotR movies.  The only thing that comes close is Vox Machina.

It is not the grim and ponderous fantasy that so many other shows and movies produce."
Borderline,"Which part of the original movie was silly? The killing kids part? The constant attacks on innocent villages? The man who wears a skull as a mask?

Oh wait, that one scene of Val Killer in drag. The one where he nearly gets raped. Got it.

The new show doesn't even make sense as a sequel to the film. It's a fine CW show though."
Borderline,"Willow is hot garbage. It has nothing to do with not trying to be house of dragons. I love the film. Costumes are junk and it feels like they are trying to force it down gen z's throat.

You say willow is supposed to be silly and I agree. It loses that when the characters take them selves so seriously."
Borderline,"Honestly I like Willow more than House of the Dragon. Willow isn’t going to win any awards, but it’s classic fantasy and we’ve seen a lot of character progression so far. The more good fantasy on tv the better."
Borderline,"I'll admit to being a bit disappointed. I like the cast, I like the cinematography, and I can even accept the denim as just more world building, but they're all over the place with tone. The little rock song at the end of each episode is ok, but when they use one for a action scene during the show it cheapens the world a bit and the characters feel a little less grounded in their world. (which means I care less about them) I'm also really confused about the pacing. The first season is almost over and they're supposed to be on this super long quest that will take them all over their world but it seems like they are still in the forest surrounding their Kingdom 6 episodes in. Plus, this is the third or fourth time an episode has ended with someone being abducted."
Borderline,"The problem is how they're making a joke of the source material(in angsty unfunny ways) and hamhocking every boring modern teenage drama trope into every boring fantasy trope 

This is corporate willow."
Borderline,">But it you're going to watch it, I'd suggest to wait and binge it, or to watch it very casually with an open mind. Or you know, put it aside if it's not your thing. That's ok too.

Why can't we watch it and criticize its shortcomings and bad writing?

Art subjected to the public for scrutiny (and money) doesn't mean it shouldn't have its faults pointed out just because you don't like people saying it."
Borderline,"The hate for Willow seems obvious.   This version has POC and LBGTQ characters.   There's a group online that's always going to downvote that.  Pretty sad way to go through life.    


Personally I find it fun, light entertainment, and that's fine.   There's been a couple of really great callbacks, some interesting twists on the characters, and the action is solid."
Borderline,It's better than rings of power. And thats a lot more than I would have expected about a Willow show filled with angsty teens
Borderline,"People just have ridiculous standards for genre shows nowadays. I'm absolutely loving all the fantasy stuff coming out, Rings of Power, Wheel of Time, and Willow have all been good watches. Having watched House of the Dragon yet cause I got burnt out hard on Game of Thrones, books and TV series, and just want to read the last few books and be done with it. But I'll probably eventually check it out. 

If people held genre shows in the 90s to the same standards they hold modern shows to, they'd hate every single one. Not in terms of special effects or cinematography, standards for those in TV have obviously gone up, but more timeless things like acting and writing. Shows like DS9 and TNG and Babylon 5 were all very good, but they all had some bad episodes, they all had bland beginnings, they all had corny dialog and 2d/inconsistent characters sometimes. And the next tier down in quality, like Voyager and Stargate and Xena and Hercules? All that stuff was way more common.

People want every show to be a mix of a top budget blockbuster movie cinematography and effects and action sequences and the Sopranos level writing and that just isn't gonna happen that often. Generally things with a really big budget have to try for a lot of mainstream appeal so they're gonna seem pretty bland and not have such complex and interesting characters as something like the Wire or Breaking Bad. Creating characters like that and not having them fall flat is very hard, and the people with the talent to do it are usually more interested in creating their own original stuff, not adapting a fantasy novel from 30 years ago or making a sequel series to a film from 35 years ago.

It's astounding for me that people bitch about fantasy shows now, having grown up with Xena and Hercules being pretty much the only fantasy on TV. People bitching seem to rather there would be no fantasy shows rather than accept that not every show is gonna have literature-level writing and Academy Award level acting. You don't need those things to make an enjoyable show, and if your personal standards are that high you need to accept most shit is not going to be to your liking. And if you want magic and elves and monsters and chosen ones in your shows AND top level acting and writing, you are generally gonna be disappointed because most of the super talented writers are not big on reusing such worn tropes."
Borderline,"I dunno, I think it's neat xD"
Borderline,I thought willow was fun to watch but I'm pretty easy going 🤷🏼
Borderline,Is it meant to be dogshit?
Borderline,Willow is a movie that was ruined for many when they rewatched it at middle age. It's not fantastic but it is a fun romp for a child.
Borderline,But it's not silly. It's cynical. It's trite.
Borderline,"Yeah, I think the problem is that many people are like me and never saw the original ... so they just expect it to be like every other fantasy thing out these days. From RoP to TWoT to The Witcher ... we have a lot of shows trying (and mostly failing) to be big budget big deal serious shows. This is goofy and campy and not meant to be super serious ... I noticed this when they kept flashing back to the story of Willow and showing how silly the story was.

&#x200B;

I personally enjoy Willow for what it is, if only because I could watch Erin Kellyman play something as mindmelting as CoD on Twitch for 2.5hrs as long as she has a face cam. It's a fun lil show, not much else to say about it."
Borderline,I'm enjoying it. Not all fantasy has to be high brow and serious. This is fun.
Borderline,"I wish people would stop making excuses for trash.

If you like the trash, then have you're guilty pleasure.

Don't try to feed me shit and tell me it's chocolate"
Borderline,"Yeah, no. It’s pure trash. It’s like they dropped a group of teenagers from 2022 on set, dressed them up and just called it a day. They speak like someone from 2022, they behave like someone from 2022, the cringe pop music… And let’s not forget Kit. Her character is enough for anyone to drop watching the show."
Borderline,"I don't think people remember fantasy in the pre-Game of Thrones era.  Fantasy usually doesn't have that kind of wide range appeal. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are more the exception than the rule.

But with GoT being such a hit a lot of fantasy projects are being greenlit and, surprise, people are all comparing it to GoT and if it isn't at that level it's being considered garbage.

Personally I'm enjoying it. I enjoy lighthearted fantasy and I don't need shakespearean actors going on long monologues or speeches to get into it. Or nudity or gore or grimdark stuff. That's fun and all but it's just one type of fantasy.

The great thing about fantasy is it's fantasy. It doesn't have to try and be a period piece. It's on an alternate world. Willow wears denim. They say ""shit"". Whatever"
Borderline,Willow is great
Borderline,"I'm actually really enjoying the Willow series, and I think it's native ""campiness"" and anachronism is a huge part of that."
Borderline,"I had never seen the movie before but based on reviews I was seeing of the show, I thought it must be some really serious and epic fantasy story. I then watched the movie before starting the series and it was not at all what I was expecting. Definitely very silly, very corny, and has that weird '80s thing where the plot somehow moves forward and characters know what they're supposed to do even though there is little dialogue and what dialogue there is makes little sense. I think many folks are looking at the movie with rose colored glasses from their childhood. I actually like the show better than the movie, though I don't love the Kit character."
Borderline,It’s a kids bland fantasy show. Ruined the original vision of willows world. Now it’s just the hills with bow and arrows
Borderline,"I actually adore this show having not been born when the first came out and being around the same age as the current young cast! I feel like I may be one of the only ones who do enjoy it at this point though reading through tweets and comments. It very much gives me that same child like wonderment as Narnia did for me when I was a kid, but with some levelled up humour. It’s silly, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously. I can put it on and relax unlike GOT but I still get whisked away to another world. I watch a lot of very serious stuff and I’m not a huge comedy person but this just hits the spot! It’s also nice to see a girly person like Elora be featured because I can see myself in her! Just my 2 cents"
Borderline,"It’s literally the same tone as the film, I grew up watching Willow and while the show isn’t as good as Willow it still tries to capture that same goofy spirit it always had.

I introduced my girlfriend and her daughter to Willow last week and they watched the movie for the first time then went straight into the show and love it, it’s a silly goofy story with moments of intense terror and drama and always has been"
Borderline,"I have only watched two episodes, but my problem with it pretty much started at the beginning. I don’t like how they used the most cliched trope for Elora Danan by having to hide her as a kitchen maid and having her and the fukboi prince being “in love”. Like please. Plus making her a blonde was unnecessary too. She’s supposed to be the “savior” of the realm or whatever and they made her a love sick ninny. I’m not mad, just disappointed."
Borderline,"You can do cheap, you can do pastiche, you can do whatever, but you'll fail when you are an incompetent writer and underestimate the ability of your consumers to use at least the most basic of logic thinking."
Borderline,"It's a mockery of storytelling, acting, direction and production.

The Critical Drinker explains it thoroughly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLRHR2Nou8A"
Borderline,"I don't understand the negative impressions, either.   The characters make me care about them, the actors have some nice charisma and chemistry, and the energy and music work well.  Willow's incompetence really sells it for me, it feels refreshing and new.

The other three you mentioned all fail to get my attention.   HoD has RR's lack of a protagonist, RoP has not a single character I wouldn't mind seeing killed (go Orcs!), and Witcher doesn't even try to be consistent or sensical.

But I watch Willow asap, and have ended each episode with energy each time.  The song Crimson and Clover had me singing along."
Borderline,[deleted]
Borderline,"I love it.

Except the music. The absolute modernity of the music is just weirdly clashing for me. Everything else though, I'm loving it."
Borderline,"I've indirectly rewatched the movie and the new show through YT reactions with ""Heroes Reforged"" and the show definitely seems fun.

I have been finding a lot of the jokes surprisingly funny but it's probably because I like sarcasm / dry humor, like they aren't quite MCU-level quips which can get annoying when done so much.

It definitely doesn't take itself too seriously which is a good thing. I'm obviously not sitting through entire episodes at length and only getting bits and pieces but what I have seen seems enjoyable."
Borderline,I thoroughly enjoyed the series.
Borderline,"The movie sucked. I remember being so horribly disappointed by it. That disappointment faded quickly, though, as I could easily forget about the movie. 

I was quite surprised to read about Willow reappearing. Also annoyed at being reminded of its existence. Won't be punishing myself by watching it."
Borderline,"Downvoted for “anachronistic pastiche”. We get it dude, you read"
Borderline,You Highness doesn’t aim to compete with those shows either but it works as a fantasy movie and doesn’t have the same critiques as this show.
Borderline,"There are people who like soft fantasy too. Me, for one."
Borderline,I just want a good HBO adaptation of The First Law series is that so much to ask? God damn it.
Borderline,"> where characters are frauds, borderline incompetent, unable to live up to the expectations, and yet, against all odds, manage to pull through. 

Is that an uncommon thing in fantasy? Because I feel like there are a lot of good stories with that sort of plot. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Amigos, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life, etc."
Borderline,"What’s hilarious to me is when they realized they messed up by keeping Elora’s hair color blonde, and had to make it “magically” turn red in the most recent episodes. Who’s running this show and why? 😂😂"
Borderline,"i love the show SO MUCH. i’ve been waiting for this type of fantasy genre to return since my childhood days and i couldn’t be happier to finally get a diverse cast, actually funny dialogue (most of the time lol), and less actiony fantasy. not every fantasy story needs intense stressful action scenes for the majority of the plot to be good (i personally can’t stand those types). if you like goofy and magical fantasy stories, you’ll love Willow."
Borderline,"I just finished the season finale, and I will say, I really loved this series.  It wasn't fully in the same sense as the original movie was, but it hit enough points of it that it hit my nostalgia.  It put a lot of odd modern day social sayings it it, which threw me off, but in the end I became very invested in watching it.  The way they ended each episode also was weird, but enjoyable.  My only gripe so far is that the cinematographers have no idea how to do low light scenes.  


I want to say more, but I'm trying to avoid any form of a spoiler."
Borderline,"> a bunch of chucklefucks blundering their way through a D&D campaign

So basically a DnD campaign."
Borderline,Please let the DnD movie be good...
Borderline,Yeah exactly. The show’s just a fun time.
Borderline,"I’ve enjoyed Willow. I like how they’ve interwoven the movie and show. I thought episode 3 & 4 were pretty good. 

Is it Shakespeare? No."
Borderline,"Exactly this. The prodigy couldn't do magic for two whole episodes. Boreman has snaked his way out of so much bullshit, he can't keep it straight anymore. Pure D & D shenanigans."
Borderline,This is also basically the plot of The Legend of Vox Machina.
Borderline,"Legend of the Seeker did this, only LOS was fucking outrageously good. Better than it should have bee,"
Borderline,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSynJyq2RRo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSynJyq2RRo)  Chucklefucks playing Dnd
Borderline,This is the best way to describe the show haha
Borderline,It really was.  Each character felt like someone playing around a table.  I think that's another thing that kept me invested.
Borderline,"This - all the characters are unlikable - Disney has once again taken an old hero , made him tired and broken and lost their light in order to prop up new characters .  I honestly though they learned their lesson with SW that you don't need to shit on the past to make a new promising future. 

All the new characters are really unlikable except maybe the curly haired girl and the criminal Axe guy .

The subura forester lesbians were probably the best characters so far even if they were COMPLETELY out of place like random time travels in the woods .   I knew they were dead the second i was like O hey they are interesting ."
Sonic Boom,this sounds fucking hilarious. what is a sonic boom?
Sonic Boom,[deleted]
Sonic Boom,...is Guile involved?
Sonic Boom,"Honestly, this sounds like a satire episode making fun of the outrage mob that you find on sites like Twitter. From what you describe, it comes off as Sonic saying something truthful, but it hurts someone's feelings so Sonic gets ""Cancelled"".

Maybe someone on the writing staff was trying to make a subtle statement of how stupid it really is."
Sonic Boom,"lol watched half of it, plot was fine, offend by the cheap animation"
Sonic Boom,"damn, that is indeed shockingly dumb"
Sonic Boom,"> sonic boom

A comedic Sonic series based on the Sonic Boom games. It's surprisingly funny."
Sonic Boom,Was thinking it sounded like a robot chicken bit
Sonic Boom,"It is, especially since the mob says ""no we were wrong Sonic, you are better than us""."
Sonic Boom,I couldn't find it on youtube.Could you please send me the link?
Sonic Boom,[Here’s the first episode](https://youtu.be/4gGj98WYYSo). The rest can be found on the same channel.
Sonic Boom,"Thnx.

Only season 1 is available on Youtube right or is S2 region blocked for me?"
Sonic Boom,Season 2 isn’t numbered for some odd reason. You’ll often find that you have to Google which episode comes next.
Sonic Boom,"This is so weird

Not the statement, but the statement coming out of a red echidna."
Sonic Boom,Chris chan did it better.
Sonic Boom,"The Sonic Boom games are horrid. 

The TV show is brilliant. It's self aware and takes the piss out of the Sonic franchise and life in general often "
Sonic Boom,"My favourite line was along the lines of

Sonic 'I'll do it, my middle name is [something]'

Knuckes 'I thought it was The'"
Sonic Boom,"This show is a clear example of a production studio getting the deal to make a sonic kids show and have little oversight and they just go ""eh fuck it let's just have fun with it"" and then as luck would have it the creators are talented and fun people and not the worst."
Sonic Boom,Holy shit he's right
Sonic Boom,I can't tell if this was agreeing with feminists or making fun of them.
Sonic Boom,"I can't watch the video, can someone give a transcription or a TL;DW?"
Sonic Boom,I have never seen this show. But between this and the chris chan episode i feel like it has the right stuff
Sonic Boom,Hey look it's my video!
Sonic Boom,I don't understand how Amy or any of them play soccer against Sonic. Dude is too fucking fast. He'd have to be sandbagging pretty fucking hard to make the game fun at all.
Sonic Boom,That... That is not the knuckles I remember...
Sonic Boom,"Knock knock its Knuckles, unlike Sonic he never chuckles, he just flexes his gender equality knowledge. "
Sonic Boom,"Oh, hey, this Sonic show looks pretty good. They should make a game out of- oh...

Never mind."
Sonic Boom,"I remember complaining about sonic boom but after getting some of the references in the TV show liking it. Sure, story is never great but when they add in something for the veteran fans it really makes it hilarious because it's always satirical."
Sonic Boom,Lmao the reactions are the best part.
Sonic Boom,It is weird hearing Travis Willingham as Knuckles. 
Sonic Boom,Anybody else bothered that sonic still has the one eye socket thing while everybody else has two separate eyes?
Sonic Boom,Will never get on board with jacked knuckles
Sonic Boom,So what else do they talk about on this show?
Sonic Boom,Came in expecting Guile. Leaving because no Guile or Guile theme song.
Sonic Boom,"Didn't even know this show was a thing. 

Also loving how people get angry about this being ""feminist talk"" in a kids show, even while the joke takes the piss out of the parts of the movement that probably annoys them the most. "
Sonic Boom,Awww yiss...
Sonic Boom,SAVAGE! And true!
Sonic Boom,Eeeesh.
Sonic Boom,Women are almost always worse athletes than men and that's fine.
Sonic Boom,I don't want to live on this planet anymore
Sonic Boom,Do we rly needs those topics in child cartoons?
Sonic Boom,[deleted]
Sonic Boom,When did facts take a back seat to politics?
Sonic Boom,Fucking disgraceful. Stop trying to brainwash the youth of America. This is sickening. 
Sonic Boom,If your feeling suicidal you've came to the right place.
Sonic Boom,Yeah that red enchilada is neat 
Sonic Boom,Especially coming from an echidna? Perhaps because his lineage can be traced to amongst the first known mammals you would expect his views to be more conservative.
Sonic Boom,That's racist.
Sonic Boom,....are other animals more suited to tackle gender roles in society?
Sonic Boom,"Is he even an echidna any more? I mean he was always a weird looking one anyway, but the proportions of these characters have gone off the rails over the years."
Sonic Boom,"If anything he makes a very valid and interesting point, like this is strangely poignant considering that this is a Sonic TV show. "
Sonic Boom,"> Chris chan

He's got a character in Sonic Boom as well, [Season 2 Episode 5 The Biggest Fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQWRCcvlxBM)"
Sonic Boom,"Damn, what the internet did to that guy was fucked up. I know he was mentally ill even before the harassment but just the level of bullying this guy went through was truly legendary and sad."
Sonic Boom,"Okay, is it one of those shows you watch but never tell anyone you ever watched it?"
Sonic Boom,I love how they actually did the Knuckles infinite jump glitch in the show 
Sonic Boom,"""Hero is just another word for sandwich"" -Knuckles"
Sonic Boom,Can't be a very good show if that's the best line you can think of.
Sonic Boom,"no he's not. acknowledging that there is such a thing as gender (/race) is not sexist/racist. Saying Jackie Robinson broke a barrier isn't racist, the barrier was. "
Sonic Boom,"Eh, its not that simple. He's isn't making fun of feminists so much as he's calling out those who pride themselves on being feminists (usually as a selling point) simply for filling a generally male-dominate role with a female.

Ex: Girlboss"
Sonic Boom,"Making fun of feminists, and agreeing with feminism."
Sonic Boom,Stop looking at things so simply
Sonic Boom,"Well it's agreeing with the concept of equality and true feminism, but it kind of calls out the Tumblr feminists."
Sonic Boom,"someone calls something grey


> so did they call it black or white?

are you stupid?"
Sonic Boom,"He is agreeing with a subset of feminists while mocking another subset of feminists. Seriously, is that difficult to comprehend? That a group of people can be easily broken down into more categories? It's not like they are all the same. It's weird whenever someone goes ""wow, a feminist that makes sense"". It gives people this impression that you're pretty narrow-minded by not being capable of understanding that groups are made up of individuals that are different. Calling all feminists evil is like calling all Americans fat rednecks. Does that sound fair or rational to you? When someone criticize a subset of Americans, do you immediately get butthurt and scream as if you're the one being targeted? Most people don't because they understand that others aren't targeting Americans in general but a subset of Americans instead. Understand this."
Sonic Boom,"Both. True feminism is just about seeking equality between genders, whereas all the other bullshit is either trying to divide, or conquer."
Sonic Boom,"Amy: It all comes down to this one penalty kick. Can the young woman break the glass ceiling, and prove once and for all, that a female can be just as good as an athlete as a male?!

Knuckles: Y'know Amy, anytime someone calls attention to the breaking of gender roles, it ultimately undermines the concept of gender equality by implying that **this** is an exception, and not the status quo.

*everyone gives Knuckles a surprised look*

Knuckles: What? Just because I'm a meathead, doesn't mean I'm not a feminist."
Sonic Boom,"A girl is trying to score a soccer goal and she basically says ""Im gonna be as good as a a man"" and then this guy whos kinda a dumbass in general says this long speech about how mentioning that is actually pushing back the feminist movement. He ends with ""I may be a meathead, but im still a feminist!"""
Sonic Boom,Amy is making the 'prove girls can be just as good as boys' speach. Knuckles calls her out with a well articulated counter point on the true nature of feminism and the glass ceiling. Stunning everone.
Sonic Boom,"You should definitely check out some of the episodes. The episodes ""Just a Guy"" and ""Role Models"" are basically social satires of what happens when people try to be too politically correct. ""Aim Low"" is another good one, Eggman basically comes down with depression (which become a sort of recurring thing) and hires a therapist, but the therapist mostly wants to sell him shit he doesn't need instead of fixing the problem, which is the first of many gags expense of the healthcare system."
Sonic Boom,"Thanks mate, cool video!"
Sonic Boom,[deleted]
Sonic Boom,Do you want the karma or something you should of reposted it it's too late now 
Sonic Boom,If you watched the show you'd know that Sonic is pretty stoned most of the time.
Sonic Boom,"He has a really good top speed but his acceleration isn't instantaneous looking back at the games.  Also based on the games (which is based on the player, which is based on me), his reaction is also pretty shit. "

Sonic Boom,Amy has the same thing as Sonic
Sonic Boom,Amy still has the one socket thing. Maybe it's a hedgehog thing.
Sonic Boom,"[In a recent interview, the head of Sonic Team confirmed Sonic does have two separate eyeballs, they just look like one](http://www.gameinformer.com/themes/blogs/generic/post.aspx?WeblogApp=features&y=2017&m=06&d=10&WeblogPostName=more-burning-questions-about-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-franchise-answered&GroupKeys=)"
Sonic Boom,The design has a lot more personality imo
Sonic Boom,Runin' around at the speed of sound
Sonic Boom,"The importance of teamwork, the best way to get a girl is to be yourself, teen pop stars are secretly hypnotizing girls with their singing... Normal stuff"
Sonic Boom,In the 3rd episode they had a pretty in depth abortion debate.
Sonic Boom,"A surprising amount. They have a couple episodes making fun of being too PC, a series of recurring gags at the expense of the healthcare system, an entire episode ripping the failings of mainstream journalism, and general government bureaucracy. [Even the Sonic games themselves aren't safe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9tkmos5CN4) from the scathing satire of Sonic Boom. You wouldn't expect a Sonic cartoon to rail against the ills of modern society, but it's truly the commentary of our times."
Sonic Boom,"Not really, it's what most feminists agree with. "
Sonic Boom,"I mean, we separate women's and men's leagues for a reason"
Sonic Boom,It's amazing that you are getting downvoted for fact...
Sonic Boom,I think the main point to focus on is that we all equal. Just because a man in a wheelchair isn't strong don't make him less valid. just like gender.
Sonic Boom,Why? What's wrong with the video?
Sonic Boom,"They kind of always have been topics. Telling girls and boys to believe in themselves and break stereotypes. I think it's pretty cool that a show takes the time to explain, how there's a difference between breaking stereotypes and shouting that you are breaking them.

I just never expected it to come from this show, that I just learned existed."
Sonic Boom,"I mean, ""gender equality should happen"" is a topic we can all agree with, surely."
Sonic Boom,God forbid children question society 
Sonic Boom,If we don't it produces adults like you. So I'm gonna go with: Yes.
Sonic Boom,"If you don't agree with feminism, just latch on to the fact that it's the team meathead saying it.

There, now everybody's happy, right?"
Sonic Boom,what are the facts
Sonic Boom,Are you really saying it isn't factual that we should try and bridge the gap between the sexes?
Sonic Boom,You must be a troll if you think teaching kids about gender equality is brainwashing.
Sonic Boom,[deleted]
Sonic Boom,"KEK.

Looks like you're the only one that thinks so.

KEK."
Sonic Boom,no mames guey.
Van Helsing,I read this entire thing thinking about Wynonna Earp.
Van Helsing,"I stopped in Season 2,i love vampires but that show was not good."
Van Helsing,I tried to watch this show and it was just so terrible.
Van Helsing,"Blood Drive and Happy canceled

Van Helsing got 5 seasons."
Van Helsing,[removed]
Van Helsing,I like the show but I don't love it.  I have seen up til the current season and have it available to watch but haven't felt like it.  Its not a great story but I like most of the actors and thats pretty much why I keep watching.
Van Helsing,it felt like a CW show
Van Helsing,">  Like sociopaths that are written correctly don't make it boring even if they do show no emotion. 

Sociopaths certainly show emotion; experienced and *self-trained* to react.  There's just something different about them from psychopaths; they're like genetic internet trolls.  Psychopaths don't experience  emotions, and are detached from reality or grasp of societal expectations.

> So, with a show with this big of a problem, why can't I stop watching it?

Because you're a fool, or possibly suffer from some form of OCD.  The way to look at it, there's too much good shows to spend time watching VH.  Just pickup a show you haven't watched or an old great show.  I find it helps if you either stop at the end of a season (even with cliffhanger), or at a point where you can say a ""new"" story starts."
Van Helsing,"I tried to like this show but it was just too damn depressing. All the characters turn unlikable at some point. No comedy, super depressing, no good moments ever. No hope. All the characters are unlikable. I actually ended up hating it.

How the hell did it get a 4th season?? One of the worst shows I've seen"
Van Helsing,I love Van Helsing! Yeah it's depressing but that's what life would be like in that situation.
Van Helsing,I'm on season 4. And I'm just so damn over the fact that they ceep making the same damn mistake over and over again. Shoot them in the head. Blow their damn head of. But no. They just keep shooting them in the chest.
Van Helsing,This show gave me cancer !
Van Helsing,"The first season was not great as everybody was basically just being mean to each other for no reason, it found its footing in season 2 partly of Christopher Heyerdahl, but the writing also got much better and I felt Dylan's fate."
Van Helsing,"I kinda feel they are hitting the same spot of bad in some ways but good in other ways and just very entertaining.

I really think the show should have ended in the previous season (obviously, with a different finale, I don't mean it to end open-ended like that). 

The last  season was particularly uneven, and I have the impression also somewhat held back extra by Corona measures. Tricia Helfer needed more people to interact with as Dark One (or even as Olivia or what the character's original self was called), and the other characters kept being split up for the same reason probably."
Van Helsing,They're both pretty bad.
Van Helsing,I actually prefer Van Helsing to Wynonna Earp even though Wynonna is generally high rated by people.
Van Helsing,"Lol, I watched both of them all the way through. They are pretty much on the same level."
Van Helsing,it did get better in the second season if thats of any use
Van Helsing,Man Happy was great.
Van Helsing,Don't forget Deadly Class!
Van Helsing,Happy! died for this?
Van Helsing,"> It is by far the worst show Syfy has ever made. 

That's a damned low bar to limbo under."
Van Helsing,"It’s not time wasting if you’re having fun watching it. Cringing at bad TV for the sake of cringing can be fun. 

Not every TV show we watch has to be super serious and requires our full undivided attention."
Van Helsing,Chill daddy
Van Helsing,"Grandfather on his death bed:

""My only regret is watching a Syfy show for a few seasons, 60 years ago. I only hope it doesn't reflect too badly upon me at Heaven's gates."""
Van Helsing,Bruh it's just a show. Chill. I only watch it when I have cleared my schedule and don't feel lime doing anything.
Van Helsing,how did they go from shows like Eureka and The Magicians to this???
Van Helsing,Apologies for the poor psychology knowledge. The conclusion is the writing on the main character was dog-shit.
Van Helsing,">Because you're a fool

i literally explained why i keep watching dumbass. can you not read? there was no need for this comment."
Van Helsing,I preferred Killjoys...
Van Helsing,"The second and third seasons are actually good. Season #1 is mostly a ""bottle show"", which hurts it. The last two seasons are really hurt by the absence of Overton."
Van Helsing,I preferred Dark Matter...yes I'm still bitter
Van Helsing,Watching season 4 and it's mostly pretty boring due to the absence of vanessa. You are absolutely correct.
Van Helsing,"> To watch the GenZeroes series viewers will need to purchase an NFT via the House of Kibaa website.


In the words of Logan Roy, ""Fuck Off"""
Van Helsing,Ill just screenshot the series.
Van Helsing,"You're using the word ""star"" here in a new and innovative way."
Van Helsing,I like him as an actor but whooo boy anything with the word NFT in it immediately makes me roll my eyes so far back it hurts
Van Helsing,"The one-eyed dog was more of a star in ‘Hawkeye’ than his quaternary character. 

Also NFTs are a scam."
Van Helsing,"> To watch the GenZeroes series viewers will need to purchase an NFT via the House of Kibaa website. The “GenZeroes Universe” includes a live-action series, comics, and collectibles. Each level of NFT ownership will endow different benefits with the top level allowing fractional ownership of the series.

> Producers tell us that negotiations are under way for the series to go to a wider platform for mainstream viewing after it has completed its run as an NFT release on the House of Kibaa website."
Van Helsing,"Crazy, it's   like when DVDs first started to slowly appeared and people were like WTF is this ?"
Van Helsing,">Producers tell us that negotiations are under way for the series to go to a wider platform for mainstream viewing after it has completed its run as an NFT release on the House of Kibaa website.

Soooo, nobody buy into the NFT crap and just wait for it to be released mainstream."
Van Helsing,"Lol this is gonna get pirated hard, and NFT Bros are gonna be mad"
Van Helsing,It has more in common with that girl that was selling farts in jars than it does with the invention of DVD’s!
Van Helsing,"Don't think people were that mystified by DVDs when they first appeared in the market, after all a DVD was the next evolutionary step after VHS & LaserDisc."
Van Helsing,It's more like when Enron started and some morons were like WOW this seems like a great investment.
Van Helsing,"No it’s more like when McDonald’s made a cartoon but you had to buy some McNuggets or other gross food in order to get it, or when Burger King made video games that came with a combo and people were like WTF is this?"
Van Helsing,Yep.
Van Helsing,"But I'm just downloading a copy, they still have their own unique original so the worth is unaffected."
Van Helsing,"It was more like ""Why can't I record stuff and why can't half the players read the disc I paid for? Fuck this crap!"""
Van Helsing,I only watched the first season before I couldn’t stomach it anymore. How is this even still on the air at all?
Van Helsing,I don't believe Syfy's claims that this will run in the Fall - I bet airing of the final season gets pushed back to Jan. 2021.
Van Helsing,Any idea if Kelly Overton will be the lead again?
Van Helsing,"i very much liked season 1 and some of season 2 & 3 but it got annoying that THE LEAD CHARACTER ON THE SHOW WAS NOT ON THE SHOW!!  lol. 

the show's lead Kelly Overton (due to being pregnant once during season 2 and then again during season 4?) was not in (iirc) much of seasons 2 & 4. the show is NOT that great without Kelly Overton. she's great and she makes the show a fun time!
they did bring in Missy Peregrym in season 2 (in an important key role) and her character was an awesome badass (like Vanessa is). 
having Missy fill in (sort of) for Kelly's absence did help but then at the end of season 3 Missy left the show.  

i hope Overton's children are happy and healthy but her big absences on this show where she's the LEAD CHARACTER definitely hurt the show and it annoyed many us fans. the new younger characters they moved into the lead roles (basically taking over the Vanessa role) just can't hold a candle to Overton's screen presence."
Van Helsing,"I got a little farther but yea, how is it still on"
Van Helsing,That channel has zero other shows.
Van Helsing,It’s very cheap.
Van Helsing,Cuz you seem to be on the minority
Van Helsing,"I could see them sandwiching it between the halved Wynonna Earp season 4, with Resident Alien premiering sometime between as well to keep the network's lights on. 

Damn - Syfy has got very little left."
Van Helsing,"Overton was on her second maternity leave in season #4 (her first was in season #2(?)), so yes I think she should be back more in season #5."
Van Helsing,"My first thought as well. Never seen a lead actress disappear like that so many times!

Happy to have crossbow wielding Nicole Munoz picking up the slack."
Van Helsing,i very much liked season 1 and some of season 2. the show is NOT that great without Kelly Overton. she's great and she makes the show a fun time!
Van Helsing,Because it got better after season #1.
Van Helsing,And they even cancelled Channel Zero!
Van Helsing,I watched until the last season. It certainly does not get better. It started much better.
Van Helsing,ran stargate into oblivion
Van Helsing,[deleted]
Van Helsing,TIL there is a Van Helsing show on Syfy.
Van Helsing,Imagine canceling The Expanse and renewing Van Helsing
Van Helsing,"i have been a big fan of this show since it first started but VANESSA IS BARELY IN THE SHOW ANY MORE!!! i noticed her absence in the show for the past 2 seasons and that (like TWD?) 1 or 2 episodes will focus on 1 or 2 characters only. this current season Vanessa (the main reason why i watch this show) has only been in maybe 3 episodes. i notice the actress is one of the producers so i assume her being in the show less and less is her decision (which is why they are focusing on these 2 new characters. i won't spoil who they are and who they are related to).

i guess Kelly Overton (Vanessa) wants to go do other projects but it's really annoying/disappointing when a show that is based on/around her character barely has her in it anymore. tbh, i don't know if i will even bother to finish out this current season or watch this next/last season."
Van Helsing,I really thought they were heading towards a series finale for this season.
Van Helsing,Holy shit I thought this was canceled in the first season.
Van Helsing,But you cancel Dark Matter? Ok
Van Helsing,I like this show. It's mindlessly entertaining and harmless. Glad it's getting a chance to wrap thre story.
Van Helsing,"lol, if you want girl power monster hunting, watch Wynonna Earp. It's a much better show."
Van Helsing,"Fuck you SyFy.

Just shut down already"
Van Helsing,Forced myself through the first season but the second season I dropped it real fast. The lead actress was pretty damn bland and bad to me. If they made the entire show about Scarlet I probably would’ve stuck around.
Van Helsing,3rd and 4th season have been utter aids
Van Helsing,The 5 season curse of Syfy continues
Van Helsing,"Enjoying the new cast this season, would agree it’s probably time to wrap it up. Tough to show the scale on a SyFy budget. Wish some of the bigger casualties had stuck around."
Van Helsing,"Two or three weeks ago they had the best episode in the whole run. Other than that, meh."
Van Helsing,[deleted]
Van Helsing,"It's cheaper. SyFy was making no money off of the expanse, called the expense by production crew, it's a miracle they gave it 3 seasons."
Van Helsing,"And Happy, and my personal favorite Deadly Class..."
Van Helsing,"Actually happy about this now it’s in Amazon’s hands, but yeah, fuck SyFy."
Van Helsing,When one is so much more expensive is it any surprise? Van Helsing probably makes more money on a fifth of the ratings.
Van Helsing,imagine running a network and only caring about ratings (ie ad $$$)
Van Helsing,"I honestly couldnt even make it through one episode, it was just so bad, and this shit got renewed over fucking Deadly Class. Ive never been so pissed before.


Edit: not the expanse, im talking about van helsing being shit."
Van Helsing,"It is weird! I’m not sure why the lead actress fully takes off so many episodes, to the point where guest stars are seemingly the new leads. Ok glad someone else noticed"
Van Helsing,Pretty sure its because she was pregnant so they didn't shoot as much for her this season and some of last.
Van Helsing,"you might like the show these days since Vanessa is barely in it.  she's been in maybe 3 episodes this entire season.
personally, i love Vanessa but Scarlet was awesome too!"
Van Helsing,5 seasons for pretty much any show (a drama or a horror show or...etc.) is more than adequate/reasonable.   too many shows insist on going on for a million seasons and most of those shows overstay their welcomes imo.
Van Helsing,it's not about a van helsing related character (maybe a descendant or something) having something to do with vampires ?
Van Helsing,"I'm well aware. Perhaps they should have worked out a better plan prior to release, because their reasons don't change the fact that they cancelled the best Sci-Fi show of the decade and continue to renew garbage shows."
Van Helsing,Isn’t that the point of a commercial network? Any “art” that is created is just tangental to making money.
Van Helsing,"No, Scifi before USA bought them and turned them into SYFY(aka ghost wrestling) managed to make money and produce nearly 20 combined seasons of Stargate. not to mention the other quality scifi shows they've made. 

&#x200B;

This new bastard SYFY is a water the beer down bleed them dry cash grab. Which is different from a cable channel seeking loyal viewers and producing quality product."
Van Helsing,"Horseteak, i didn't realize Kelly Overton was pregnant. Congrats to her! :)
the thing is though that she has been appearing in less and less episodes for at least 2 seasons now."
Van Helsing,"You're absolutely right, a properly planned adaptation of The Expanse by the Sy-Fy Channel would have been to never make The Expanse in the first place.

But they did, and it was a bad investment. The fact that it was also a great show is not relevant to them. They gave it a reasonable go."
Van Helsing,"I think that was the joke. At least, I hope it was."
Van Helsing,"USA Networks (run by Paramount and Universal) ran Sci-Fi from the time it launched in 1992. It got shuffled around a bit but it's generally always been a Universal project. 

They first started airing non-scifi stuff in 2006 and they didn't rebrand until 2009."
Van Helsing,You can never tell on reddit.
The OA,My favorite theory was that the show cancellation was part of the 'ruse' and we would actually get another season.
The OA,"So amazing. The cancellation, despite the cliffhanger, ended the show on an ironically fitting note."
The OA,"When I saw Nope I was like hey, that’s Frenchie!"
The OA,I love this show and this is probably the show I am the saddest didn't get to make more. The show wore it's heart on its sleeve and loved it form beginning to end. If anyone likes this I would recommend giving Sense8 a shot
The OA,Straight masterpiece.
The OA,"You know, maybe it isn't a bad idea to do another rewatch... To get caught in Brit and Batmanglij tale again, be mesmerized once more. It might have been long enough."
The OA,Can confirmed it is a really good show.
The OA,"The first season was a bunch of meandering dull shit with the dumbest ending ever filmed. 

I never bothered with the second season."
The OA,"I remember cringing watching their aerobics session in the school (ending of S1 I think?) but the concept of the show is pretty cool and the next season is quite fun.


 Brit Marling has done some nice sci fi stuff and it's quite a shame she does next to nothing now..."
The OA,I liked season 1 more than 2. Felt more focussed and absorbing. But season 2 was essential in introducing more concepts and laying out the groundwork for the next seasons. Shame we didn’t get it.
The OA,"I thought the first season was great and I liked all the corny elements in it.

Second season I thought was considerably less interesting, especially turning the whole thing into ""alternate worlds"" which has been done way too many times. Though I did like the episodes with the kids."
The OA,I liked both seasons though they were both different. I do wish we had gotten another season because of the way it ended. Shame.
The OA,"The OA makes me feel like no other television show. 

I still haven’t decided if it’s one of the best TV shows ever or one of the worst."
The OA,I had watched this show immediately after Stranger Things. I absolutely loved it. I am looking forward to rewatching The OA soon!
The OA,"I loved it, but I'm really sad they canceled it at a cliffhanger."
The OA,"The funny thing is that I specifically remember it being shit on and disliked on Reddit while season 1 was out. People thought that the hand movements were cheesy.

Once it got cancelled though the show became really beloved. It's still one of my favorite shows of the past decade."
The OA,The cancelation of this show is what made me hate Netflix.
The OA,[deleted]
The OA,I loved this show but I haven't rewatched it because the season 2 finale will piss me off even more now.
The OA,"Everything about it? 

I seem to have a vivid memory of a telepathic genocidal octopus"
The OA,"I thought season 2 was awful... Like nigh unwatchable.

Season 1 was alright though.  At least entertaining."
The OA,[deleted]
The OA,Happy birthday!
The OA,Same. It really bad. It's crazy to me to see people heaping praise on it.
The OA,[deleted]
The OA,"Another Earth, Sound of My Voice, and I Origins were among my favorite movies of the last ten years. She's phenomenally talented."
The OA,"Then in season 2, you get [robots doing the moves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO6Sseqd-_Y) and this completely changes their context..."
The OA,Is a shame. Bad destination but a fun journey.
The OA,I thought they were too.  But the show is still good.
The OA,"I think the people that shit on it probably mostly moved on, and the people that still talk about are the ones that loved it. 

I can get why it breaks stuff for some people. But I decided to go all in, cut my disbelief suspenders off and jump all in and never regretted it.

Well, maybe except the time when I learned it was cancelled. That sucked. But... It's better to have a cancelled OA than never have experienced the OA, or something like that."
The OA,I think the cliffhanger works especially because it is so satisfying to see the reveal.
The OA,And it was amazing
The OA,">!They bring the show into the ""real world""!<"
The OA,I hope it has a slight element of sci fi or fantasy like their other stuff
The OA,"Another Earth is something I can't even properly describe to people, it's so mesmerizing"
The OA,That dancing is still hilarious.
The OA,That's certainly one word for it
The OA,"100%. It's one of my favorite movies ever. Top 10. 

As a writer and actor, she taps into interesting stuff - emotionally, psychologically, and existentially. She's not super prolific, but that's okay. I'll always look forward to Brit Marling's projects."
The OA,"Yea this is seriously underrated.

I honestly seem to forget it myself even from time to time. Then someone brings it up.

Been a very long time since I've seen it. And only saw it once. Need to track it down."
The OA,You talking about the S1 finale?
The OA,Yes but also in general
The OA,It's more cringe than funny to me lol. But I love the characters so I dont mind it!
The OA,Yes very cringey
The OA,S1 was compelling. S2 was way better and way deeper. Netflix is absolutely crazy for cancelling this show
The OA,"The day I heard they cancelled The OA, I cancelled my Netflix sub and haven't been back since. One of the biggest mistakes they've ever made.

&#x200B;

She had five seasons planned and we could have had something amazing. The second season cliffhanger was one of the most brutal I've ever seen. I NEED to know what happened next."
The OA,"I kinda liked most of S1, but I never got around to S2.

I thought the concept was great; good cast; the weird interpretive dancing was, well, weird, but I was willing to roll with it; but the S1 finale was such a flop that I just lost all interest.

Anyone else who hated the S1 finale; worth continuing?"
The OA,I loved the show.
The OA,Isn’t this the show where they ended a school shooting by doing an interpretive dance?
The OA,There had never been a show I was more bitter about being cancelled. I was so totally engrossed by the mystery and story telling. I remember watching the last 10ish minutes of season 2 with my jaw hanging open because I couldn't believe a show had the balls to go that route. And I was so excited to see what happened next. ☹️
The OA,"Just disgusting for canceling OA, 1899 and keeping Emily in Paris. Ffs."
The OA,"It was such an original show, nothing like I had ever seen before. Wish it got an ending."
The OA,"I’ve never had a show creep back into my thoughts unbidden like The OA does. I was thinking about it yesterday and I watched it years ago.

Such powerful moments, I thought the S1 finale dance was such a powerful culmination and the exit afterwards lead into a S2 that I just never expected.
The story constantly went in ways I could not predict, but all felt organic in how they developed (nightclub cephalopod aside).
The season 2 ending just flipped my noodle completely. Elegant, powerful, setting up such powerful options for the future. I think only Twin Peaks: The Return I’ve watched with such intensity"
The OA,I'm gonna watch this again.
The OA,This show was fantastic
The OA,The OA was spectacular. Shouldve got to finish. I hate netflix for cancelling amazing shows
The OA,The show was so impressive in so many ways. I was gripped and enthralled the entire time. And I enjoyed how outside the box it was and how it wasn’t afraid to push any boundaries. Everyone who I got into it liked it and said it was the first show they had liked that much in a while. Not to mention it was another master class Brit Marling role. ❤️
The OA,The ending of S1 really put me off S2
The OA,"I watched season one, but i thought the finale was kinda cringe."
The OA,"The season 1 was so flat. Slow, grey, and i literally cannot remember any character outside of the main lead. If they wanted to do wacky spqce and continuum jumping concept, they had 5 episodes to get to that idea, not whole season."
The OA,"Am I the only person who felt like this show was terrible?


The premise is interesting but most of the execution made me cringe


It was compelling like a car crash is compelling in my opinion, but not more."
The OA,Show was corny af
The OA,"I was interested when the show launched, but then I heard something about the ending (not sure if it was S01 or S02 being so stupid it invalidated the whole show I never checked it out. Should I watch it?"
The OA,Show was terrible.
The OA,This show was such dogshit.
The OA,[deleted]
The OA,That show was garbage bullshit. I’m glad they canceled.
The OA,"This show was unwatchable, never got the hype."
The OA,This is my most bitter Netflix cancelation. I need the rest of the story
The OA,"The world wasn’t ready for the OA. This cancellation hurt. Brilliant show. 

I loved it from the moment I saw it. When you watched it, you couldn’t question the weird shit - you just had to believe what was happening was true to the world and keep watching."
The OA,"Yeah s2 pretty much made it a different shoe 
S1 I think was hard for some to get into"
The OA,"This was my favorite show that Netflix had. I was entranced and could not wait for the next season. I also loved 1899 and couldn’t wait for the next season of that after the crazy cliffhanger. Same with Teenage Bounty Hunters. 

All three shows got cancelled before the next season and I was so upset. I cancelled my subscription after 1899 got cancelled."
The OA,"People really need to get over this show. It wasn’t cancelled prematurely, it was a miracle the show even got a season 2 at all."
The OA,"I cancelled Netflix over this and Santa Clarita Diet, they both ended on cliffhangers and I felt Netflix would continue to do this malarkey."
The OA,This show had mediocre critique and reception till it was cancelled. It was a meme in this very sub.
The OA,I learned the moves and everything. 💔
The OA,This is on my watch list and I didn't realize it was cancelled. It makes me irrationally angry that they advertise a show to me that they know I won't ever get an ending to. It will be coming off my list I guess.
The OA,Biggest disappointment I've ever had in any show. lol. Last episode was a complete fucking joke where we laughed out loud and looked at each other in disbelief.
The OA,The shower never really recovered from the end of season 1. There were so many memes.
The OA,The OA was a prank enacted on all of us
The OA,"I will say I enjoyed the series, it was strange and artistic and very beautifully portrayed through cinematography and choreography and quality acting and directing but there was no profound epiphany from watching this series. Not that there needs to be, but there was no depth beyond that and it seems the people here are alluding to a meaningfulness beyond objective beauty that in my opinion, wasn't there.

I'm not a professional critic and my opinion could possibly be garbage idk because that's how little I know about theater."
The OA,"People kept praising this show so I tried watching. Interesting premise but it got boring fast. After awhile I didn’t care about the big mystery because I didn’t care about any of the characters enough to want to find out. 
Sorry but it was cancelled for a reason."
The OA,S1 still is One of the best shows I ever watched
The OA,"If you look like a show like Severance, I think The OA would do amazing things on Apple TV."
The OA,"Fucking amazing show. I still mourn its cancellation. Even if it was never a mega-hit, it had the potential to be amazing if they had been able to tell the complete story.  I still hold out hope that one day they can finish it, somewhere, somehow."
The OA,"This reminds me of Westworld’s premature cancellation and how David Zaslav, President and CEO of WB and the exec who cancelled the show, allegedly adores peeing himself in public, if only to feel something next to his cold, dead, rotting heart."
The OA,I don’t think they advertised it well enough. I had no idea what it was about and just ignored it for ages. One day randomly watched 1 episode and got hooked.  I don’t understand why there’s no explanation as to why it was cancelled. It’s head and shoulder above so many other shows on there.
The OA,"Every season just took it to another level.

It was so emotionally confusing and watching the story unfold you’re just constantly looking for any clue to grasp what’s actually happening.

What’s going on with the bodies in the desert mounted in the witches cabin? 

It was building into a type of Doctor Who. 

Was a wild ride."
The OA,"Never went back to netflix since they cancelled this show… but Sorry for my ignorance but such a good show, shouldn’t HBO, FX or AMAZON can’t make a gamble here?"
The OA,"I’m still salty about Santa Clarita, Teenage Bounty Hunters, Society, 1899 and Warrior Nun. Noticing a trend atm"
The OA,This is the show I am most angry is canceled.
The OA,"This has to be the worst cancelling of a show ever.

I was, and still am quite pissed off about it.

One of the best shows I have watched, and never thought it would get cancelled."
The OA,The OA was the second time in my adult life that I genuinely dealt with and grappled with loss.  It still stings like a MF.
The OA,That show died with that cringe ass dance stopping a school shooting
The OA,Also is Netflix banning them from releasing it elsewhere? Even if they released the ending in a book form I would read it.
The OA,Do you think there is a chance for a season three? Or even a one off?!
The OA,"The second season wasn't as good as the first and I didn't feel like it needed to go as wacky as they did; but I still really enjoyed it.

Really wish they would have given them a third season to close out the story though.

That first season remains magical."
The OA, Long love the OA
The OA,Reddit is not real life. The OA was a terrible show.
The OA,"Do wonder the economics of Netflix were its apparently not economics in giving most tv shows a ending.

Can that model be a long term success?"
The OA,"Fuck Netflix, I will never forget that they cancelled the OA"
Crazyhead,"Now I know how Brits feel when they see American commercials for American shows. 

""That looks amazing. Are we ever going to get it here?"" 

Because, seriously, I want to see this. "
Crazyhead,Misfits is the shit.  I am well up for this.
Crazyhead,Is Nathan in it?
Crazyhead,It's great so far.
Crazyhead,This looks like it could be a lot of fun.
Crazyhead,"I love Misfits and this show looks promising. After watching the trailer, I'm really interested in watching it. Thanks for uploading it!"
Crazyhead,[deleted]
Crazyhead,"This looks good, hopefully it's better than his other show Aliens"
Crazyhead,Always nice to see Tony Curran pop up.
Crazyhead,Reaper was a good show based on a similar but more comedic premise. I will check this out.
Crazyhead,British Ash v. Evil Dead?
Crazyhead,"I love the Misfits, but I would watch this for the Buffy references alone. "
Crazyhead,Isn't this the woman from Chewing Gum?
Crazyhead,"I feel like the trailer doesn't exactly show what it's gonna be about. I get the demons from hell thing but what's the deal with the two ladies? Do they have superpowers to deal with the demons or will they just be two normal person trying to stop demons in wacky and comedic ways?  

The trailer looks like it has scenes from two different shows mashed up together. An Awkward like teen comedy-drama with the two girls and a supernatural show with the scenes of the demon guy."
Crazyhead,I hope he has an ending in mind this time
Crazyhead,"It was co-funded by Netflix, hence they have global streaming rights i believe. Your lucky day!"
Crazyhead,Most US shows are available in the UK  the morning after screening in the US. 
Crazyhead,He would just leave anyways!
Crazyhead,All of them. Howard wrote all episodes of seasons 1 and 2 but only 6 out of 8 of the episodes in the remaining seasons. 
Crazyhead,I assume the person who came up with the idea of the show in the first place judging by the title.
Crazyhead,Or Fades
Crazyhead,"Yeah, I like it a lot... just finished it... it isn't great TV, and it isn't as good as Misfits (same Creator)... but it is still a nice fun show that swerves between super dark and funny at breakneck speeds, which is something I dig.... It is kind of like Grimm, minus all the filler, with more interesting characters and heaps more charm, with some of that good awkward British humor to tie it all together... the mythology isn't that great though, and you have to overlook some sloppy plotting... but at 6 episodes it is just the right length to be a fun ride."
Crazyhead,"Yep, I enjoyed it. Tried to post about it when it showed up on Netflix but I guess I shouldn't of posted an old trailer because it was deleted. It was created by Misfits' Howard Overman and reminds me of it in small ways. It's worth watching for sure."
Crazyhead,Watched halfway so far. It's funny and dark as fuck in a schizophrenic sort of way
Crazyhead,"Yeaah its pretty funny, def worth watching"
Crazyhead,My husband loved it.
Crazyhead,Yea its funny and cool
Crazyhead,"> the mythology isn't that great though, and you have to overlook some sloppy plotting

Agreed. Annoyingly, it looks like the Misfits creator might repeat all the same mistakes that turned the amazing Misfits S1 into the unwatchable later seasons.

Already the primary world-building doesn't really make any sense (How exactly does hitting them with a metal stick contribute to a demon free world...? Did she seriously never try an exorcism until that point...? Etc., etc.)

Hopefully the series gets a larger budget for later seasons, and thus more writers to help out. That might stop all the frustratingly irrational behavior on the part of the lead characters, just as a lazy plot device. (E.g., No, girl, you don't need to go to the hospital/Can you date Jake already and move that whole thing along...?)

Honestly, it might be best to avoid the show until more seasons are out. Just to avoid the possibility of slog through increasingly unwatchable hours of TV (while hoping it'll get better)."
Crazyhead,"or do what I did, and just set your expectations low...  there are different tiers of television...  there is stuff you analyze and obsess over every detail, or watch for the nuance and poetry... there are shows that are just mindless fun.... and there are shows on every level inbetween.... when I watch The Flash, I am often disappointed by the completely illogical BS going on, or the irrational character behaviors and such... but after catching myself thinking that I remind myself that it is just a dumb show, and I try to enjoy it as is...  I think crazyhead does a better job than the flash in that it moves along at a faster quip...  6 episodes versus 22... less will they wont they bullshit, less meaningless melodrama , etc... they just about equally don't make sense...  but I am in and out of crazyhead in 6 episodes"
Crazyhead,[deleted]
Crazyhead,"I enjoyed it too, definitely fun. I like SCD as well but I did like this more.

I read the synopsis for it and was interested, I googled it and saw reviews comparing it to Misfits and Buffy, I'm a big fan of both and since I found out it was the same creator as Misfits, I had to give it a try.

I hope there's a 2nd series!"
Crazyhead,I was pleasently surprised. I hadn't heard anything about it and just popped it on one day. I watched it again the next day. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention. It was really well done all around.
Crazyhead,I liked the show a lot however I felt some pretty rough juxtaposition between humor and the gore/horror bits. I personally (aka opinion) think they should have either gone full on serious tone or full on comedic tone. Let's see what season two has for us.
Crazyhead,"Fair enough, it's not ground breaking by any means. I think I was just happy with the quality after knowing nothing going in."
Crazyhead,"I liked the mix though, felt they captured it quite well without being too campy.  One of the villain's complaining about how hard it is to get baby sitting was brilliant."
Crazyhead,"This was my beef with The Santa Clarita Diet. Though I thought they balanced it well in Crazy Head, it would be a totally different show if they went one way or the other. However, I felt Spoon-face's precognition was a stretch for the show and a lazy plot tool."
Crazyhead,"I was quite surprised too.

Like you two, it's not a show that changed my life or anything, but it was good fun and I don't regret the time I spent with the characters."
Crazyhead,It is awesome.
Crazyhead,I love this show very funny and engaging show. I cannot wait for the next season 
Crazyhead,I am really loving it. The first episode was pretty great. I love that Raquel and Amy don't just fall in line after their meet cute. Their friendship feels real. 
Crazyhead,It's definitely a lot of fun.
Crazyhead,Are you sure there will be one? It doesn't seem to be a very popular show.
Crazyhead,"The characters and their relationship are definitely the main reason to watch, so I think you'll like the rest of it too. "
Crazyhead,[deleted]
Crazyhead,[deleted]
Crazyhead,I had was hoping OA would get a season 3
Crazyhead,Glow for sure bothers me. Daybreak was fun and definitely santa Clarita diet
Crazyhead,"I'm not sure what you expect. From shows i've personally watched on this list, Altered Carbon, Luke Cage, Age of Resistance - they finished their current arcs. They might not have Big Finale, but they don't leave some main plots unresolved. Cage and Iron Fists were also cancelled due to Disney pulling their license. Glow got  kinda fucked and got cancelled due to increasing costs of production under COVID regulations. Mindhunter (i assume you mean Netflix production without  *s*) stalled production due to Fincher overthinking everything and moving to other projects.

A lot of best shows in history doesn't have Big Finale. They just... End, and the life continues after cameras are shut down. It doesn't make them in any way bad. Just not every story need Endgame as a finale to tie everything up in neat package. 

For clarity  i would recommend moving all non-originals on the bottom of the list."
Crazyhead,"Deadly Class isn't a Netflix show.

October Faction got cancelled though."
Crazyhead,"My take: very few shows stick the landing. Most shows have to stop, because the audience lost interest, usually because the quality dropped far enough. Why should their finale be anything memorable/mind blowing now? If nothing sticks with me after a series ends, it might as well end on a cliffhanger. Of course I'm sad about premature cancellations of shows I'm currently watching, but it isn't the first and won't be the last time. And when I'm sad about it, then it means it at least entertained me enough to care."
Crazyhead,"Kim's Convenience The last episode they put the lights out, that is not a ending?"
Crazyhead,"I can't do a list, but I know for a fact that I Am Not Okay With This was cut off at a clifflhanger, but to me it still felt quite satisfying. I hope I helped a bit ^^"
Crazyhead,"If it’s not a Netflix Original, it’s not a Netflix show. Take them off the list lol. This thread…"
Crazyhead,"I love this subreddits Netflix hate boner… how is this a “problem” for the service?  Networks have canceled shows forever, good and bad, the only difference here is that those mainly disappear from a catalog and Netflix has them there still.

This isn’t a new practice.  Maybe the idea of this thread isn’t a bad one, but it’s phrased in the same overly dramatic way anything about Netflix is posted here."
Crazyhead,"If you're going to put Iron Fist and Luke Cage on here, you could put all of the other Marvel shows (Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones) on here too. Although I'm not sure they fit as neatly because generally all of the Marvel shows did have resolution to their season plots, just left some foreshadowing for the next seasons open."
Crazyhead,Insatiable
Crazyhead,"Daredevil

The Get Down - it had an ending, but it was clearly very rushed and the fates of certain characters were never revealed

Dogs of Berlin - Netflix never announced a cancellation, but it’s been 2.5 years since it was released and the final episode was inconclusive"
Crazyhead,Crazyhead
Crazyhead,Friends From College.
Crazyhead,Iron Fist and Luke Cage.
Crazyhead,Hemlock Grove had an ending.
Crazyhead,Is altered carbon worth watching without a true ending? I was *just* about to start binging it.
Crazyhead,"I'd love someone else's take, but I wouldn't say Designated Survivor fully had an ending. Netflix took over in Season 3, and then cancelled it."
Crazyhead,"Thanks for adding Messiah, that show was shockingly smart"
Crazyhead,Everything ends brother
Crazyhead,"Probably Glitch Techs, but it still hasn't been officially announced as cancelled."
Crazyhead,It's Bruno does not fit on this list. The first season was very self contained.
Crazyhead,I think you'd be better off with a list of finished shows. That would be very short list.
Crazyhead,The Mist?
Crazyhead,"You have to define what you mean by *ending*. I would not consider many shows on your list, e.g Mind Hunter, need an ending."
Crazyhead,Omg guys calm the fuck down. Its just words its not gonna hurt you. go out and touch some grass or some shit
Crazyhead,[deleted]
Crazyhead,V wars is apparently cancelled
Crazyhead,Sense8 ever get a real ending?
Crazyhead,Tidelands and Altered Carbon.
Crazyhead,Cursed and Jupiters Legacy
Crazyhead,Gypsy
Crazyhead,"4400. Not a Netflix show but being streamed there. Got cancelled just as it was getting good.

Also The Beauty and The Baker. Again, not a Netflix show but streaming."
Crazyhead,"Sword of trust. Actually a great movie, until suddenly it ends very annoyingly & with no real resolution.

I heard that a woman who directed & wrote it died, & that's very sad but releasing it without a real ending was a total bummer."
Crazyhead,"La Revolution and Black Spot

Still salty about those two."
Crazyhead,You could be meta with The OA and say that they're in our world lol
Crazyhead,"Santa Clarita Diet doesn't have a conclusive ending with all questions answered, per se, but the end of it is an ending. If they had placed ""and they lived happily ever after"" on the screen after the last scene it would function perfectly fine as an ending."
Crazyhead,"Defenders was a one off season if memory serves?

ASOUE followed the books so proper ending/planned."
Crazyhead,"So mad about Dark Crystal, Glow and Mindhunter."
Crazyhead,Sense8
Crazyhead,Happy... great show
Crazyhead,"I think insatiable has an ending, a comic ending for a comic series, it leaves open for more, but isint the same as the OA or Santa Clarita that really needed another season."
Crazyhead,Insatiable got canceled after season 2
Crazyhead,The Never Ending Stories TV version
Crazyhead,"""Everything Sucks"" is the one that hurts the most for me because I think it was a pretty great first season and wanted to see more...but I can understand that it probably ended at a decent enough spot...until the guy's dad shows up!"
Crazyhead,Mindhunter is just on hiatus.
Crazyhead,the stranded was officially cancelled. i think its bruno had a nice ending and maybe we will even get new episodes since the show hasnt been cancelled.
Crazyhead,I think I’d rather see a list of shows that have an ending so I k ow which ones to look through.
Crazyhead,Everything sucks. It didn’t end on a cliffhanger but I know it only got one season
Crazyhead,/r/doesitresolve
Crazyhead,"It's been almost a year since it came out, and there's still no news on renewal/cancellation (which makes me think things don't look good for renewal), so I'm not sure if you'd count it, but I would say Julie and the Phantoms."
Crazyhead,"Its ridiculous how much cancelled unfinished shit they have.  Like I've been saying ever since they cancelled Teenage Bounty Hunters, before long, people will need a ""does the dog die dot com,"" except it will be ""does the netflix show get cancelled without a finale dot com.""  Which is exactly what this thread is about in a way.     
         
Ten years from now their back catalog is going to just be a complete minefield of unfished shit that you are afraid to even bother starting.  Not to mention, who wants to start a new netflix show in its first season when the odds are that it gets cancelled are so high?"
Crazyhead,If you're ana Amazon prime member Bosch is a fantastic series!
Crazyhead,"I think only Bojack Horseman, OITNB and House of Cards have endings with only Bojack having a great final season.

I think the original shows that Netflix launched got their time and closure but none of the new stuff really has."
Crazyhead,This should be stickied.
Backstage,As someone who has just watched all of Taskmaster I can't wait for this. It's going to be great.
Backstage,"The British stuff I've seen (Big Fat Quizzes, Taskmaster, Bake Off, QI) is just so lovely and charming. Even when they're ragging on each other it's the way you would do with your friends.

American TV has this disgusting addiction to hyper inflated drama and unhealthy attitudes about competition (for 20 years now 'I'm not here to make friends' has been the call sign of the money-hungry rabid American because their own economy has failed them). 

The panel format and the structure and the personalities are just...'I'm here for a good time' and that's me."
Backstage,"I'm not going to comment on the content of the video but the QUALITY.  The set up, explaining everything, having the captions and then wrapping it up nicely. This is the most time i've spent watching The View ever.

"
Backstage,"You can't argue ""rationally"" with someone who equates the morning after pill to leaving a living breathing baby in the streets. That's just stupid."
Backstage,"Granted I'm not exactly The View's target demo, but I've literally never seen a clip of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in which she doesn't come across as a thoroughly entitled, stupid, unreasonable, and disagreeable woman. "
Backstage,">	She reprimanded me like a child

Then don’t act like a fucking child"
Backstage,"This is her entire career at The View in a nutshell. Only ever seeing things her way or the highway,playing the victim as if she being bullied."
Backstage,The final shot is hilarious 
Backstage,Was that Lisa Loeb still looking hot in glasses after twenty years.
Backstage,I don’t know why but I love View drama. It’s a serious defect of mine.
Backstage,"> ""Hasselbeck, who argued taking the (morning after) pill is “**the same thing as birthing a baby and leaving it out in the street,**” wouldn’t let the other co-hosts provide their opposing points of view.""

Holy exaggeration, Batman.  It's almost like the forced birther Talibangelicals aren't in favor of things that would make abortion unnecessary in the first place and they want to punish women who have sex for any other reason than making babies.

I have little patience for these misogynistic knuckle dragging dumbfucks dredged up from the Dark Ages."
Backstage,"She's threw a fit because she wasn't able to control the conversation once someone with actual experience stepped in. You want to yell over your co-hosts and act like a child, you'll be spoken to like you are one. "
Backstage,"Telling her she’s a pro psychologically convinced her to stop acting immature because she wanted to live up to the compliment.  In reality, she’s not a pro.  She has no training as a journalist or on-air personality.  “The View” just scoured reality shows for the “everyday woman” slot.  Barbara was right in that getting heated has no place in debate, even if you’re passionate about the topic.  But she was too sensitive to hear it and took it personally."
Backstage,She wouldnt be the first host of that show that didnt think much of Barbara Walters though.
Backstage,[deleted]
Backstage,[removed]
Backstage,Wow.  I did not think she was being scolded at all.  Talk about an overreaction
Backstage,I was getting pissed how everyone was taking EH side instead of BW side. But I guess they were trying to get her to go back on the show and agreeing with her was the best way. I can't fucking stand her. 
Backstage,[deleted]
Backstage,She's a reality show loser. Never forget.
Backstage,I want her “Fuck that!” To be my new text notification
Backstage,"Being on that inane show would drive anyone insane.

Norm MacDonald on Barbara Walters:

Backstage,"These fucking retards just can't get it through their skulls that the morning after pill doesn't ""end life."" it can take hours after sex for the sperm to reach an egg and fertilize. All Plan B does is give you what amounts to a birth control ""booster shot"" that makes it so the egg can't be fertilized when the sperm arrives. If the egg has already been fertilized, it doesn't work."
Backstage,Stop making stupid people famous.
Backstage,I used to get woodies from Hasselbeck... then I found out she's a moron.
Backstage,"Regardless, “Ladies Who Punch: The Explosive Inside Story of ‘The View'"" is a pretty amazing name for that book."
Backstage,"If Barbara Walters asking you to be reasonable and considerate of others makes you fly off the handle like this, maybe the problem is inside you."
Backstage,"""This is a slippery slope to eliminating life."" Is she trying to say that preventing the creation of fetuses will inevitably lead to legalization of killing children?"
Backstage,"She freaked out for no reason, the old lady basically said we have to have these general discussions without getting loud and emotional, which is exactly what blondie did."
Backstage,"She really didn’t act like a child up until the point where she threw a fit and tried to quit. She was, like she said, Passionate but she went from professional to childish real quick. "
Backstage,I enjoyed her f-bombs.
Backstage,God she acted like a fucking child... Good lord. Pay me what they were paying her and Barbara Walters can say whatever the fuck she wants to me. 
Backstage,"I don't agree with Elisabeth Hasselbeck about pretty much anything, particularly her views about the morning after pill being literally the same as giving birth to a child and abandoning it in the street. 

That aside, I found Barbara Walters to be rather condescending in how she handled this situation. In the last few years on ""The View"", you could tell her abilities were slipping away - she often could not keep up with the pace, talked in circles, etc. And, in some cases, was just plain offensive in her treatment of cohosts and guests. One case that comes to mind is her chastising Corey Feldman for insinuating that there were predatory men who were sexually abusing young actors in Hollywood (something we now know to be very, very true). 

Barbara was a great news broadcaster, but woefully inept at being engaging, interesting, or insightful when it came to Hollywood or her personal politics, which is a lot of what The View shaped into being.

You don’t put up a topic as delicate as pro-life vs. pro-choice and then shout down the lone conservative voice – nothing is accomplished that way. You let them give their thoughts and then you debate them on that; not get personal or condescending. Of course, Hasselbeck was also guilty of this herself, as she would often cut off or shout over her co-hosts to get her shots in. In this clip, it really wasn't that bad - Walters could have just simply cut to commercial instead of spending another 30 seconds talking down to her.

I did feel for Elisabeth in that moment, but then of course she has to give her [over-the-top, condescending response on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv4SleLlj0_/?utm_source=ig_embed) which almost obliterates any of that goodwill. 

We just listened to the audio of you freaking out about Barbara Walters and then the second the cameras are back on air you’re literally in her lap. You’re an absolute hypocrite. All of this “God guides me” dramatics doesn’t cover that up. It comes across as disingenuous when all you do is talk about God in response to things. Take responsibility for your life and actions rather than referring to some invisible entity when it’s convenient to do so."
Backstage,"She was a Grade-A nincompoop. Luckily for Elisabeth, Fox News is always hiring Nincompoops. "
Backstage,"Between the cutoff and crowd reaction I think 0:51 is probably where she snapped. She sounded like a pissed off teenager or drunk girl.
"
Backstage,With the producer having to beg her to come back with seconds spare. She sounds like a god damned nightmare. This reads like a bad Sorkin show rip off. 
Backstage,"I kind of wish they'd bring back Hasselbeck cause even tho she's not smart, she's entertaining as hell "
Backstage,"She will go with the ol womens stand by.

She will say a man was responsible for making her do it.

Then the ""feminists"" will come out in full force and label her a victim."
Backstage,Jesus she sounds like a particulary slow child...
Backstage,What a baby 
Backstage,wow shes still a stunner
Backstage,"Reddit trashes conservative folks. Whats next, cop eating a donut?"
Backstage,"Awwwww poor snowflake Hasselbeck...

Here is part of her reaction to the clip being released:

... “It was a battle -but not of the flesh. I used fighting words because I believe that God decides the value of the lives of babies.” 

&#x200B;

The same god that kills thousands if not millions of babies in the old testament? Riiiiiiight...."
Backstage,[removed]
Backstage,Came cus I remember her from survivor lol she was my winner pick when I watched her season for the first time 2-ish years ago.
Backstage,She had guts to work on that show. Filmed in NYC.
Backstage,Why is this news? It happened 13 years ago and literally affected nobody but people who worked on the show at the time.
Backstage,"*sighs* 

Women. "
Backstage,she is an always will be a cuuunt!
Backstage,"I dont know who this woman is, but its clear that shes a silly cunt. "
Backstage,Isn't the View a bunch of old bags having a melt down every weekday anyways??
Backstage,Rosie O must have leaked this online since her recent lesbo assertions about Hassleback pissed her off. 
Backstage,"I dont get why this was recorded and also posted. 

Who would betray someone and post one of their meltdowns?"
Backstage,"I have more respect for Elizabeth Hasslebeck now...? However marginal that's a turn I didn't see coming.

This, like those sports dustups between teammates in a huddle or on the sideline that get so much press, is normal. I really don't know why we care about it like we do. ""Oh, these abstract TV people can get emotional and worked up just like us? Well look at that! Here's my license to punch up"""
Backstage,"And here you find the reason why the stereotype of the “hysterical woman” exisits. Doing a disservice to herself and women everywhere. She’s worried about getting dressed down on TV, but 100% unaware of making herself look like a loon on TV. The worst part is she has no idea how wrong she is and then she just gets reinforced by others, not becuase she is right but becuase it’s easier to get what they want if she calms down. "
Backstage,I hope Ben Shapiro gets his wish to be a guest on the View one day. 
Backstage,"Jesus Christ, pure insanity on so many levels lol. "
Backstage,"
EDIT: sorry, on mobile and accidentally posted as a reply instead of general comment. 


She didn’t walk away yelling about unborn babies. She stormed off yelling about her perception of being reprimanded. 

This has nothing to do with the fetuses, it has everything to her being a spoiled child. "
Backstage,If this was in a movie I'd think it was an exaggeration.

Backstage,"Well, it is a baby.  It's literally just a matter of time before it's walking around on the streets.

Just because someone cannot currently survive outside their current environment doesn't mean they aren't worthy of empathy and protection.

Backstage,then they got the same thing on fucking steroids by hiring Meghan McCain
Backstage,"There's a weird problem with modern ""conservatives"", probably because of the swing toward anti-intellectualism, where they are absolute snowflakes and fall apart when people justifiably question their ignorant beliefs.  At least the old school conservatives like Buckley knew their shit and could remain somewhat calm under scrutiny, though even he had a meltdown with Vidal and started hurling homosexual slurs.

I guess when you hold indefensible positions, you literally can't defend them and so your mind just takes a dump on itself when put in that position.  "
Backstage,"> but I've literally never seen a clip of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in which she doesn't come across as a thoroughly entitled, stupid, unreasonable, and disagreeable woman.

Backstage,I think a ton of suburban housewives would love her though 
Backstage,"> but I've literally never seen a clip of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in which she doesn't come across as a thoroughly entitled, stupid, unreasonable, and disagreeable woman

And I've never come across a clip of Cosby or Weinstein where they come across as creepy or lustful or rapey. That's sort of the point of the edit. It's how come O'Reilly came across differently talking about white privilege on the daily show compared to on his own show. Redditors suddenly started agreeing with O'Reilly once they saw a different edit of his white privilege bullshit.

You can make the biggest idiot look like a genius or a genius look like an idiot. The Daily Show edited Bill Nye to make him look like David Duke for suggesting we should be exploring space. I'm sure Elizabeth comes off a lot better when someone who doesnt hate her is in charge of editing

In fact I know it. She was portrayed like a real life Sarah Conner during her Survivor seasons. And that was before she was famous. "
Backstage,"And then the producers coddled her like a child and made it seem like Barbara was to blame so she would cool down and back on the show. The reason she flew off the handle was she was already overheated on the subject, which makes what Barbara said 100% valid. She was loosing her shit before they even went to the commercial break. If I was in a discussion with someone and they were using that tone and basically hyperventilation, I'd try to diffuse it exactly like Barbara did. If we can't talk like adults, lets not talk about this at all."
Backstage,That's exactly what I thought.  She was being unprofessional and behaved unprofessionally afterwards.  That kind of behavior isn't usually equated with maturity. 
Backstage,So basically what Meghan McCain is now
Backstage,The clip was from 2006. But yeah. She was an underappreciated beauty. 
Backstage,Wonder if she said Stay (I Missed You) to Elisabeth
Backstage,"thanks, i knew who that was but totally forgot her name."
Backstage,"She’s definitely fucked guys for not having babies before. Technically in most Christian sects, the morning after pill is a mortal sin and  sex for non pro-creation is sinful - so if you care about your religion you probably should agree with her "
Backstage,Reminds of that time Jon Stewart had this anti ACA women on his show. She was going around the news channels talking about death panels. Then she comes on the Daily Show and Jon Stewart has the entire ACA bill in front of him and asks her to point the death panels in the bill and she cant. Up until that point no one on any of those news channels questioned her. 
Backstage,The real pro is Bill Geddie for getting her back on stage so quickly.
Backstage,Wasn't mean at all really.
Backstage,Nah. She can act like an adult
Backstage,"To be fair to her, Barbera was absolutely condescending during this segment. Which she usually is. But honestly, I wouldn't want to be talked to like that on live television either. I completely disagree with Hasselbeck's position. But Barbera throwing around backhanded condescension while simultaneously talking about taking the high road is frustrating for me just sitting here and watching the clip. Being the person on the other end of that would probably warrant such a reaction.

This should have been a 'lets agree to disagree and move on' but the little jab by Barbera at the end ignited the whole thing.
"
Backstage,"As the article says, she was also pregnant at the time. It must have been uncomfortable to talk about abortion specifically morning after pills while pregnant. I am pro-choice, but I can see how anyone can make a connection from abortion to miscarriage. If you are pregnant, then the idea of a miscarriage is awful. As far as her emotions, pregnancy does have an effect on hormones and function which may have added to her stress."
Backstage,"I mean, Barbara was being condescending, but I don't think it was on purpose.  It's just what happens when an adult starts speaking after a child throws a tantrum.  Any healthy response is going to look condescending. "

Backstage,"She was being 'handled', they didn't really agree with her. They had a show they wanted to continue and they needed their brat back on set. "
Backstage,"I don't think they were talking her side, I think they were saying what they needed to say to calm her down and get the show moving.  You ever watch 30 Rock?  Basically what Liz did with Tracy and Jenna all the time"
Backstage,"Yeah but so do liberals. It's always shocking to them when they meet people who don't agree with their genderbending mental gymnastics, for example, then they immediately label them as nazis and retreat back into their bubble. 

Face it. You've let the craziest, dumbest and loudest people take the lead on debates on both sides and now none of you can stand each other. Great job 👍👍"
Backstage,"Barbara Walters is retiring from The View. Actually, she announced it 5 years ago, but nobody could hear her over those yammering bitches"
Backstage,"Yeah, people in this thread are throwing a ton of personal attacks at Hasslebeck, but I get the feeling that this has been building up for a long time until she snapped.  On top of that, she's complaining because it happened ""on air"".  It's not that she can't handle what was said, she's angry because of how it happened."
Backstage,I like this line of argument pretending Mrs. Hasselbeck is totally normal and sane and it's the fault of that old hag.... and here is a has been rarely funny Norm MacDonald with an intellectual opinion! Oh boy
Backstage,"Here is the appearance that got him banned

Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Still is! basically just ""if bruce wayne has a mech"" and also everyone in gotham has amnesia. i still rewatch it about once a year, so much style in that show"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Nothing makes you feel old like finding out Toonami turned 25.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Optimus Prime talking about machines/computers wiping out humanity as they grow self aware. 10/10
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Was that a site like Limewire?
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"**YES THIS IS IT!!!!**

Holy shit, thank you. I'm about to look for their old school bumps and just vibe out to nostalgia."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,I remember a cartoon channel put together a bunch of clips of various cartoons set to Bare Naked Ladies “Falling For The First Time” and it always stuck with me.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,If you're interested the band that does this is called Pain and they make great ska music
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"[This is a great channel for that](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlimD716V2/videos), all of Toonami's finest remastered in stunning HD"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Well aware, but thank you! I'm sure Pain is the root of my love for ska as an adult."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"This show is a masterclass of raising stakes in a story.  Do not sleep on it, even if it is dated."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Man, first Babylon 5 is remastered on HBO Max,and now Mobile Suit Gundam is finally streaming.  Good week for sci-fi."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

After giving it a re-watch, be2i love the spin offs 08th MS team and sequel, Zeta Gundam. I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Recommended watching for seasoned mech fans if they haven't already seen it. 

It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

Also the robots r kewl."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,My body is ready for the Bright Slap.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"If you’ve never seen MSG and start with this, don’t worry if it’s not your cup of tea. The fun thing about it is there’s a Gundam for everyone. So you could try one of the other series. Want one that’s coo coo bananas? G Gundam baby! Small scale drama with a Romeo and Juliet bent? 08th MS Team (my personal favorite). There’s even ones that are beyblade with Gundam in Build Drivers. Possibilities are endless"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,[deleted]
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I just checked a week ago and was super disappointed. Checked it this morning and there it is! 

Man. Brings me back to the days of running to the living room, plugging in the code to turn the huge satellite dish, and then going downstairs to watch it with my glass of milk and Oreo pop tarts on my tiny tv."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I was really impressed when I watched this. They did an amazing job of actually making the enemy into human beings instead of just fist shaking villains. Plus, they actually had a setting in which they convinced me that using giant robots to fight made sense."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I just wish we could get Zeta on streaming now, but I assume due to rights issues, pertaining to the opening, that won't happen."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"This show is awful, guys. Nobody watch it. Whole series is based on a lie.

The One Year War doesn’t even last one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,A story so good they told it again uh how many series are just a new take on MSG? 7 or so I think
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Can someone verify that this is what **Gundam origins** is the prequel too.  I confused myself reading up on it.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,I wish I could bundle this service with other things. The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch but if it were a small add on to like Hulu this would be great.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,will hello kitty appear in the new time line?
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,I tried to get into this but couldn't :(
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Great news! I do, however, prefer the the theatrical movies, which do a good job at condensing the series and trimming out the unnecessary fat, not to mention they redid some scenes that looked kind of bad on the show. I'm just sad that we've yet to receive a proper remake of the original. The Origin OVA doesn't cover the whole Origin manga (which is an excellent remake of the original series, authored/illustrated by the original character designer). I'm also sad that we never got a 90s remake in the style of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRtFptEMF8). Damn it would've looked good!"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,No MSG added.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,They're lucky they weren't sued for stealing the lightsaber.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"If your really into this kind of old anime I would suggest watching Legion of the galactic hero's, it's sort of like the [anime version of babylon 5] (https://i.imgur.com/jiVJML3.jpg). They [remade] (https://i.imgur.com/WaDOMAy.jpg) the first two seasons in 2018."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Great!.

Now someone please sort out the details for Space Battleship Yamato (1974).

Can't even find a boxed set for the series that isn't insane due to being out of print."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,So will this be on HBO Max???
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Huge Gundam fan! Such a classic!
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"It also has an amazingly funky soundtrack!

Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Babylon 5 is being remaster wha??
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,MSG is also on Funimation's streaming service BTW if you prefer mostly dub offerings. Just an FYI.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Yeah there's an episode where Amuro goes fully catatonic and Bright just has him strapped into the gundam and sent off, figuring that once he was in battle he'd snap out of it when his survival instinct kicked in."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Huh, sounds like Evangelion."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"> 
> It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time. gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

I'd highly recommend checking out Zambot 3, it's Tomino's(Director / Creator of Gundam) previous work that pushed the boundaries on robot anime. Suffice to say a lot of shit gets fucked up and it's not all goofiness."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,08th MS Team is also my favorite. It really hit me different from anything else I had ever seen from Anime up to that point. It was also one of my favorite Gundam toys since it had the working backpack haha.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I fuckin love G Gundam. It's definitely part nostalgia from it airing on Cartoon Network after school when I was a kid. But that series is what got me into Gundam. Everyone hates on it, but its hands down my favorite from what I've seen."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,I liked G Gundam. I liked Gundam Wing more.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Yeah if I'm recommending something to non-anime fans, MSG is not where I'd usually start. It can be...tedious. It is more for the anime fan who wants to see the classic roots of a franchise that now spans several universes."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"9/11 happened and killed off the anime that was ""too serious."" Then Toonami got moved to Saturday and Miguzi, which was lighter fare with shows like Teen Titans and Code Lyoko, took over on weekdays."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Oh man, is it your first time watching? You're in for a ride! Definitely check out Zeta Gundam when you finish and the rest of the UC and other Gundam and mecha stuff in general. There's some incredible stuff out there that deals with some really heavy themes.

If you have any questions or need reccomendations, the folks over at r/Gundam are super friendly! Welcome, fellow Newtype!"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"They simply replaced the opening song on the blu-ray, surely they could do that for streaming."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I haven't seen Gundam and don't know the story of it beyond that people pilot robots but if a war happened *within* one year then I think ""One Year War"" is an appropriate name for it."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Origins won't make sense until you watch the original series.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I'll confirm it.  Sure. 

I've seen most of the gundam universe, and honestly don't have any idea what goes where, but I'll confirm it

Shining Finger! buh buh da buh da ba da!"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"The free version of crunchyroll has pretty much everything (barring certain original stuff), you just have to wait a week for new things and a lot of stuff isn't in HD."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,">The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

I watch crunchyroll free of charge without ads. Just use an adblocking browser extension."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Isn’t it cheaper than every other streaming service?
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"> The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch

They also have some non-anime stuff like 
 cherry magic that was one of top shows in japan last year https://www.crunchyroll.com/cherry-magic-thirty-years-of-virginity-can-make-you-a-wizard"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,MSG had already showed up on Funi's streaming service and a lot of their offerings end up on Hulu so who knows.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,They did just release a hello kitty gundam.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"The animation is dated and there was a lot of goofiness, because it had a lot of super robot tropes.

I'd try the movie trilogy, but it's not properly dubbed or legally available."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Try “War in the Pocket” gundam. Only 6 episodes. 

Most “universal century” gundam series are confusing, with weird names for characters, and a lot of it can be hard to keep track of. 

But not War in the Pocket.
It’s a lovely story. And if it’s still not your cup of tea after episode 1, no worries! Don’t force yourself just because others enjoy it. You probably already have things you enjoy anyway.

(Hopefully that one is on steaming. But you might also just be able to rent it)"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"That's because despite the love, the old show is actually boring as hell, like an old episode of speed racer.  Try gundam unicorn."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Honestly, the simple omission of the G-fighter, G-bull, etc is enough on its own to make the movies vastly superior to the show."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Lucas stole the idea for light sabers from pulp science fiction stories from the the nineteen teens and movie serials from the thirties and forties. Hell the word ""Jedi"" is a bastardization of the term used in Japan for samurai films."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,The soundtrack is also streaming on Spotify!
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"The soundtrack is so kitschy and I absolutely love it. My favourite track has got to be [From Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoKkeTmYp4&list=PLE234F313FF53A39C&index=3), especially from 1:16 onward.

EDIT: And how can I forget the incredibly funky [Combat Airspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eszG8ww2GlQ&list=PLx9EEzTlMf5kEWPUK_a-q8OuVmHvf7ts5&index=5)!"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,[I also love that it](https://youtu.be/_lOeFQvA-uM) [got a cover album by Andrew W. K. of all people.](https://youtu.be/zILVdHewOZ8)
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"To be fair, OG Gundam created most of the tropes that have become the standard for long form war anime series. The price of being a genre defining game changer."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Still, I advise everyone to watch the updated theatrical(1-3) or read the modernized series(the origin) instead. 

They are far more organized and accessible."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Already is and on HBO Max
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I checked it out, it's not anything new just a little less blurry."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"You know what got me? I rewatched it and Bright is the only survivor of the original crew, he was a military cadet in training. He was 19 years old. Not even an Ensign rank. And he was supposed to not only captain the most advanced ship in the fleet, but wrangle a bunch of literal kids. He is basically doing a Battlestar Galactica. I feel for him this time around. I watch the show in abject horror at like 25 as all the people dying except like Ramba Ral were 6 or 9 years younger than me.
Lalah Sunn was a genius bit of writing too if you watch further in the shows."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Turns out when you do stories with a lot of depressing themes and death, you probably have depression."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"""Shut up and get in the Gundam, Amuro.""

Bright Noa is basically Gendo Ikari."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,It’s like Evangelion if Evangelion was even slightly comprehensible.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"Victory and Zeta had very dark moments, ZZ for the first half was slapstick and hammy but fans are rewarded once the theme song changes"
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,">Zambot 3

Thanks I'll definitely give it a watch. The reason I specified ""one of the most influential"" instead of the first or the beginning was exactly for shows like zambot and giant robot animes that came before it. 

I think Mobile suit specifically was like a big breaking point or milestone in the entire history of mecha anime. I remember hearing stories that when it's film premiered in cinemas they literally couldn't fit all the people who came to see it in the theatre because tomino apparently had a big announcement. They didn't expect it's popularity to be so wild. There are people who apparently recorded entire episodes of the show onto casette tapes just to listen on their walkmen and casette players. 

The vinyl was released and THAT became a best seller. 

tl;dr it was a huge fucking show."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"They did that in the Bandai Visual release, so I'm not sure exactly what the deal is."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"I’m just referencing a meme from r/Gundam.

Someone did the math and it’s two or three days short of one year."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Seed was more a remake of Wing IMO and Wing was a super-condensed remake of MSG+Zeta+CCA.
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Yeah Seed was probably the worst regarding this. Still enjoyed it though
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"To elaborate, the original show was hampered by a combination of factors. The show was required by it's sponsors and producers to have a robot fight in every episode. The producers and sponsors meddled with the show constantly, forcing the creative staff to add designs to the show that only existed to make toys (most notably the G fighter or as Tomino called it, the coffin the series would be buried in) and forced them to make kid friendly episodes that broke with the rest of the narrative of the show. In addition, the show's run was cut from 52 episodes to 43. Also the main animator Yoshikazu Yasuhiko suffered from a severe medical crisis during the production of the show and was hospitalized about halfway through the run until the show's completion.

As a result of these limitations, major parts of the story such as the origins of Char Aznable and Sala Mass were cut for time as well as a planned flashback episode which would have explained much of the backstory to the runup to the one year war. The origin comic sought to remedy these issues as well as give the designs and tone a facelift to match the modern incarnations of the Universal Century. I'd highly recommend reading it. Yoshikazu Yasuhiko is an astonishingly talented artist and storyteller.  Not only are the drawings amazing, but the panel layouts, pacing, transitions and expressions are absolutely top notch. Unfortunately the vast majority of Yaz's comics have not been translated into English so the origin is one of only two comics he drew that you can get that isn't in Japanese."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,Thanks!
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"G Gundam is absolutely hilarious. A martial arts tournament in giant ass robots, with all the characters and their respective nations being *hella* stereotyped. Funny as fuck. I mean, just look at [Master Asia's introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Fdj3pVW6w) here."
Mobile Suit Gundam Seed,"You’re forgetting the third type of series, build fighters, where kids build and battle figures based on the shows."

God Eater,Never heard of that website
God Eater,"Hot Take:

Coach Bombay was a shit coach that skated by on the talent of a handful of key players. When tasked with recruiting a new junior team USA, he shows his blatant favoritism and picks the same kids he's coached before. Then during the tournament, he breaks what I'm assuming is an ethical code by dating another teams coach and challenging another coach to a 1v1 with both teams in attendance, resulting in injury. He makes roster changes on the fly, coaches risky or flat out dangerous techniques, and encourages his players rebellious behaviors."

What kind of nonsense  seeding/bracket is this? The Ducks are the 8 seed,  and the Hawks are  the 1 seed, this is made very clear. In every  universe, they would play  in the first round, not the finals. The Hawks should have been mad  about their artificially challenging bracket.

God Eater,"So anyways, I was standing there waiting to use the pay phone. And this guy who was on the phone, turns around and tips his hat like thiiiis. And who do you think that guy was? Emilio Estevez. The Mighty Duck man, I swear to God, I was there. I was like, EMILLIIIIOOOOOOOOO"
God Eater,I’m 1000% in.
God Eater,BASH BROTHERS!
God Eater,Quack quack quack Quack QUACK! Mr. Ducksworth
God Eater,Possibly the greatest sports trilogy of all time
God Eater,"For anyone needing a youth hockey fix try to find this gem.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tournament_(TV_series)

Fairly absurd show about a crazy hockey dad."
God Eater,I needed some good news today. Thank you.
God Eater,"Great, now I have to get a Disney+ account.  You win again, Disney.  Ya fucks."
God Eater,QUACK QUACK QUACK QUACK MR. DUCKSWORTH!!
God Eater,Just watched Men at Work...quality.
God Eater,"So is he a recovering alcoholic or sad burnout has-been who gets one last chance to redeem himself by coaching another hockey team one last time? ""This ain't living. I'm just waiting to die! GO DUCKS!"""
God Eater,"FYI, you can get a [replica jersey for $30 on Amazon. ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KQYT84M). It's pretty good quality but my family hates it because of how smug I get when people say they love it. It's about kids jersey quality but fully embroiderd."
God Eater,flying V formation boys.
God Eater,Best news all year
God Eater,I hope it’s well done. Seems like a nostalgia cheap shot. Or a nostalgia knuckle puck?
God Eater,All companies play on our sense of nostalgia but goddamn it's working
God Eater,quack... quack... quack...
God Eater,"I wonder who’s gonna play Han-

Oh wait, too soon."
God Eater,Quack quack quack quack quack

God Eater,Should call him Gordon Mumbai in the reboot.
God Eater,The quack attack is back Jack!
God Eater,Give me ‘Men at Work 2’. Then I shall get excited.
God Eater,"I have often thought about another Mighty Ducks movie, starring all of the original cast, about these guys being in their forties and joining a park and rec hockey league. Directed by Judd Apatow."
God Eater,No Jussie Smollet return tho
God Eater,"[This scene ](https://youtu.be/J18UuMOybik)in D2 where they get the crew back together covers roughly 30 miles in real life on rollerblades. Not at all related to the story, just wanted to bring that up."
God Eater,EMILIOOOO!!!!!
God Eater,This is what I need in life. Been waiting 20 years.
God Eater,“Goldberg” was just arrested in in the pop hole that is “yc” for burglary on the same day😒
God Eater,[deleted]
God Eater,QUACK
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I think it's so interesting that there are shows about topics that are so mundane. Especially considering how complicated some television shows are.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Mundane shows are the best!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHd6h1y_xyM (context: shes an angel studying humans on earth)"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Grest show!   FYI - Directed by Peter Berg.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Here's the trailer from Showtime:

- https://youtu.be/wyJygZIofc8"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Man, I'm watching now. It's very well made."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"""Adulting"""
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
Daily Lives of High School Boys,as a nonactor me too.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
Daily Lives of High School Boys,This whole sub has just become ads lol
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Drake Bell doesn't care for an adult version.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,You forgot *Hey Dude*
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Definitely ready for that word to die.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,yippee yippee yeehaw!!!
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"And they always mean incredibly basic things like doing laundry and paying bills. Never the tough things like fighting with the insurance company to cover cancer treatment, trying to get speech therapy for your kid, or caring for a disabled parent."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I’m glad someone said it.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Coconut Head?
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Who?
Daily Lives of High School Boys,posting this and not saying the name?
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,The Internet is ads
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Always was
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Well, what else is there to do here ?

I prefer those ads over people bootlicking Netflix execs."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,This is a podcast about adult life not a rewatch podcast but agreed
Daily Lives of High School Boys,The short lived Aliens in America too.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,She also made one of my favorite games of all time: Enslaved. Great part alongside Andy Serkins.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,She was also in Suburgatory for a few episodes
Daily Lives of High School Boys,She also did a great performance as Trip in the video game Enslaved. Did motion capture for it and everything.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,She had a role in the Twilight movies as well.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Such a shame. It feels like a no brainer for new content, but I guess Nick doesn't feel the same way."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Something about it just grinds my gears. It's like internet speak to me, I'd react the same way if someone actually said LOL in real life."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Wish I Was Here was a solid movie, but I don't know why I needed to fund it."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"This is where the minor celebrity comes in. If he can come up with a pitchable product like a movie, he can try doing a Kickstarter and use his fame to promote the Kickstarter."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,100%...i need to binge this show eventually. I'm currently watching 3 long as shows right now though...
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"The internet is for ads  
The Internet is for ads  
Why’d you think the Net was had?  
Ads, ads, ads"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Am..I an ad???
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Lmao what do you mean ""she made?"" She isn't a game dev lol"
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I really don’t understand why not. Just put it on Paramount+. The iCarly reboot seemed to get a decent amount of buzz.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,To me it's the idea that being an adult is like being at a job. Something that's inconvenient but you have to do it to live. No you are an adult 24/7 start acting like it
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"Yeah, but even that's a stretch. 

Devon hasn't acted in much of anything in years, so having a crowd-funded project would be much harder for him than it was for Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,ok work avenue q
Daily Lives of High School Boys,">	Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels.

God, I’m so excited about that kickstarter. I backed at the highest tier and am waiting on my first delivery."
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I'm not convinced that Sanderson is actually human. I'm pretty sure that he--and John Ringo for that matter--are robots who write and do not sleep.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Adrian Tchaikovsky too.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,I always thought it was funny that backwards ass Pawnee had a thriving gay bar.
Daily Lives of High School Boys,Greetings from The Snakehole Lounge!
Daily Lives of High School Boys,"In my small town young people hung out at the Waffle House or just in grocery store parking lots because the bars all had a gross, older alcoholics vibe."
Tiger and Bunny,Anime is television. I don’t know why people who don’t like the stuff downvote posts about it.
Tiger and Bunny,"I was just thinking about this show the other day! Can’t really remember what happened in the first season, just that it was surprisingly fun. Glad to see they’re doing a second series!"
Tiger and Bunny,"This is one of my favorite anime, I had completely given hope on a season 2 since the first season came out like a decade ago. This made my day!"
Tiger and Bunny,AAAAAA This is the best Christmas present. My favorite show returns!
Tiger and Bunny,Devil is a part timer is coming back too. Two of the first anime I chose to watch as a kid.
Tiger and Bunny,Releasing on my birthday wow
Tiger and Bunny,"This brings back so many memories. It feels like forever ago, since I watched this anime. It's good to see it getting the second season it deserves."
Tiger and Bunny,Yo. Isn't his hundred power down to only 45 seconds or 2 minutes or something? Thought he retired.
Tiger and Bunny,"At first glance, I thought this was another Tiger King show/spin-off"
Tiger and Bunny,Dust bunnies like those little guys from Spirited Away?
Tiger and Bunny,"Oh, cool."
Tiger and Bunny,For anyone getting too excited… it’s a 3 minute short.
Tiger and Bunny,[deleted]
Tiger and Bunny,Music by good old Ludde. It’s really cool to see how well he’s been doing lately.
Tiger and Bunny,Sounds cute. Looking forward to it.
Tiger and Bunny,Hope this leads to more collaboration. Visions was one of my favorite star wars things in a while since it just let people take the core concepts of star wars and do their own things with them. Would love to see what ghibli would do
Tiger and Bunny,an intro to animation 101 final project
Tiger and Bunny,"Very short and frankly, very simple. It should get released on YT as Mandalorian promo, not behind paywall."
Tiger and Bunny,"I don't what this is, but.. Grogu.  So, ok.."
Tiger and Bunny,"You know what? This seems like the perfect matchup. I'm sold. Spirited Away is the only Ghibli film I've seen, but it's one of my faves of all time. And I'll always be biased towards Grogu because he was my grandmother's favorite thing in the world. I'll watch it."
Tiger and Bunny,Just watched it. Yep. That was an animated short
Tiger and Bunny,Soot sprites*
Tiger and Bunny,"Meh, it was alright. Not really worth making a deal of it."
Tiger and Bunny,They are Soot Sprites.
Tiger and Bunny,My Neighbor Groguro
Tiger and Bunny,"Oh god.

They’ve finally done it. 


They got so obsessed with wondering if they could, they didn’t think about if they should!

They’ve incorporated myasaki films into the Disney Multiverse!"
Tiger and Bunny,Might as well start drawing Pepsi commercials. Sad
Tiger and Bunny,[deleted]
Tiger and Bunny,Grogu is and will always be a dumb name
Tiger and Bunny,I really hope Hayao Miyazaki is directly involved. The movies that Miyazaki's son Goro has been making under the Ghibli banner have been painfully subpar and lacking in that trademark magic.
Tiger and Bunny,"I don't care much for Star Wars or The Mandalorian, so I'm not in a rush to watch this. I'm not subscribing to Disney+ just for a short lol"
Tiger and Bunny,Nooo
Tiger and Bunny,As a Canadian I won't be able to watch it. https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/freeland-tip-costs-cutting-disney-twitter
Tiger and Bunny,r/oldotaku wpuld love this
Tiger and Bunny,That’s what y’all callin it huh?…
Tiger and Bunny,Pikayodachu
Tiger and Bunny,"I’ve been on a Miyazaki marathon, and this is perfect"
Tiger and Bunny,It was... disappointing.
Tiger and Bunny,Looks like one guys side project. Very simple in it’s scope. Cute though.
Tiger and Bunny,Any link to download?
Tiger and Bunny,Dust bunnies?! Those are soot sprites!
Tiger and Bunny,My neighbour Totoro
Tiger and Bunny,in conjunction with Studio Ghibli!
Tiger and Bunny,3 minutes of studio ghibli anything is like drugs. mixed with star wars and it might as well be fentanyl
Tiger and Bunny,Including credits
Tiger and Bunny,Better than zero minutes
Tiger and Bunny,I got downvoted to oblivion for expressing I wished for a longer project.
Tiger and Bunny,Wow that’s a whole two minutes shorter than I predicted of it being a 5 minute short 😂
Tiger and Bunny,"And studio ghibli, this is next level. Can’t wait!"
Tiger and Bunny,Don’t be surprised if you get into Studio Ghibli after this.
Tiger and Bunny,"whaaaat? please watch more. princess mononoke, castle in the sky, my neighbor totoro, and so many others. the crown jewels of all anime"
Tiger and Bunny,You'd like the cat returns. Cute flick
Tiger and Bunny,"Yup, very that."
Tiger and Bunny,Kamajii begs to differ
Tiger and Bunny,I felt like I'd seen it before.
Tiger and Bunny,Depends on the translation.
Tiger and Bunny,Almost all of their works are adaptations and they.have worked with Disney in the past. How is this different?
Tiger and Bunny,Seems like a good fit to me.
Tiger and Bunny,"Star Wars always had bizarre names with the odd real world name mixed in.  Its part of the charm. Like think about it, we have guys called Boba, Din, Fenn, Obi-Wan, Ki-adi-mundi, Kit Fisto, Lando, etc."
Tiger and Bunny,"You can probably sit this one out, tbh."
Tiger and Bunny,"man, I don't envy Goro. Insane pressure on following his legendary father's steps, who then scolded him hard for his first movie. Can't imagine how he must have felt"
Tiger and Bunny,"Ronja, the Robber's Daughter is by him and is absolutely amazing"
Tiger and Bunny,They're in both films. Susuwatari or soot sprites.
Tiger and Bunny,Eh. LucasFilms is the baby powder in my 100% pure Ghibli cocaine.
Tiger and Bunny,Studio Ghibli is max level.
Tiger and Bunny,"Gee can’t wait for more Jedi/Sith, lightsaber nonsense…"
Tiger and Bunny,I was expecting a show or movie? It’s 3 minutes. A fun 3 minutes I guess. Added to my LSD watchlist
Tiger and Bunny,I hate to call it anime even because it's unlike the mainstream anime that I see elsewhere which lacks subtlety and is over the top and boorish to boot.
Tiger and Bunny,"The Cat Returns doesn't get enough credit, but basically that's how it is for any non-Miyazaki movie."
Tiger and Bunny,"Idk, star wars has always been primarily about selling toys. That was George Lucas' plan from day one, merchandising. Ghilbi has always seemed better than that to me."
Tiger and Bunny,"All I’m saying is that as a big Ghibli fan and a huge SW fan, I was hoping for a bigger project. At least a Visions episode (which I suppose is still a possibility). A Grogu short is okay, I guess. I’m going to watch it today, I’m sure it’s really cute."
Tiger and Bunny,"So... I'm a language guy, but I want to drop some fun little knowledge.

The phonetics of Star Wars is rooted in modern language phonetics, but not English phonetics, so when you take Gro and gu and smush them together it sounds more awkward than say Yo and Da, both of which have very common real world phonetics, Da is Russian, while Yo is distinctly Japanese, as in Yo-kai. 

So you are both correct."
Tiger and Bunny,Dont forget Jedi Master Soon Bayts
Tiger and Bunny,"""Move it ya stupid soot balls!"""
Tiger and Bunny,Oh Ive clearly completely forgot where they were in spirited away. Time for a rewatch :)
Tiger and Bunny,But never “dust bunnies.”
Tiger and Bunny,"If only there was a stellar Star Wars show on right now with no Jedi, Sith, or lightsabers."
Tiger and Bunny,"Shit, any Studio Ghibli movie would be a crazy LSD watchlist add. Princess Mononoke is my recommendation."
Tiger and Bunny,"?? it's legit anime. literally translates to 'animation' as produced by Japanese culture - the soulless flashy mindless fluff is what sucks, but doesn't give 'animation' a bad name, just their studios"
Tiger and Bunny,His son made that one in particular
Tiger and Bunny,Never a bad time for a spirited away rewatch! the soot sprites were always my favorites haha. perfect amount of comedy to give u a short laughing/heartwarming break from sad or scary moments in the film
Tiger and Bunny,"He recycled a lot of his creatures. The cat-thing in Nausica was in a couple of others, I just can’t remember which one. I want to say Castle in the Sky?"
Tiger and Bunny,Hmmmmmm what could you possibly be referring to?
Tiger and Bunny,"I didn't say it wasn't, but it goes like this ""hey my friends, you need to watch miyazaki's films because they are great films,"" to which my friends reply ""I don't like anime."" And nothing I say can change that, I don't blame them because most of what passes for anime is rubbish, and Studio Ghibli's films are nothing like them at least none that I've seen."
Tiger and Bunny,"Like minions, until they made the shows about the minions, and then it was too much... Uh oh."
Tiger and Bunny,"yes, crawling over the robots 💕"
Tiger and Bunny,[deleted]
Tiger and Bunny,My friends are the exact opposite. They won’t let themselves consider studio ghibli films anime simply BECAUSE they enjoy them. But yeah they refuse to watch any other anime.
Tiger and Bunny,Mandorlorian?
Tiger and Bunny,Andor
Tiger and Bunny,I watched the first five episodes and was bored to tears.
Tiger and Bunny,Mandor?
Tiger and Bunny,The best part of the documentary is how clearly you could see each of the three central malicious morons thinking they were controlling the narrative with their camera time.
Tiger and Bunny,The fact that people aren't more upset about that weird dude's sex cult or the rampant animal abuse worries me.
Tiger and Bunny,The general public can't be trusted with people's personal information. SHOCKER...
Tiger and Bunny,"Carole Baskin allegedly (major emphasis on allegedly) may have played a role in her husbands disappearance, and the internet loses their mind.

Joe Exotic literally plies his husbands with meth, doesn't allow them to work or leave until one of them dies and then proceeds to make the funeral about himself, and everyone is out there asking for him to be pardoned.

Meanwhile doc antle is literally running a cult with slaves, and Jeff is a piece of shit conman.

And the worse thing is that Carole is right. In the middle of all this personal drama, you learn very little about how the tigers are actually being treated, with the exception of doc antle killing his tigers and joe exotics mass fuck ups. The documentary implies that she mistreats her tigers because she feeds them through cages, but when you get an aerial view of the zoo it's a huge piece of land that's fully available for12 tigers to roam through. Not to mention multiple accounts of people who visited the zoo and who expressed that big cat rescue was misrepresented in the show."
Tiger and Bunny,[deleted]
Tiger and Bunny,"All I took from this series was that big cat people are terrible, crazy lunatics and you can't trust ANY of them."
Tiger and Bunny,"So this is the takeaway? Not the narcissistic, gross, white haired dude grooming teenage girls to be his wife's like the pedo piece of shit he is.

Did nobody notice that? Because that was seriously more fucked up than anything else on the show."
Tiger and Bunny,It did piss me off that they didn’t seem to focus on animal cruelty at all. They did gloss over it and in passing talked  about it and it sickened me to see him drag that poor mins old cub away from its mom and pull it through the fence while she was still giving birth. You don’t even separate puppies from  their moms that early before selling.I was disappointed that the fact that he clearly wasn’t taken care of his cats correctly was just a non issue it seems even though the doc started off as if they did care. And Doc Antle needs his own doc cuz Jesus he’s insane. Joe was interesting but clearly a shit human. Everyone who worked for him hates him now for a reason but no one seems to care about that for some reason. He barely showed emotion when his employee was still bleeding out on his property. And barely cared when his own husband died. This reminds me of when chicks were hot to Ted Bundy. People are stupid like that lol
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I don't suppose you could add a brief few sentences/words selling us on the series and why they're worth a watch and what makes them special? To me, I just see a laundry list of titles and genres honestly. 

Knowing the animation studio and year released is pretty much meaningless for knowing the quality of character development and plot depth."

Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I think you can also add Megalo Box to this list. While the ending wasn't as good, rest of the show was still great, and might actually suit most of the audience here. The old school animation and design, etc. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste. Most of these will not be appealing for the general audience. 

Some good animes for the Western Taste (2010s only):

One-Punch Man (Action/Comedy. An overpowered dude that is a hero for fun).


My Hero Academica (Action/Coming of Age story. A weak powerless boy gets the most powerful superpower in the world and his tale to master this power without breaking everything in his body using it.)


Psycho Pass (Thriller/Crime. Dystopian Future where police kills everyone who has a hint of mental instability)

Parasyte (Thriller/Horror. Dude gets infected by an alien parasite but the infection doesn't go as planned.)

Edit: Forgot to add that these all have English Dubs. Most of the list above do not.
"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Gundam: Iron Blooded Orphans
Is a great one, its serious, the animation looks great, it does get dark because it deals with children piloting the mechs"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"First, thank you putting this list together and trying to offer more exposure to an entire medium/format/genre (Japanese animation) that is, imo, underappreciated in the west. Now, on to a few thoughts/opinions:

When people actually ask for recommendations, it's best not to overwhelm them with options else they might feel overwhelmed and give up. If they get a response of ""Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Death Note"" then they already have ~100 hours of watching ahead of them and those are totally fine options. 

There's a lot of comedy and slice of life on this list. While more variety sounds better on paper, I don't think those genres work as well as others with a language/culture barrier. They're usually more character focused and thus body language, dialog, inflection, dialect, translation, nuance, delivery, inside jokes, locality, animation style, etc. become more important. The usual Cowboy Bebop recommendations are generally more serious, conceptual, sci-fi, psychological, seinen, action, mystery -type series that show off what ""adult"" animation is capable of which result in more ""wow!"" experiences (and western media ""borrowing"" from them). The unfortunate ""anime stigma"" in the west is that anime is perverted and characters look/act like 12yo children (which westerners already have in the form of youth-targeted cartoons). So, while I personally really enjoy something like Kill La Kill, I don't think the over-the-top action, ridiculous plot, and easily misinterpreted sexualization would be a good starting point/leave a good first impression for the uninitiated. 

This list is great for those who have already watched most of the popular recommendations for westerners and want to branch out a bit more. That said, new fans should keep in mind that they'll probably dislike 95% of all anime produced. I've watched 300+ series and I wouldn't go anywhere near some of the stuff on this list. And that's OK; it's common with most hobbies/interests. Find what you like, look for more, have fun with it, share your experiences!

For reference, my favorite TV (top 10, random order):

* Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul
* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Black Mirror
* Lost
* The Wire
* Battlestar Galactica
* Utopia
* It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia
* Mr. Robot

My favorite anime (top 10, random order):

* Ghost in the Shell
* Ergo Proxy
* Evangelion
* Black Lagoon
* Cowboy Bebop
* Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann
* Full Metal Alchemist
* Steins;Gate
* Psycho-Pass
* Fate/Zero /Stay Night (UBW)"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I was kinda hoping you would list [Uchuu Kyoudai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/12431/Uchuu_Kyoudai ) or Space Brothers in English.  Pretty good slice of life/sci fi about becoming an Astronaut.   Here is the [trailer with English sub for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciS3fDqT1Vw )

Another series maybe not considered in the past decade is [Hajime No Ippo](https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo ) even though the 3rd season (Hajime No Ippo: Rising) came out in 2013/2014.  Its a great sport/slice of life/comedy series."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Needs more Jojo
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"i like cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, FMA, samurai champloo

basically anime that does not rely on anime troupes and tells a great story, what would you recommend from this decade?

edit: action oriented is a plus"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I'd like to throw a shout for Terror in Resonance too. Great show
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Barakamon and Girls' Last Tour are two of my absolute favorite shows, and I'm pretty happy to see them make the list. Sora no Woto is up there too.

Those three are all slice-of-life type shows, a genre that can be pretty hit or miss, but these three do a great job of building a world (or a town, as in Barakamon) and making you keep watching because you're interested in that world, and the characters, even if there's no overreaching plot trying to tie everything together. They aren't necessarily exciting, but they're thoroughly enjoyable. And sometimes you just need a nice calm show like that."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Kind of a weird post. I'd expect at least a sorry description with each show. A genre doesn't really cut it.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"**Sora no Woto** is surprisingly good. Definitely not what I expected. It's part slice of life, part post-apocalypse, and also an anti-war story. And the music is fantastic. Occasionally feels like **Kino's Journey**, but somwhat less bleak. 

***
**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu** is a slow burn, but is an exceptionally good period drama set in the post-postwar era where the Japanese economy was beginning to pick up again. One of the popular forms of entertainment was a style of traditonal comic storytelling called Rakugo. In an era where not many had televisions yet, they were often broadcast on radio. 

A recently released convict approaches one of the masters of this artform to become his disciple after having only heard his radio broadcasts in prison. Drama ensues. Lots of dialogue as you may expect. **Joshiraku** is a much less serious take on Rakugo, if you like terrible puns and Japanese cultural references you won't understand, this is for you. 

***
**Natsume's Book of Friends** is really one of the most heartbreaking yet heartwarming series I've ever seen. Main character is the only person who can see the denizens of the spirit world, resulting in him being ostracised by almost every human he meets due to his reaction to heir presence, but returning to his grandmother's hometown changes that, for better or worse. Partly episodic, but with some overarching plot. For another contemporary fantasy series that's kind of similar, try **The Ancient Magus' Bride**. **Mushishi** is also excellent and has a similar spirit detective vibe, but much more serious. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Didn't see Steins Gate on here..... Better than 90% 0f the things listed 
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"My Hero Academia and Assassination Classroom are noticeably not present :o  
I personally fuckin loved AC, I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I found it wholesome and touching"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Madoka magica ! 
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I’m not a huge anime fan. But I watched Erased recently... good lord that’s a fantastic show. Cool plot, good characters, good mystery. Plays on a fantasy I think a lot of people have at least once in their life. And there’s only one season. They got in, told their story, and got out."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Thank you so much, OP, for this! I haven't watched much of anime since my college days, and I have lost track of what's what. Thank you for the recommendations, definitely going to save this post."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"You're Lie In April, imo, is also a must watch."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Awh no your lie about in April

"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Thank you for making this. I have a hard time keeping up with all the awesome anime coming out. I can barely keep up with all the western shows that are out. Just finishing up breaking bad.

I can recommend darling in the franxx."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"If you are looking for slow burn anime's that don't have your typical Japanese pervy tropes, watch Mushishi and Monster. Masterpieces imo."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Blood Blockade Battlefront, Mob Psycho, and Made in Abyss are all in my top 10 anime. Very solid shows. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"What do you guys recommend as good mindfuck mystery type ones?

in the vein of Mirrai Nikki, Madoka Magica, Shinsekai yori"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"My anime background is just the classics and most well known (DragonBall, Naruto, Bleach). Right now my only base for anime is Netflix. I've watched Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Sinbad, Death Note and One Punch Man, and currently I started watching Sword Art Online. 

Do you recommend it? Based on my viewing history and the Netflix catalogue what would you recommend I watch next?"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I would say you’re missing Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure. Besides being awesome it’s a cultural touchstone in Anime that is constantly referenced and parodied. I would argue it’s a must watch show
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"\>K-On!  


My. Fucking. Man. The best taste."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Devilman crybaby is also a good anime, gory , but good."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Add in wotakoi: love is hard for an otaku. It's a really good romance comedy that deals with adults instead of the regular HS ones
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,No love for Welcome to the N.H.K.?
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I'm someone who haven't watched a lot of anime since about 2008 or so, so I'll check out some of these, thanks. 

That said, I feel like the medium has definitely changed a lot since that time. So many shows now have either very strange animation styles (Kill la Kill, Made in Abyss, Devilman Crybaby...) or these strange formulaic stock characters everywhere (at least I don't remember people talking about tsunderes and moes and I don't know what back in the day). I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff once you get past these things, but in most cases nowadays I don't get further than some weirdass synopsis before I sigh and re-watch Black Lagoon or Claymore instead. And I'm someone who, despite not immersing myself into the anime/""weabo"" culture, has after all read and watched quite a lot of manga and anime in my time, and someone who likes 'weird' stuff Evangelion or Gantz.

I think that's the reason why Attack on Titan has been such a hit here in the West, despite imho not being that good of a show (it seems to go for repeated 'shocks' over telling an engaging story). It has a pretty 'realistic' and good looking animation style, characters that for the most part look rather normal, and though the premise is a bit strange it's very straight-forward once it gets going."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Recently saw Made in Abyss because a lot of people have been raving about it.

The main characters are a girl of 14, and a robot that looks like a boy of about the same age.

I would like it a lot more, if there were not shit like recurring ""jokes"" where people look down the robot boys pants and exclaim that he has a penis. 

Like often when people were recommending it, I'd see em specify that it was not for children, and I kinda assumed that was because of horror elements or something. Like god dammit Japan."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Ummm...My Hero Academia?

It's an amazing shonen series with much better pacing, animation and characters than a lot of its contemporaries."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Another one I’d absolutely recommend if you’re looking for a more light hearted/comedic take on anime is “The Devil is a Part Timer”. 

Really funny, great story and quick watch. Premise is pretty simple, Devil comes back to earth and tries to take over the world...by working in fast food. 

If I’m not mistaken it’s still on Netflix, highly highly recommend."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Parastye -the maxim- should 100% be on this list. 
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I'm gonna use this thread to mention that, yes, One Piece has over 800 episodes, but it is probably the most pure fun that you can find while still managing to be epic, emotional and engaging. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Your lie in april. 

Shokugeki no soma 

Nanatsu no taizai"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I'll martyr myself and list Tokyo Ghoul. I guess it's become pretty 'normie' but i still really enjoyed it. Also The Lost Village was a pretty neat short one.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I recognized so few animes in that list. Feel like you're missing a TON.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Damn. When you realize all of the super popular anime you liked as a kid aren’t part of this decade lol 

Old. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Does crunchyroll or funimation offer offline/download & play yet? That's been my biggest obstacle to consuming anime.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Black Clover?
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I would recommend Made in Abyss. Only one season and it's already one of my favorites.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Beast Player Erin (Kemono no Sōja) is a really good one that I never hear anyone mention.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Pretty good list, though I'd add Higurashi (the official stuff, essentially seasons 1 and 2.) for how damn good it was it combining the slice of life with horror, especially the more psychological aspects. Umineko is different, but good just somewhat odd at times and feels better to read than merely watch. 
"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Baki 2018. Absolutely brutal fighting. If you are squeamish do not watch. It is metal as hell though, I love it.


I could probably recommend some others but I'll leave it at that."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,[deleted]
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Don't forget to request to get new seasons of your favorite anime:

https://help.netflix.com/en/titlerequest"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I've only ever watched one anime in my adult life and that's Attack on Titan. I really enjoyed it but I'm fine not watching anything else. I have some personal hang ups about anime being ""for kids"", even the one tailored for mature audiences. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Not only are these shows that fall out of the ""Same 10 anime"" thing. They're all shows that I can see actually getting people into anime. Shows like FMA:B and Death Note are shows that feel detached enough for people to think ""I'm not too sure about anime, but Fullmetal Alchemist is pretty good"" instead of ""hey maybe I like anime"". All of these shows (at least the ones I've seen) are both great and feel like anime. Good list.


I also want to boost March Comes in Like a Lion to anyone reading this. It's one of my favorite shows. It follows a 17 year old depressed professional Shogi player who just recently started living on his own. Over the course of the series you watch him open up to people and form a familiar relationship that he's never really had in his life. You don't need to know anything about Shogi to understand the show."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I'd like to think that Shouwa Genjou Rakugo Shinju is the pinnacle of anime in recent years. THE series that towers above the rest. It's not my favourite series for sure, but it comes incredibly close to perfection in so many ways. I doubt I'd recommend it to someone new to anime, but there's no excuse for anyone who calls themselves an avid fan of anime to not watch Rakugo. 

And then there's Ping Pong... The things I would give to see another series of this caliber. I'm so glad to see it on your list."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,All are pretty good except Yuru Camp and Flip Flappers
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is probably the first new-ish anime I've fully watched in years, since Bodacious Space Pirates and Jormungand. It's poignant, cute, a little... creepy... but still heartily recommended."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"I was never an Anime fan.  I remember enjoying Ninja Scroll back in the 90's, but that's about it.  Then one day 'Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress' popped up on Amazon Prime, and I clicked on it, because there was nothing else to watch.  Loved it.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to see even more.  Attack on Titan was a recommendation I've heard over and over, so I started watching it next.  It was even better than the Iron Fortress.  The animation, the soundtrack, the story - they were all just perfect, and I couldn't wait for more.

While waiting for the next season, I was eager to see all the other great anime shows I've been missing out on.  But here's where the disappointment came.  I would check dozens of the top recommended shows, and they simply weren't my cup of tea.  Either the animation was looking like something made in the 80's, or the story was just meh.  I could barely watch one episode, before giving up in the search of the next Attack on Titan. 

It all made sense, when I found out both Attack on Titan, and Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress are made by the same studio.  I have yet to find any other anime show that comes close to those two.  And this is not me shitting on other shows.  I'm sure they're great, but they just don't do it for me.  There's just something about AoT or KotIF, whether it's the awesome visuals, or soundtrack, that put them in a league of their own."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"No sword art online season 1?

What's the point?


Jk (though I do like SAO)

Great list op thanks for sharing"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Maybe doesn't *technically* count, but 48% of Gintama (and potentially more, maybe, hopefully) has come after your cutoff date, and imo Gintama is a legendary anime. Action/comedy, has survived multiple hiatuses, and has reportedly been more profitable than Bleach or Naruto in Western countries, made even more incredible due to its lack of an English dub or mainstream viewing channel (such as Cartoon Network's Toonami). Insane amounts of fun, and I'm incredibly sad to be seeing it go."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,[deleted]
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Totally expected, but still dissapointed that there's no Yu-Gi-Oh. :p  
Just fits well with my personal taste.  
  
My favorite beyond that though is the old anime Ranma ½. Although the manga has better plots and characterization, love the animation, voices and music. :D"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Look at you making a worthless list that doesn't include whether there is a dub, which makes it awful, and by extension you awful."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Oh! I can do a brief rundown of all of them. Give me a few minutes and I'll be back with a few words about each.  


EDIT: OKAY! Here we go.

**Barakamon:** brash young calligrapher gets exiled to the boonies to find himself

**Blood Blockade Battlefront:** secret society of supers fight weird monsters in wacky New York

**Cells at Work:** Osmosis Jones but with a cute redhead as the lead instead of Chris Rock

**Chihayafuru:** Sports show about a poetry card game. Cooler than it sounds.

**Death Parade:** Bar in purgatory hosts games to judge souls’ fates

**The Eccentric Family:** An eccentric family of shapeshifters go about their lives

**Erased:** Time travel murder mystery where the time travel isn’t that big of a deal. Tearjerker.

**Flip Flappers:** I literally cannot describe it beyond “two magical girls and trippy world”

**Flying Witch:** Extremely relaxing show about a witch training in the countryside

**Girls’ Last Tour:** Two girls journey across a harsh post apocalyptic wasteland. Philosophy?

**Haikyuu:** Hot guys play volleyball. Character development.

**Hyouka:** Bored high schoolers solve boring mysteries. Show is anything but boring.

**K-On:** Cute high school girls play in a band and eat cake. Super comfy.

**Katanagatari:** Finding swords? Weird art style. Weirder dialogue.

**Kids on the Slope:** Realistic jazz coming of age in the 60s. Great music.

**Kill la Kill:** Skimpy lingerie battles at fascist high school. Way better than it sounds.

**Kyousogiga:** Similarly trippy, often confusing show about multidimensional family. Fantastic.

**Land of the Lustrous:** One of the few 3D CGI anime worth your time. About gem people, but not the Steven Universe kind.

**Little Witch Academia:** Harry Potter.

**Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions:** Cute middle schoolers do things? Haven’t seen it.

**Lupin III:** Classic, classy thief steals riches and hearts. Got Miyazaki his start.

**Made in Abyss:** Don’t go exploring the big scary hole, kids. Don’t.\\

**March comes in like a Lion:** Drama about a chess prodigy and his relationships. One of the best. 

**Mawaru Penguindrum:** Brothers and penguins(?) try to help their sister. Haven’t seen it.

**Miss Kobayashi:** Fun, funny show about a woman who adopts a bunch of dragon people into her life

**Mob Psycho 100:** Cool, trippy, great action show about a kid with super psychic powers

**Monthly Girls’ Nozaki Kun:** High school girl’s crush on romance manga artist goes unnoticed; she becomes his assistant in this wacky, hilarious comedy about romance.

**My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU:** Catcher in the Rye if it were anime and there were three Holdens. Very good.

**Mushishi:** Cool-ass spirit detective does spirit detective shit

**Nagi no Asukara:** Very pretty show about water people(?) Haven’t seen it.

**Natsume’s Book of Friends:** Arguably the closest you’ll get to a Ghibli TV show. Guy has spirit friends.

**Nichijou:** Wacky sketch comedy about wacky insane people. Very good.

**Noragami:** Haven’t seen it …. a fallen god is trying to get back on his feet(?)

**Ore Monogatari:** Gentle giant falls in love with pint sized classmate. Adorable as fuck.

**Ping Pong the Animation:** Guys play ping pong, learn about themselves. Looks wacky. Is fantastic.

**A Place Further than the Universe:** Girls go to Antarctica. Sweet and touching show.

**Polar Bear Cafe:** Polar bears and other animals run a cafe (?) Haven’t seen it.

**Shinsekai Yori:** WORLDBUILDING. New generation of humans trying to figure out about themselves(?)

**Shirobako:** An anime show about making anime shows. It’s incredible, heartwarming and educational.

**Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu:** Stand up comedy but it’s sit-down comedy and it’s very old fashioned. Character drama about artists in a dying medium in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and beyond. Slow burn that’s easily one of the best shows of the last few years, anime or no.

**So Ra No Wo To:** Girls in a small brigade run an army corps of musicians. Also they have a tank? There’s more to it but I can’t remember.

**Sound Euphonium:** High school concert band, and all the character drama and shenanigans that go with it. Very good.

**Space Dandy:** About a dandy guy in space. Lots of sexual humor. From the guy who made Cowboy Bebop. 

**Tamako Market:** Girl living in a market district has fun shenanigans with friends. Warm and comfy. The talking bird grows on you. Oh, also there’s a dark-skinned prince who shows up.

**Tanaka kun is Always Restless:** haven’t seen this one -- it’s about a guy who’s always lazy. But supposedly it’s very good.

**Tatami Galaxy:** Very fast dialogue, weird visuals. About a guy figuring out his life in college. Once you get the hang of it, it’s very entertaining and relatable.

**Tsuki ga Kirei:** Adorable show about middle schoolers’ first love.

**Tsuritama:** Haven’t seen it. IIRC there’s a guy who’s like a mermaid? Comedy, I think.

**Usagi Drop:** Relaxing, sweet show about a bachelor who takes in his grandfather’s six year old daughter from an affair. 

**Violet Evergarden:** Gorgeous show about PTSD and a young woman who becomes a letter writer in a semi 1930s world. Don’t go in expecting an action show. 

**Yona of the Dawn:** Semi-historical action adventure about a princess and her crew who go rogue.

**Yuru Camp:** Comfy show about high schoolers camping. Will make you want to camp."

Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Nichijou, Ping Pong the Animation, Sound! Euphonium, Kyousougiga, and A Place Further than the Universe are my next biggest recommendations.

Also, I actually almost didn't include Noragami, as I had some problems with the 1st season, but damn was Noragami Aragoto amazing. It's everything I love about battle shounen (a genre I'm not really a fan of) but without the filler. Too bad we'll never get a 3rd season."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Haha yeah i decided to use english names unless it's so uncommon. I've seen a fair amount of people online refer to kekkai sensen by the english name, so i went with that. In contrast, I've literally never heard anyone call Nagi no Asukara by the english name: A Lull in the Sea."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Agreed. One could make an argument that it's the anime equivalent to It's Always Sunny. 

Not me obvious, but someone else could."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Watched it but didn't find it quite as funny as others. Then again, I actually like Isekai as a genre (I know some dismiss it) and would probably have recommended Overlord at least. Honorable mentions to Re:Zero, Death March, and even Knights & Magic IMO though I know that last one is held up by many as an example of what is wrong with Isekai shows. "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"It's so popular I feel the OP decided it didn't need another shout out.

But yeah, it's a pretty good show."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"It just annoys me how none of the heroes ever die.

Kills the suspense everytime they battle these villains who are more experienced and powerful than them."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Watching that show only makes me pine for OPM that much more. 
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I feel it's just a copy of Naruto. 
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,How does it compare in tone/style etc to Hajime no Ippo? Definitely loving the idea of another boxing anime.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Oh right, I should get around to watching that."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Parasyte is really good, Imagine Japanese Peter Parker turned into venom before he ever became spider-man, and takes the responsibility to make sure to the best of his ability that humans and alien body snatchers are able to co exist secretly without everyone dying. 

"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I dunno those first two are the sort of over-recommended shows that the OP was trying to avoid. 
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"> Next time I would include Animes that would appeal to Western Taste

Baccano!"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Psycho Pass season one is AMAZING
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Pretty sure OP was going for non-generic picks.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"OPM, MHA and Psycho Pass are such cliche recommendations. They're good but defeat the whole purpose of this list. 

This whole ""Western Taste"" nonsense is so exaggerated "
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"-	imo One Punch Man wore its premise thin pretty quickly
-	I guess I kinda liked My Hero Academia, but that's about it.
-	Psycho Pass sits just right outside my list because of the disappointing 2nd season.
-	I have to give it to you for Parasyte tho. Great show that I somehow forgot while making this list. Not sure which one it would replace tho (probably Kill la Kill or Tanaka-kun is Always Listless)"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I'd throw in Berserk and Hunter x Hunter and then call it a day.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Do they get all emo and decide to defeat their enemies through power of love/friendship/telepathy/whatever?

Because I am watching Gundam Unicorn and it's abysmal. Especially since I watched Gundam 8th MS Team, Thunderbolt and Origins before this one and those seemed way superior even though Unicorn is supposed to be some hot stuff.

I mean, where did all that emo/telepathy stuff come from all of a sudden?  

"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"My taste overlaps with you quite a bit on live action. I couldn't get into Black Lagoon or Gurren Lagann, but I'll try to give Ergo Proxy, Steins;Gate, Psycho-Pass, and Ghost in the Shell a shot.

Thanks!"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,This show was hilarious
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,I will never forgive Gainax for what they did in the finale. God fucking damn it. I'm pissed years later.
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Damnit how did i forget about this show? If I had to replace a show on my list with Space Brothers, it'd probably be Kill la Kill or Death Parade."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Agreed. Every anime fan needs more Jojo!
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Since you've seem Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, the logical next step is to see Space Dandy made by the same director. Where Cowboy Bebop was jazz and Samurai Champloo was hip hop, Space Dandy is disco/funk. It's also a lot weirder than the other two, but in a good way."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"My main recs would be Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu and Ping Pong the Animation. You could also maybe try Death Parade, Erased, Katanagatari, Natsume's Book of Friends, Shinsekai Yori, and The Tatami Galaxy."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"It's from the 90s but it basically takes the cake when it comes to throwing anime tropes on their head: Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Giant robots fighting giant... ""monsters"" plus depression."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"A little late but I would recommend these. parasyte, banana fish, Durarara, psycho pass, and dororo which is airing me but is very good."
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,"Watch kids on the slope, same person who did bebop Anh champloo"
Tanaka-kun Is Always Listless,Agreed. One of the best shows I’ve seen tbh.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Damn a lot of people still watch GOT
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Poland with Trailer Park Boys in the top 10 lmao
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Hey FYI  - the French show ""The Bureau"" is by FAR the best espionage/spy/thriller TV show out there. Makes shows like Homeland look amateurish. I would highly recommend it."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I'm glad to see that *Dead to Me* made the list.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Surprised Dark isn't on here. Most overlooked show of all time.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"This is fun, would be fun to see this every month (or if you could do it, make a site that automatically updates  each day)"

VIVA LA MERDA"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Wow, ""Hollywood"" so high. Too be fair the first episodes were interesting but then it turned to a cringey cheesefest if there ever was one."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Damn feel like I really need to watch Money Heist now. Happy to see The Last Kingdom on that list, it’s such a good show."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I'm surprised The Last Kingdom was that high.  I've enjoyed the show, I just didn't know it was that popular."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Kirin Ga Kuru - does anybody know how to get hands on those NHK taiga dramas with english subtitles? 

There was once one about Yoshitsune and ""Tales of the Heike"" on youtube, but unfortunately it was pulled after a time so I could never finish it. It was a bit overly long but I found it still very interesting, and learned a lot about Japanese history."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Proof that popularity and quality are not always related. Peaky Blinders LMFAO.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Had no idea Westworld was so popular, am always surprised when it gets renewed each year since nobody really talks highly of it. As someone who loves the movie and really enjoyed season 1, the show turned to absolute shite after it embraced its embarrassingly simple and shallow themes on feminism 101 and introduction to socialism, and the dialogue is atrocious. So much wasted opportunity for a fun and genre bending sci fi show. I was hoping it would be canceled and then rebooted properly in ten years."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Never heard of Money Heist
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Right lol I've seen a lot of people on reddit try to push a ""no one cares about GOT since they ruined it with the last season"" narrative but it seems like a lot of people are still watching the show even a year after it ended."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Doesn't this just mean people are looking up Game of Thrones on Wikipedia? Seems like the type of show where there would be a lot of people looking up stuff about it even if they hate it or aren't watching it.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Well now I’m intrigued, never heard of it. Thanks for the suggestion, I love well made espionage shows"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Dark is a great show that I would not recommend to most people. It is like watching Primer, which is also a good movie but not something I would recommend to people."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Dark is on there for Germany.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,You are welcome :) [https://wikirank.net/#tvseries](https://wikirank.net/#tvseries)
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Thanks, we plan to prepare detailed description in the next research and submit the paper to scientific conference/journal soon.  On the other hand, if some of ""overclockers"" will known how we do that, they will prepare additional ""cheat codes"" ;)"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"That link took me to some alternate world where Wikipedia ain’t in American, I dint like it."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,you should look it up on wikipedia
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"reddit just likes to act like they're smarter than the rest of the population to make themselves feel better. They do the same thing with the movie Avatar. ""There is no cultural impact it's a trash movie blah blah blah"" lmao"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"That's because, despite what many Redditors will have you think, most people watch TV for the journey and not the destination. A few stinkers at the end don't erase all the prior successes of a TV show in the same way that, say, a bad film ending makes the entire film bad."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I think anyone who finishes the show is so disgusted by it, that turning on it is inevitable."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Yeah pretty much which also explains why 'Hollywood' is so popular since it also features some old hollywood stars, not surprised if people are looking those up. It doesn't really mean 'a lot' of people are still watching it but it's a safe assumption I guess. Most shows don't really need to get wikipediaed."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,It’s by far the best one if you can get past the game subtitles it’s great. Ultra realistic
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I always recommend Dark. 

I warn against Primer."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Yeah but even there it's #10. Should be much higher in general.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,What movie? There is only the animated series.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Yes. It's a wonderful show! I need to start my rewatch before season 3 comes out.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Do it, you won’t regret it. I just finished another rewatch of S1 & S2 in preparation and am contemplating doing it. I’ve tried to start other shows since I finished my rewatch about five days ago...but the quality of Dark is so good it feels like others can’t compare right now."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Damn this takes me back. I remember CN would do other music videos with their shows/characters. I remember one with Atom Ant, another with Courage the Cowardly Dog...fun times"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Big-O was a fuckin banger
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,This is some solid nostalgia fuel
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Peter Cullen has that kinda voice that always gives you goosebumps
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Yeah.. I could use a Megadeus
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I remember downloading this on Kazaa. This and their other video “Mad Rhetoric”
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,The one downside of VoD is missing out on these vignettes.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I miss old TN and then adult swim / late night stuff till 4am…
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Man, Toonami was the absolute shit."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,It's tsunami megamix is pretty good with DJ Clark Nova
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"The voiceover is talking about a Terminator-style machine war, but most of the clips are showing mechs with human pilots. Even the bit from Dragonball Z has a human brain."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Fuck this is cool, I wish I'd grown up with Toonami"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKqFBkskx7M
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,My favorite was the [Jabber Jaw](https://youtu.be/Vn1pf0Xi3nU) music video.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Wow I forgot all about those. Thanks for the memories!
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Still is! basically just ""if bruce wayne has a mech"" and also everyone in gotham has amnesia. i still rewatch it about once a year, so much style in that show"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Nothing makes you feel old like finding out Toonami turned 25.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Optimus Prime talking about machines/computers wiping out humanity as they grow self aware. 10/10
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Was that a site like Limewire?
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"**YES THIS IS IT!!!!**

Holy shit, thank you. I'm about to look for their old school bumps and just vibe out to nostalgia."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I remember a cartoon channel put together a bunch of clips of various cartoons set to Bare Naked Ladies “Falling For The First Time” and it always stuck with me.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,If you're interested the band that does this is called Pain and they make great ska music
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"[This is a great channel for that](https://www.youtube.com/c/SlimD716V2/videos), all of Toonami's finest remastered in stunning HD"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Well aware, but thank you! I'm sure Pain is the root of my love for ska as an adult."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"This show is a masterclass of raising stakes in a story.  Do not sleep on it, even if it is dated."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Man, first Babylon 5 is remastered on HBO Max,and now Mobile Suit Gundam is finally streaming.  Good week for sci-fi."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"When I was a kid watching it on toonami I thought it was a mecha show about a whining teen pilot.

After giving it a re-watch, be2i love the spin offs 08th MS team and sequel, Zeta Gundam. I learned it was truly what showed me war is fought by kids, 16-19 year olds who should be making love, or riding bikes in the park. It's deeper than you gave it credit for. The last battle, which takes place over 3 episodes has some of the most heart string drama and best space battles I've see.

Amuro isn't whining, he has PTSD and combat fatigue."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Recommended watching for seasoned mech fans if they haven't already seen it. 

It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

Also the robots r kewl."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,My body is ready for the Bright Slap.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"If you’ve never seen MSG and start with this, don’t worry if it’s not your cup of tea. The fun thing about it is there’s a Gundam for everyone. So you could try one of the other series. Want one that’s coo coo bananas? G Gundam baby! Small scale drama with a Romeo and Juliet bent? 08th MS Team (my personal favorite). There’s even ones that are beyblade with Gundam in Build Drivers. Possibilities are endless"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,[deleted]
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I just checked a week ago and was super disappointed. Checked it this morning and there it is! 

Man. Brings me back to the days of running to the living room, plugging in the code to turn the huge satellite dish, and then going downstairs to watch it with my glass of milk and Oreo pop tarts on my tiny tv."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I was really impressed when I watched this. They did an amazing job of actually making the enemy into human beings instead of just fist shaking villains. Plus, they actually had a setting in which they convinced me that using giant robots to fight made sense."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I just wish we could get Zeta on streaming now, but I assume due to rights issues, pertaining to the opening, that won't happen."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"This show is awful, guys. Nobody watch it. Whole series is based on a lie.

The One Year War doesn’t even last one year."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,A story so good they told it again uh how many series are just a new take on MSG? 7 or so I think
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Can someone verify that this is what **Gundam origins** is the prequel too.  I confused myself reading up on it.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I wish I could bundle this service with other things. The cost is a little high for the amount of anime I would watch but if it were a small add on to like Hulu this would be great.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,will hello kitty appear in the new time line?
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I tried to get into this but couldn't :(
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Great news! I do, however, prefer the the theatrical movies, which do a good job at condensing the series and trimming out the unnecessary fat, not to mention they redid some scenes that looked kind of bad on the show. I'm just sad that we've yet to receive a proper remake of the original. The Origin OVA doesn't cover the whole Origin manga (which is an excellent remake of the original series, authored/illustrated by the original character designer). I'm also sad that we never got a 90s remake in the style of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRtFptEMF8). Damn it would've looked good!"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,No MSG added.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,They're lucky they weren't sued for stealing the lightsaber.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"If your really into this kind of old anime I would suggest watching Legion of the galactic hero's, it's sort of like the [anime version of babylon 5] (https://i.imgur.com/jiVJML3.jpg). They [remade] (https://i.imgur.com/WaDOMAy.jpg) the first two seasons in 2018."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Great!.

Now someone please sort out the details for Space Battleship Yamato (1974).

Can't even find a boxed set for the series that isn't insane due to being out of print."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,So will this be on HBO Max???
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Huge Gundam fan! Such a classic!
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"It also has an amazingly funky soundtrack!

Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"In the start pretty bog standart mecha stuff, but after they arrive to earth becomes a great, but a bit corny, war drama."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"> raising stakes

You might like https://myanimelist.net/anime/19/Monster"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Babylon 5 is being remaster wha??
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,MSG is also on Funimation's streaming service BTW if you prefer mostly dub offerings. Just an FYI.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Yeah there's an episode where Amuro goes fully catatonic and Bright just has him strapped into the gundam and sent off, figuring that once he was in battle he'd snap out of it when his survival instinct kicked in."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Huh, sounds like Evangelion."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"> 
> It's dated, but it's one of the most influential giant robot shows of all time. gets something from this one. Kids going to war, getting psychologically messed up and coming out of it with lost friends and more mental issues then what they came with.

I'd highly recommend checking out Zambot 3, it's Tomino's(Director / Creator of Gundam) previous work that pushed the boundaries on robot anime. Suffice to say a lot of shit gets fucked up and it's not all goofiness."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,08th MS Team is also my favorite. It really hit me different from anything else I had ever seen from Anime up to that point. It was also one of my favorite Gundam toys since it had the working backpack haha.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I fuckin love G Gundam. It's definitely part nostalgia from it airing on Cartoon Network after school when I was a kid. But that series is what got me into Gundam. Everyone hates on it, but its hands down my favorite from what I've seen."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,I liked G Gundam. I liked Gundam Wing more.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Yeah if I'm recommending something to non-anime fans, MSG is not where I'd usually start. It can be...tedious. It is more for the anime fan who wants to see the classic roots of a franchise that now spans several universes."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"9/11 happened and killed off the anime that was ""too serious."" Then Toonami got moved to Saturday and Miguzi, which was lighter fare with shows like Teen Titans and Code Lyoko, took over on weekdays."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"Oh man, is it your first time watching? You're in for a ride! Definitely check out Zeta Gundam when you finish and the rest of the UC and other Gundam and mecha stuff in general. There's some incredible stuff out there that deals with some really heavy themes.

If you have any questions or need reccomendations, the folks over at r/Gundam are super friendly! Welcome, fellow Newtype!"
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"They simply replaced the opening song on the blu-ray, surely they could do that for streaming."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"I haven't seen Gundam and don't know the story of it beyond that people pilot robots but if a war happened *within* one year then I think ""One Year War"" is an appropriate name for it."
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,Seed was like a shot for shot remake at some points.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,The Gundam Origins OVA is a prequel to Mobile Suit Gundam... sorta. It’s technically pulled from the Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga which was a retelling of Mobile Suit Gundam and is made by one of the original illustrators of the show. It changes a few things from the original series but but you can still watch the Gundam Origins OVAs as prequel content to the original series.
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam,"This is correct. Gundam has 2 universes to it

1. ""The Universal Century"" which is what the ""main"" story of Gundam is. Its a massive war between the Zeon and the Earth Federation

2. Pretty much everything NOT the Universal Century. These are just one off worlds/dimensions that exist to tell a single story in a season, they have no relation to the Universal Century. These stories are actually more popular in terms of viewership- ""G Gundam"" (my favorite) Iron Blooded Orphans Gundam Seed and Gundam Wing

The UC is about 2 guys, Amuro Ray who is the protagonist and Char Aznable who is the anti-villain of the show. Gundam Origins gives us the backstory of Char Aznable. Gundam Origins is hella tight though, its effectively a Monte Cristo story"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Kitty!
The Vision of Escaflowne,Hopefully she'll have more to do this time around.
The Vision of Escaflowne,I assume she’ll be involved at the beginning assuming she’s still in Westview where Agatha was left at the end of WandaVision
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Between the mcu and that 90s show, it’s nice to see her still around!"
The Vision of Escaflowne,she’s good in any decade!
The Vision of Escaflowne,this feels so right! Between her and Aubrey Plaza they are just loading this show with talent
The Vision of Escaflowne,Wasn't Amy Poehler rumored to be also in this?
The Vision of Escaflowne,That’s a W. This lady delivers everything she does like it’s a hot pizza fresh from the oven.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Spin-offs are getting spin-offs, soon we won’t know who has been spun and who did the spinning."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"I assume she’s coming back as Sharon Davis / ""Mrs. Hart""?"
The Vision of Escaflowne,WandaVision fans can’t stop winning
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Emma Caulfield next, please!"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Kathryn Hahn is such a sight for sore eyes.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Oh thank god, now I won't have to watch That 90's Show to see more of her."
The Vision of Escaflowne,she was awesome
The Vision of Escaflowne,Looks like we are getting the witness protection storyline payoff.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"After this show end, they announce another spin off from char in this spin off"
The Vision of Escaflowne,So excited for this‼️ hopefully Wanda appearance is the twist for its finale
The Vision of Escaflowne,I LOVE HER!
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Yay, hopefully he gets revenge on Wanda"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Brilliant
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Man, I’m excited for both actresses but wtf is Marvel doing? The first four phases were great because a singular narrative carried it through and the concept was fresh. This is a sidequest of a sidequest."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Disney continuing it's ""let's throw shit at the wall"" strategy for it's Marvel and Star Wars IPs"
The Vision of Escaflowne,The only spinoff I'm looking forward too.
The Vision of Escaflowne,[deleted]
The Vision of Escaflowne,"No disrespect intended but, who is this show for?"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Literally noone is going to watch this crap. The MCU is dead
The Vision of Escaflowne,On my watchlist as of this reading.
The Vision of Escaflowne,This is great
The Vision of Escaflowne,This show is defs not my demographic. I’ll probs binge it once it’s all over since it’s still MCU.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Uhh, so I assume this is how they’re getting Wanda back? If this barrage of content from Marvel is called the Multiverse Saga, surely they can’t leave her in the fridge too long."
The Vision of Escaflowne,Barrel meet bottom.
The Vision of Escaflowne,There is a Wandavision spinoff?  I loved that show but thought it wasn't popular enough to have legs.
The Vision of Escaflowne,No thank you please. The Agatha story is over. They where both good characters but it’s time to move on
The Vision of Escaflowne,Not interested at all.  They should focus more on quality over quantity.  Marvel hasn't been good since Endgame.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Love her, but this show isn’t gonna be good"
The Vision of Escaflowne,This probably the most unnecessary MCU ever to exist.
The Vision of Escaflowne,Just because a character is fun doesnt mean they can front run their own show and I think this will be proof of that.
The Vision of Escaflowne,You have brain rot if you are unironically excited for marvels most unashamed attempt at building a random franchise out of nothing
The Vision of Escaflowne,When do the goats from Thor get their own spinoff?
The Vision of Escaflowne,Did any non-MCU die hard fans actually enjoy Agatha? She was pointless and annoying at the end
The Vision of Escaflowne,i wonder what story they have in mind considering all the marvel movies just about villains have generally sucked ass
The Vision of Escaflowne,Looks awful
The Vision of Escaflowne,No thanks.
The Vision of Escaflowne,9**>
The Vision of Escaflowne,Every day we stray further from grace.
The Vision of Escaflowne,FOR MALRIC!
The Vision of Escaflowne,She’s mephesto or lady death
The Vision of Escaflowne,Should have been the first choice and from the looks of the daily’s it’s supposed to have a comedic bent.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Dammit, just keep adding my favorite actors. I’ll have to give Disney money again."
The Vision of Escaflowne,“It’s pronounce Coe-ven…” “Coven sounds like oven.”
The Vision of Escaflowne,Love the actress but Disney can fuck right off with all these shows
The Vision of Escaflowne,"I was disappointed that Wandavision didn't have her show up during the 70s episode.

Would've been natural for her."
The Vision of Escaflowne,Kitty Foreman is now MCU
The Vision of Escaflowne,*laughs in Kitty*
The Vision of Escaflowne,Red always knew
The Vision of Escaflowne,“Stop it.”
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Doubt it, she'll probably be in Westview at the beginning."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Well, she was involved in WandaVision's best scene at least, where she crushed it.  
The dinner scene in ep 1 was the high water mark of Marvel D+ TV for me with its David Lynch horror tension vibes. I wish the show leaned into the horror a bit more than we got, like Legion did with its first season."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"When the Seinfeld reboot inevitably comes around, I hope she's there helping Jerry get gigs after doing hard time."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"And she has barely aged a day since the 70s show.

She must have achieved final form."
The Vision of Escaflowne,Was Aubrey Plaza in the Wandavision? Or is she just going to be in this spin-off show? I can't remember her in Wandavision.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"> Between her and ~~Aubrey Plaza~~ **Patti Lupone** they are just loading this show with talent

ftfy"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Are you genuinely surprised that a tv show based off a comic book has a spinoff? Comics are all just spinoffs of each other already anyway.
The Vision of Escaflowne,The Tommy Westphall universe would like to speak to you.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Nah, mephisto for sure"
The Vision of Escaflowne,"The ending of WandaVision with no Kat Dennings... and stupid Ralph Boehner

But otherwise yes."
The Vision of Escaflowne,[deleted]
The Vision of Escaflowne,She's already been [confirmed](https://www.eonline.com/news/1354207/wandavisions-emma-caulfield-teases-what-to-expect-from-agatha-coven-of-chaos).
The Vision of Escaflowne,Ahh the good old days of 2-3 movies a year. When they felt fresh and unique. Now we get new marvel content 10-15 times a year and it’s impossibly tiring
The Vision of Escaflowne,Probably fans of Wandavision and MCU in general.
The Vision of Escaflowne,People like my gf who salivate over anything involving Wanda.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"I just finished Midnight Suns, and… your comment gives me a few ideas on how that could work"
The Vision of Escaflowne,"I think Wandavision is almost definitely the most popular MCU show, rivalled only by Loki maybe."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"It definitely was but, even if it was not, that doesn’t mean a spin-off isn’t warranted or viable."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"I like that you’re getting downvoted for simply not knowing a piece of information and expressing your pleasant surprise as a fan of the show.

Never change, Reddit!"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Legs? The last Dr. Strange movie was practically a WandaVision spin-off.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"you don’t understand marvel, it doesn’t matter if the story is “over”, the comics keep going, the camera stays on. Half the time the characters know it, we know it; we are stuck in the same hell. The same cycle of creation and consumption.
You may say “move on”, marvel says, “let it stew”.
Eventually all of the characters will end up as a giant polycule on a sapient island utopia and we will keep watching, and they will watch back."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"In the multiverse era, no character's story is completely over"
The Vision of Escaflowne,No way home says hello
The Vision of Escaflowne,Not sure about Agatha as a character but Kathryn Hahn can definitely lead a show as an actor.
The Vision of Escaflowne,They definitely set up plenty of foundation for her back story to build on. Plus she was a good character played by an amazing actress. You can just not watch but other people are interested in watching it
The Vision of Escaflowne,"> building a random franchise out of nothing

Wanda, who first appeared in 1964, is ""random"" and made ""out of nothing""?

She's had stories longer than you've been alive."
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Let me guess.  Avatar fan.

Edit:  lol dudes post history is him discussing the complex minutiae of Avatar 2: Water."
The Vision of Escaflowne,They did a little that 70s show reference though with her which was nice
The Vision of Escaflowne,"i’m sorry what? she’s in the WV lol, just not as Kitty"
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Well, if the Riverdale gang and M&Ms can be part of Marvel, why not Kitty Forman?"
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Red shows up in a post credits scene wearing an eyepatch. ""I'm here to tell you about the My Foot In Your Ass initiative, dumbass."""
The Vision of Escaflowne,"I think it was just the right amount of horror. I went into this show thinking it was just gonna be quirky old TV reference humor, but the unsettling character breaks and the dinner made me realize how dark this show could get while still holding on to the old timey format."
The Vision of Escaflowne,Love that episode! One of my favorites. “The pilot is in the audience.”
The Vision of Escaflowne,Yeah the whole cast of That 70s Show seems to have aged well!
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Not sure what you fixed by removing Plaza’s name, you may not be a fan but someone else is, grow up man"
The Vision of Escaflowne,Aubrey Plaza was the highlight of the new season of White Lotus.
The Vision of Escaflowne,"Not surprised at all, just being a bit cheeky. I’ve got Marvel fatigue but I’m probably in the minority there, especially as someone who likes comic books."
The Vision of Escaflowne,Yeah both are mass produced with often similar quality...
The Vision of Escaflowne,"More likely, I think this could be the Wolverine recasting we have been waiting for."
The Vision of Escaflowne,I hope when Mephisto actually shows up it defies all odds and actually surprises everyone. I think he'd have to be the fourth wall itself to be something that nobody predicted... except I predicted it just now!
The Vision of Escaflowne,She's actually the new Black Panther.
The Vision of Escaflowne,I didn’t even read your comment and I downvoted by instinct
The Vision of Escaflowne,Hell yes.
Modus,"As much as I like Scandinavian thrillers, there's just no way I can see Sofia Helin as anyone other than Det. Saga Noren. It's doubly hard as that scar (from a bike accident when she was 24) really sold her as only Saga to me. 

I guess I can pretend she got a law degree after leaving the Malmo PD...."
Modus,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"
Modus,"I agree but for my favorites are a bit different than yours. I really liked the Mandalorian, Watchmen, His Dark Materials, The Imagineering Story, and The Boys. 2019 was also a pretty good year for movies too but that's a different topic lol"
Modus,"Thank you, discovered Dead Pixels from this and will try it esp as I loved Mythic Quest"
Modus,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. 😩"
Modus,Holy shit. 100% forgot that Watchmen was 2019. lol.
Modus,You're welcome. 😊
Modus,What We Do in the Shadows is the best new comedy in ages.
Modus,"Succession, Chernobyl, white lotus"
Modus,"Ted Lasso,  Succession, A.P. Bio .. there's quite a few out there."
Modus,"Corporate, I Think You Should Leave"
Modus,"1. Kingdom - The film was disappointing
2. Vinland Saga
3. Chernobyl
4. Succession
5. Fruits Basket (2019)
6. Squid Game
7. The Boys
8. When They See Us
9. Invincible

A bit of a mixed list. I started to try more Korean series and they are pretty good."
Modus,The Other Two is top tier
Modus,"Succession, mare of East Town, Ted lasso, the boys, Yellowstone, Dave, perry Mason, altered carbon, the righteous gemstones, marvelous Mrs Maisel, dead to me, you, watchman, chernobyl"
Modus,"What we do in the shadows, reservation dogs"
Modus,"Succession is my current favorite, can't wait for Season 3!"
Modus,"My Brilliant Friend isn't a miniseries. There were 2 seasons and a third will be broadcasted sometime early next year, I'm hoping for this year. There are more seasons to come to going by the books. The show is ongoing and is not over yet."
Modus,Loved **My Brilliant Friend** and **ZeroZeroZero**
Modus,I wanted to like Succession but was really put of by the shaky cam from episode 1. Is it worth me trying again? I coped with 2008 and I promised myself never again.
Modus,"Sex Education, hands down."
Modus,"I know it only started last week, but I'm blown away by Foundation. I've watched it 3 times this week."
Modus,"Looking through my past few top 10 lists: Haunting of Hill House, My Brilliant Friend, Pose, Watchmen, Ramy, For All Mankind, Mrs. America, Devs, The Circle, The Queen's Gambit, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, The Mandalorian, The Good Lord Bird, Reservation Dogs"
Modus,Pen15
Modus,What we do in the shadows is a hidden gem. Filmed like the office but with vampires. Pretty entertaining.
Modus,"Primal, Ted Lasso, Every single marvel show, The Mandalorian."
Modus,Derry Girls. Scenes from a Marriage. Ted Lasso. Crash Landing on You.
Modus,I think it's a great thread
Modus,Hands down. The whole ensemble is fantastic.
Modus,HBO gang!
Modus,White lotus was terrible
Modus,"Yeah, Corporate really doesn't get mentioned enough.  One of the better Comedy Central shows in quite a while. Good to see someone else liked it too."
Modus,"I'm sorry about that it's a typo. 😅 Obviously some copy and pasting was done here. As you can see I put ""2 seasons (ongoing)"" and still for some reason have ""miniseries"" beneath it. My bad lol."
Modus,Crazy how these two are so different and yet they are also on some of the best shows I saw in 2020-21. I stumbled across Brilliant Friend on a work trip in the hotel room and ZeroZeroZero led me to Gomorra which was probably my favorite of the three.
Modus,💕
Modus,I found that really annoying and distracting as well. Sometimes I was on the verge of motion sickness and had to take breaks. But either I got used to it or it stopped/decreased because I can't remember being bothered by it throughout and I made it through both seasons.
Modus,Definitely Primal. Hard to believe how good it is honestly.
Modus,Did you watch the 3rd episode?
Modus,The prevailing theme I've seen with this attitude is that it's usually from the kind of people White Lotus was satirizing.
Modus,"If that is true, perhaps some people don't like seeing themselves portrayed harshly again and again and made to feel shame."
Modus,What kind of people would that be? I’m a Black woman with a working class background.
Modus,"I loved ZeroZeroZero,It was amazing"
Modus,"Yellowstone

Ozark

The Queen's Gambit"
Modus,"Ah, I see you've finally ended up watching *Veneno*! I'm glad you enjoyed it as much as I thought you would. It really is an incredible piece of television that too few people watched. I'd say it's my favourite miniseries for sure, eclipsing *The Haunting of Hill House* which previously held the top spot. I can't wait for whatever the Javis choose to do next!"
Modus,"What we do in the shadows, is it too soon for reservation dogs"
Modus,"So this was initially going to be 'Best 15 TV Cinematography of All Time' *or something like that*, until I realized how complicated it actually is to write about visuals in TV shows, especially for shows I haven't seen in a while, so I decided to spend yesterday evening writing this up instead (*might still finish the cinematography one too though*). 

  
Anyways, share you thoughts! What do you think of the list? What shows do you think deserve to be there that are not? And of course vice-versa, which of my choices do you find unworthy? 

  
p.s. P-Valley is the show I feel guilty for not putting on the list. Either way, go watch P-Valley on Starz guys!! 

  
R.I.P. rorochan\_1999. 🕊️"
Modus,"I love your lists, man. Keep it up."
Modus,Why is Game of Thrones not there?
Modus,I love korean drama serial... giving importance to their cultural and family affection...
Modus,Ozark was released 2017 I'm sure. I love The Queen's Gambit!! Never seen Yellowstone though. 😐
Modus,"Yea loved Veneno from start to finish!! Second episode is definitely my favorite though, easily one of the single most touching and poignant TV episodes I've ever seen!

I almost forgot you were the one that recommended it to me. Thanks a lot! lol."
Modus,😊💕
Modus,Because it's shit?
Modus,This is a list of newer shows that premiered between 2018-2021
Modus,2018 - 2020. 🤷
Modus,"It's Always Sunny - The Gang Solves the Gas Crisis is always my go-to for what the show is about. It shows all their personalities very well, has two very good plots that are incredibly insane and yet you could also believe they'd happen in these crazy peoples' lives."
Modus,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer's season one finale, Prophecy Girl.  It always bugs me when people suggest to skip the first season of the show, if only because Prophecy Girl is pretty much Buffy's thesis statement."
Modus,"Modern Doctor Who S2E4 ""The Girl in the Fireplace: scary villains, meeting a historical figure, time travel shenanigans with a clever premise. It shows how truly heartbreaking the life of the Doctor is, but also how exciting it can be. Just a masterpiece episode."
Modus,"While Community has some great episodes, S3E4 (""Remedial Chaos Theory"") is probably the best fit for this since it shows off a bunch of different characterizations and relationships over its 20 minutes. 

Like you get to see Britta be a lovable goof but also bond with Troy, you get to see Troy and Abed together and apart, or you get to see Jeff flirt with Annie but also insecure about his own age. You get to see how the group functions when they're all together, and how functional/dysfunctional they are when you take just one of them out of the equation.

And from a writing side, it's a high-concept episode featuring only the main cast and some banter, some jokes, and some physical comedy."
Modus,"Man, that X Files revelation was huge. I never doubted the main character until then. The tag line ""I want to believe"" was so powerful it will stick with me forever. That episode solidified the idea."
Modus,"I would say that this scene in the season 1 finale of LOST is a beautiful summary of the whole series:



https://youtu.be/-OBo9fQbJ8M"
Modus,"The West Wing S1E10 - ""In Excelsis Deo"" 

The president is trying to do some normal Christmas shopping and Toby learns about a Korean War vet who died alone and homeless. It showcases all that is great about this series."
Modus,"This is probably an unpopular opinion but I think Game of Thrones is best encapsulated by the Season 4 finale – The Children.  There's a central premise of generational drama and angst, but mostly..it has everything. Slave/dragon drama with Daenerys. Weird Bran Stuff Beyond the wall stuff. Three characters killed. A character admitting incest to her father.  A violent one on one sword fight. A child deciding to travel by herself and leaving someone for dead."
Modus,"For Always Sunny I always recommend the Dumpster Baby episode for someone just starting. Each character has their own sideplot that perfectly highlights their character traits.

Frank and Charlie become obsessed with hoarding trash and end up collecting so much that they can no longer fit in the apartment and end up homeless sleeping in the streets.

Dee and Mac, instead of trying to reunite the found baby with its parents, decide to use the baby to make them as much money as they can, including covering it in shoe polish to make it look non-white so it can become more profitable in the TV ad business.

Dennis, after a small argument with a hippy, devotes his whole story this episode to manipulating and crafting events to take his revenge on the hippy. He ends up sleeping with his girlfriend, convincing the guy to spend all night in a storm chained to a tree, and results in him arranging the destruction of the trees that the hippy was so dead set in protecting.

And of course, there's a fantastic ending that results in all these convergent plot lines all coming together in classic sitcom style."
Modus,[deleted]
Modus,"Supernatural Season 1 Episode 1

It's a show about these two brothers, that's the show. Their chemistry is the show and why you love it and why you will stick with it for fifteen seasons in my case. Everything else can fall by the side but Dean and Sam Winchester hunting things and saving people, suffered tragedy and continue the fight."
Modus,"Scrubs - My Old Lady, My Screw Up, My Long Goodbye, My Lunch, My Musical

These episodes capture important themes that crop up consistently throughout Scrubs’ run, and they are all showcase loss and pain in a way that resonates whilst also maintaining an optimism that you need to have in a job like that. They will all make you laugh and quite possibly make you cry too. 

Irreverent humour balanced out with a weighty dose of reality.

I also think “My Finale” remains one of the best finales in TV history."
Modus,"Fringe, the season 2 episode ""White Tulip"". All you Fringe fans already know why. Compelling and emotional episodic story that plays directly into the current season arc (you could even call it the series arc). A reference to this episode even made its way into the series finale, so you know it really resonated."
Modus,"The Constant from LOST encapsulates every element that people really loved about that show into one near-perfect episode. It hits every major theme the show has, features some of the best lore-building, the best writing, best music of the series and an emotional payoff that leave won’t leave a dry eye.  It’s far and away LOSTs best episode."
Modus,There is an episode of travelers told from the perspective of guest stars trying to save the main cast in a way that is basically the entire premise of the main plotline.  Its also told in a unique way and makes that single episode stand out apart from the rest of the show.  Its also my favorite episode due to the plot device employed to tell the story.
Modus,"Spoilers for American Gods, including the book ending: the opening scene of the first episode isn't directly connected to the main storyline and doesn't feature any of the main cast.  It appears to be there for world building and to introduce how gods and belief work.  But if you know how the book ends, you'll see that it is actually summarising the entire plot and showing you why everything happened the way that it did. This is only apparent once the story concludes."
Modus,"33 BSG: Even if you didn't watch the miniseries, you get a full glimpse of what the show's about.

Puppet patrol from Doom Patrol: it gives you a set up of the plot, the characters and above all- the insanity.

The Americans: The last episode of the fourth season and the first of the fifth season. One of my favorite parts of the show. It shows how determined the leads were and the cost of their commitment to the cause. 

The fourth season was great, I recommend any ep. that has to do with Young Hee. That storyline was brutal.

The detour: The restaurant.

Veep: Congressional ball. It encapsulates the incompetence Selina is surrounded by, all the while making her own mistakes. One of the best episodes."
Modus,"For Breaking Bad, I think the pilot is the perfect encapsulation of what makes the show great. 

Sure, over the course of the series the writing, cinematography, production value, etc, became more refined, but the core of the show is all in that first episode."
Modus,"Second season, Parks and Recreation - The Master Plan. Introduces everyone who is permanent moving forward and highlights every characters key characteristics."
Modus,"Arrested Development, S1 E2.  ""There's always money in the banana stand.""  

Even at the start of the series, all the character's true colors are on display.

[GOB is an incompetent asshole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-zConMzGHo).  George Sr. is a scheming asshole.  Self-righteous Michael smugly thinks he's the responsible one, but is hardly more capable than GOB, [and sees himself as a good father when completely dismissive.](https://youtu.be/ZdGrC9S4PYA).  [Maeby is rebellious and not too bright, while George Michael is a pushover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSS7iJUsYCY).  [Tobias has a terrible audition](https://youtu.be/M5hgjlOeA24?t=15)

There's also a handful of [recurring joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04SLXwjJvqg)s and callbacks that would eventually become a big part of AD's identity."
Modus,"*Rixty Minutes* from Rick and Morty

Rick tinkers and creates a wacky premise, belittling Beth and Jerry's marriage, and saying that basically 'nothing matters'.  
Morty goes with the flow, but translates the insights from his previous wackiness to help Summer.  
Beth and Jerry verge on divorce, but realize they love each other and decide to stay together.  
Summer realizes her place in the family, but takes a step towards becoming part of the R&M adventure crew at the end."
Modus,"Avatar: The Last Airbender - while some people may watch the first few episodes of Book One and not really get what makes it amazing, once you get to The Storm (S1, E12) that changes. This episode hits on all the little notes that make the show amazing. It connects most of the main characters' struggles and shows that there is a lot of depth to the show's world."
Modus,"Bojack Horseman - season 4 episode 2 “The Old Sugarman Place” is what I use to try to convert someone who couldn’t get through the first few episodes. It is very self contained unlike most bojack episodes and aptly showcases both the dramatic, comedic and philosophical potential the show has"
Modus,Agent of shield episode 13 season one T.R.A.C.K.S.
Modus,"Kind of think the last ep of S1 of Mad Men, where Don goes from a touching presentation about family for the Carousel to coming home to an empty house, all his fault. He was selling a lie and damn good at it"
Modus,"*The Magicians*, S3E5, ""A Life in the Day."" It's the most *Magicians* episode of the entire five-year run of *The Magicians*.

Quentin and Elliot live out an entire lifetime in an alternate timeline, raising a family while they try to solve a magical puzzle. The ending is absolutely perfect: the timeline is erased, but the memories are reawakened when they taste fruit.

It perfectly captures the essence and mood of the show, the wonder and the bittersweet nature of magic."
Modus,"MASH - Sometimes you hear the bullet.  Had laughs, had drama."
Modus,"Cheers Season 1, Episode 11 ""One For The Book"" 

Its regular people coming and going, stories told, stories made, everyone contributes a little and gets a chance to shine. 

Its the best of cheers - a bunch of very different lovable losers converge on a bar to make themselves feel better about life. 

In this episode an 80+ year old WWI vet shows up to Cheers for his squad's reunion........only to realize he's the sole survivor now, and a young man about to enter a monastery comes in for his first ever drink and questions his path in life - all while Diane is writing down ""snippets of Americana"" - things she hears in the bar from everyday people, and Sam is desperate to be quoted

Its heartwarming, clever without being pedantic, never preachy, and hilarious. Holds up to this day."
Modus,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force - (S5E7) Laser Lenses.

You get to see how all the characters' personalities are pretty clearly. The episode has the characters dealing with eye problems."
Modus,"This might be cheating a bit but the first 2 episodes of Person of Interest's second season. It has both the 'Case-of-the-week' aspect that's a huge part of the show, but it also starts to delve into the sci-fi that the first season only touched upon."
Modus,"Star Trek: The Corbomite Maneuver

The Enterprise encounters an enemy so massive and belligerent, the entire crew should be crapping themselves (and a few do).  This episode demonstrates the maturity that humanity must achieve if we're to advance as a species.  It also showcases the three main characters' personality and interaction, as well as the difference between chess and poker."
Modus,"“Malcolm in the Middle” has a great bowling episode in S2 Ep20. It shows the parenting style of Hal and Lois. Each version shows how the boys act in public when the parents interfere or let them be. We also get to see Dewey manipulate Hal and try his tricks on Lois. I can’t remember the Francis storyline, but I love this episode for the different/simultaneous scenes."
Modus,"The pilot of Rick & Morty is perfect for this example. Specifically, the cold open.

https://youtu.be/tTLAoI-wlAc

While both their characterizations have changed since season 1, I think this open represents them and the general story structures of the first few seasons just amazingly. It's also extremely funny, especially Morty's facial expressions"
Modus,"The podcast Extra Hot Great has a segment in every episode where they discuss exactly this.

Modus,"Adventure Time s1e10 memories of boom boom mountain

Sets up the basic premise of a boy and his magical dog live in a fun magical world of hijinx who just try to help people whenever possible, while realizing things aren't always as simple as they seem. Also first episode to shed a light on Finns past.

Trailer Park Boys s3e3 if I can't smoke and swear, I'm fucked

Shows everything about who the characters are and what they do. Rick trying to be a good dad by helping trinity quit smoking. Julien hopping on the idea to sell stolen gas. Bubbles getting mad at Ricky for stealing and doing extra illegal stuff that goes against the plan. Cory and Trevor doing all the grunt work and taking the fall, Lahey and Randy drunk off their ass and trying to get the boys in trouble with the law. The best episodes usually follow this patern, but this one stands out because it's one of few times you see them in a court room and not just talking their way out of it with the cops or ending up right back in jail."
Modus,">1.) An episode that sums up that the modus operandi of a series (like Seinfeld S4E3, “The Pitch”, since it very literally describes the purpose of the series as being “a show about nothing” using Jerry’s TV pitch as a frame)

""The Pitch"" does **not** sum up *Seinfeld*'s modus operandi, it is a parody of the show's modus operandi. This has been debunked time and time again."
Modus,"From one of my (ok my most) favourite(s) - The Good Wife: it's this episode called ""What's In The Box"". 

- some of their best recurring stars, always the show's strength
- race against time courtroom stuff
- abundant humor without losing the plot 
- amazing chemistry between all the characters 
- it's the season 4 finale and kind of pivotal for the show but wow, that last moment - typical TGW - no cliffhangers but still incredibly exciting and unexpected"
Modus,"Vision Quest-Archer

If it hadn’t been for the fact that it was in season 6, it really could have been used as a pilot episode (except for a throw away line) it does a really good job at explaining the groups dynamics and Cheryl quite literally points out all their flaws to their faces."
Modus,"Venture Bros S2E4, Escape to the House of Movies Part 2.

Don't let the name fool you, there is no part 1. Because of this the show just kind of thrusts you into one of the titular family's adventures. A hilarious episode with several stories that are all self contained."
Modus,"Westworld S1 finale. Ford's speech literally tells you what the series is about. The entire speech is pure genius:

[Spoilers](#s ""Since I was a child I've always loved a good story. I believed that stories helped us to ennoble ourselves, to fix what was broken in us, and to help us become the people we dreamed of being. Lies that told a deeper truth. I always thought I could play some small part in that grand tradition. And for my pains I got this: a prison of our own sins. 'Cause you don't want to change. Or cannot change. Because you're only human, after all. But then I realized someone was paying attention, someone who could change. So I began to compose a new story for them. It begins with the birth of a new people and the choices they will have to make and the people they will decide to become. And we'll have all those things that you have always enjoyed. Surprises and violence. It begins in a time of war with a villain named Wyatt and a killing. This time by choice. I'm sad to say this will be my final story. An old friend once told me something that gave me great comfort. Something he had read. He said that Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin never died. They simply became music. So, I hope you will enjoy this last piece very much."")

It's also why people who say Westworld should have been a 1 season show are wrong. The show is about the origin of a new species, the hosts, and what they will become, and it will end when this story finishes."
Modus,"Please don't crucify me. But I think The Bells did a great job of showing the horrors of war and how the common people are merely pawns in the struggle for power. Like even Varys' plan was to starve the people so that they would do the fighting against Cersei. And while more time should have been spent developing the lead up to this, Daenerys deciding that she hast to rule with fear so she doesn't lose the throne she had always desired is amazingly acted by Emilia."
Modus,"Twin Peaks, season 3, Part 8.

It's the whole surrealism David Lynch has always been playing with taken to it's absolute extreme."
Modus,"The Americans - ""The Magic of David Copperfield V: The Statue of Liberty Disappears"".

Justified - ""Harlan Roulette""

Mr Robot - ""eps3.1\_undo.gz"""
Modus,"Buffy the Vampire Slayer's ""Earshot"" (Season 3) has always been my go-to answer for questions like this. It's a perfect blend of the show's monster of the week concept mixed with that wonderful high school drama the show excelled in. It's an incredibly funny, heartfelt and serious episode of television, and Sarah Michelle Gellar gives a great performance in it. If anyone ever asks me which episode of Buffy to try out to see if the show is for them, Earshot would always be my answer here, it is truly representative of everything that made Buffy a wonderful show."
Ice Fantasy,"Thank you for making this thread, so the front page isn't half Rings of Power reviews lmao"
Ice Fantasy,"The common thread in every interview seems to be that it’s visually spectacular - no surprise there. 

The division is at whether the plot, writing and characters are any good, which is more or less what I assumed would be divisive from the very beginning.

I’ll hold my ultimate judgement until after the season finale (keep in mind most critics only got the first two episodes), but until then I remain a bit skeptical that Amazon Studios has what it takes to produce HBO level prestige television.

Edit: Something to keep in mind - it seems like everyone besides LA Times (who got 6 episodes) only saw the first two, which are undoubtably going to be worldbuilding heavy. Considering that a lot of recent Marvel/Star Wars offerings on D+ seem to start off promising and become gradually more divisive in reception, it’s plausible that ROP is the opposite. There’s some heavyweight talent on the writing staff which is basically the only reason I have some optimism."
Ice Fantasy,I dunno man. Calling a work based on Tolkien “Game of Thrones-lite” is not the compliment rogerebert.com thinks it is.
Ice Fantasy,"I just watched the first two episodes in a fan screening. AMA I guess.

Overall pretty good, with not really impressive writing (especially when compared to HOTD), but some actually decent dialogue I thought.

Absolutely astonishing production value.

Missed some of the warmth of the LOTR films.

I’ve never read LOTR so feel free to disregard my opinion.

EDIT: Also, serious moments were serious (no random quips) and the comedy was still pretty good when adequate. That was nice."
Ice Fantasy,Making a judgement off two episodes seems dumb.
Ice Fantasy,"So far it all indicates at starting slow and taking its time to building the world.

Rather than just throwing people into the LOTR universe. And I prefer for shows to take their time rather than having 5 minutes if world building and that's it and roll the action.

Also I imagine it will be hard to compact 2 or 3000 years worth of story into several seasons."
Ice Fantasy,I find it kind of annoying that everyone frames their take around how expensive it is. It’s not like you or I had to pay for it. I don’t see why it matters
Ice Fantasy,[removed]
Ice Fantasy,Seems like its visually spectacular (which you would hope considering the insane pricetag) but so far we haven't got much meaty or satisfying characters or story yet. Lets hope they can deliver some solid character work considering they've only got three quarters of the seaosn left.
Ice Fantasy,How long are the first two episodes?
Ice Fantasy,"Saw the premiere last night at my local theater and loved what I'm seeing so far. First episode is slow setting things up, but I'm already familiar with the characters, their motives, etc. come the second episode. Can't wait for more next week!"
Ice Fantasy,"Thoroughly enjoyed this, very intrigued to see how things play out. The guy on the raft could not have looked more like Vijo Morganstein if they tried. I assume he'll have something to do with Numenor. Also, I loved Frankenstein Gandalf."
Ice Fantasy,"How's is bezos Washington Post giving it the worst.


That's oddly funny..fuck Bezo btw.

But I hope this show is good"
Ice Fantasy,Color me cautiously optimistic.
Ice Fantasy,I rate it 19 out of 20 rings of power.
Ice Fantasy,It seems like it's too early to tell if it's good or if it just looks good.
Ice Fantasy,Would like to say the Grace Randolph review is pretty funny
Ice Fantasy,Why does it just screams…. “The story is just slow as hell”
Ice Fantasy,"Just saw the first two episodes in a fan screening. As a mild Lord of the Rings fan, I really enjoyed them.

Visually it's absolutely gorgeous. I haven't been so inspired and awestruck by sets and locations like this in years.

As far as writing goes I'm very excited with the direction and setup. I know a handful of people who think Lord of the Rings is boring. I don't think so but I understand why. I'm exaggerating here but they're kinda like watching a textbook of events that occured. It's similar to Peter Jackson's King Kong. There's a lot of characters and they try to inject warmth and relatability into the characters but at the end of the day it feels like it's more about the plot and getting from point a to point b than exploring characters. I feel like to get the full experience and to love the characters completely I'd have to go research their lives.

Rings of Power however already does a lot more groundwork introducing the world and characters in a way that in my opinion isn't boring and builds more of a rapport between the viewers and the characters. Already I feel closer to and care about many of the characters nearly as much as I do the Lord of the Rings characters. I found them very charming. I chuckled a lot and even characters I was unsure about ended up being my favorites. Take this with a grain of salt though, because as I stated I'm a mild fan. I haven't read any of the books and am not bringing textbooks of lore into my opinion.

I keep seeing this compared to Game of Thrones which is just a bunch of tribal marketing in my opinion. The way I see it Game of Thrones is great for all of the politics, intrigue, scheming, and human interactions. And I think Lord of the Rings is great for it's fantasy, wonder, adventure, and beauty. So I think it's completely reasonable to like one more than the other or both (in my case) for different reasons.

Anyways. Ask me anything if you want."
Ice Fantasy,"The AV Club just released their review, and they grade it an A-, saying it's ""one of the most captivating fantasy worlda in TV history"".

https://www.avclub.com/lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-review-1849479930"
Ice Fantasy,"so, Prime is the only service I don't have, so I may have to end up sailing the high seas for the premiere of this one, man, why couldn't this be on HBO?"
Ice Fantasy,"Its amazing tonsee the massive disconnect from professional critics and audiences. To critics, this show is a masterpiece. To the actual viewers, who make the show money, its a disasterl... mostly. Sitting at high 30s on RT right now and no better elsewhere for viewer reviews. 

Everyone seems to agree that the show is visually stunning. Its amazing looking, but thats what throwing an ungodly amount of money at a show will do. However, most agree that the rest of the show is just bad. There are a variety of reasons given. Bad acting, bad writing, ignoring set lore, injecting real world social views into a world that it doesnt fit into.... then we have actors on social media making things worse, as usual these days when a show was likely doomed to fail to begin with. 

I watched it. Not a fan. I loved the previous entries. I even rewatched and read everything again before. Its something I like to do when things like this come out. I was let down. They ignored the source material. They ignored established lore and changed it. In ky eyes, they solidified that this can not and will not be canon too. 

I was excited at first, despite the bad press. I was let down. I was bored and disappointed. I made it to the second episode and I am done. I wont watch any more. I am one who gave it a bad review. If you are going to base a show on an established world with a lot of rich lore, you need to actually follow that lore. You need to try and add story to the world, not change it. 

Thats my 2 cents on the matter. Agree with it or dont. Watch if you want. If you enjoy it, great for you. Thats awesome. I dont. I think its a polished turd and nothing more. Shiny on the outside but inside, its still just a turd."
Ice Fantasy,"I don't like it, struggle to stay awake after 4 episodes."
Ice Fantasy,"Far better reviews than I expected.

I had hoped it wouldn't be review bombed. I have friends and family who worked on this show and they all are very positive with the results."
Ice Fantasy,"Why is this sub pretending this is already some kind of massive failure? 71 MC is not bad. Hell, it's even slightly higher than House of the Dragon."
Ice Fantasy,Why is rottentomatoes site so fucked? RoP and HotD are only showing like 5 reviews
Ice Fantasy,So far it's not a disaster is what I'm getting from the reviews. I'm hoping they can pull it off. Please be better than that Nexflix Shannara series!
Ice Fantasy,"""It either races through astonishing action scenes, or lingers on a single conversation or meaningful look.""

At least they're successfully emulating that aspect of Tolkien."
Ice Fantasy,"From the 'positive' reviews:

>there’s potential in this adventure—even if we can’t see it yet.

> It's the kind of show that deserves to be seen on the big screen instead of on your phone.

> but I also kept thinking that what I really wanted to do was rewatch the movies.

>It’s true, the pace of The Rings of Power’s first two episodes is slow and deliberate

>It may take a while for “The Rings of Power” to sort itself out

> The pace, too, is a little all-or-nothing...in the end, the spectacle wins.

>The somewhat flawed series 

> flutters to life in bursts,

> even if some of that exposition lags... even if some of the effects and epic scale diminish a tiny bit."
Ice Fantasy,It's better than The Hobbit trilogy at least
Ice Fantasy,"To be fair game of thrones season 1 took a while to gather some  to steam 

Problem is you have a very entitled fan base who have decided there is no room for error (which is ironic considering there’s plenty Peter Jackson changed and everyone loves his version)"
Ice Fantasy,Anything has to be better than the Hobbit movies.
Ice Fantasy,Damn. Entertainment Weekly had every exclusive leading up to the release and threw it right under the bus once all the marketing money was paid. Gangster. That means they probably tried to be as nice as possible even in a negative review. Can only imagine Bezo's rage reading that review.
Ice Fantasy,Hopefully it looks like Lord of the Rings and not The Hobbit.
Ice Fantasy,[deleted]
Ice Fantasy,I'm not going to write the whole show off based on two episodes but these reviews don't give me much hope.
Ice Fantasy,"Someone explain to me how you can spend a billion dollars and fuck up this bad. No coherent story line. 2D characters. No back story. The acting was trash. Everyone is saying that it looks good but you can tell it's just cgi. I'd rather watch Amy Schumers comedy special. 

1/10 would not bang."
Ice Fantasy,"I did a double take because I read many of the reviews blurbs in your post before noticing you had sectioned it off as positive at the top and mixed/negative at the bottom. Reason why is many of those positive reviews sound very mixed or maybe backhanded complimentary at best.

I feel confident no matter what happens we should all get out our popcorn for the discussions around this show coming up."
Ice Fantasy,"What you're going to see in this thread:

Cherrypicking parts of reviews to confirm this sub's predetermined opinion that the show is going to fail. They said it looks gorgeous? That must mean the content sucks!

It's been hilarious watching the run up to this and HOTD. It's clear which show this sub wanted to succeed and which one it wanted to fail. The Amazon hate runs deep."
Ice Fantasy,"Who knew that a mega thread of Rings of Power reviews would have so little comment on this sub. Apparently, reddit is upset."
Ice Fantasy,It’s just never gonna beat the trilogy is it? Why bother
Ice Fantasy,Lots of buts in those positive reviews.
Ice Fantasy,"Imagine seeing the shit show of the star wars sequel trilogy and thinking ""Let's do that to Lord of the Rings."" Damn, as soon as I saw JJ Abrams being involved with the show runners I knew this show was a lost cause."
Ice Fantasy,Karendriel is not a great character.
Ice Fantasy,"Most reviews seem surprisingly honest, that it is OK but not brilliant yet - i was really expecting a lot of 10/10 best show ever shill reviews."
Ice Fantasy,[deleted]
Ice Fantasy,"Ick, I love the Washington Post and subscribe to it, but the critic apparently cannot spell ""appendices."" She spelled it ""appendixes"" twice within 4 words, but I would only spell it that way when speaking about the organ."
Ice Fantasy,The last people I would trust to review a movie or TV show is 'critics'... They're always paid shills that are not in line with the general public
Ice Fantasy,Sticking to the writings of the master of high fantasy -Tolkien - whose work they were adapting would have helped. But they chose to write their own garbage plots
Ice Fantasy,"So the writing for the show is terrible as expected and visuals are stunning as expected. Inorder to keep viewers hooked for a high fantasy show like this, the writing has to be extremely good else casual fans will lose interest. The reviews also point out a lack of interesting characters.This show is going to be a major disaster."
Ice Fantasy,"I'm still cautious.

I swear to christ if I tune in and everyone living in middle earth looks like they walked off an instagram photoshoot \*Cough\* Wheel of time \*Cough\* I'm out. Immediately. And never coming back."
Ice Fantasy,[deleted]
Ice Fantasy,"So at best, a Tolkien effort..."
Ice Fantasy,NEVER trust critic reviews nowadays. You'll see a huge variations between critic reviews and audience reviews and the latter is always more on point.
Ice Fantasy,The problem  is it's not meant to run forever and they're gonna wanna run it forever.   So it's literally gonna be a show with the story that goes nowhere with a beautiful background and beautiful scenery and beautiful everything and absolute garbage for story.
Ice Fantasy,"I havem't seen it, but l'll rate it as a solid 7 unicycles out of 5 fleshlights."
Ice Fantasy,"It's September 1st, why can't I watch this yet?"
Ice Fantasy,Has it been posted yet?  I don't see it on Prime.
Ice Fantasy,"I am a huge fan of LOTR since I was a young kid, I was excited for the show. I found it to be ok, I did not love it nor did I really dislike it. I will watch it, but I lost a lot of my excitement during the first 2 episodes."
Ice Fantasy,"Weird wall of text incoming. I took the time to review the sources form above poster my self.

**RogerEbert.com**  
This sounds not that positive:  
""ut you can throw all the CGI money in the world at a series, and it won’t make it more quickly-paced or its characters more compelling. That’s “The Ring of Power”’s major failing in its early go, as its first episode functions as a somewhat dry, derivative prelude, filled with endless scenes of politicking and elves droning on against green screens or elegantly-furnished conference rooms. It’s hardly the most exciting beginning to the series, with a frustrating amount of place-setting and more two-line characters than you can shake a palantír at. ""  
""Really, what hobbles “The Rings of Power” is its teasingly derivative design that evokes Jackson’s trilogy while also asserting itself as something entirely new. The costumes pay homage to Ngila Dickson’s lush outfits for the original films, right down to Sauron’s spiked helmet; Bear McCreary’s classical score feels appropriately big, but doesn’t stand out with the same hummable zeal as Howard Shore’s.""  
Hmm  
""While these first two hours read as a little dry, there’s plenty of promise in the robust world of “The Rings of Power”—hopefully, enough to overcome the stiffness of its prologue.""  
  
The conclusion pushes back to the point there are so more episodes, lets see.  
  
On the Author:  
""He is also a member of the Chicago Film Critics Association and Critics Choice Association. You can also find his byline at RogerEbert.com, Vulture, The Companion, FOX Digital, and elsewhere. ""  
Fishy in the context you will read further down, isn't it?  
  
Seems every single cast of netflix animation series is more diverse than the main authors shared in US top entertainment magazines world.  
Whom could say they have 5 lbs in square miles of waching machines measured by gallon capacity to offer...  
  
No article on season premiere or more.  
  
  
**Digital Spy**  
Basically ""imprint""  
""HEARST UK ENTERTAINMENT NETWORK

So this is an addriven media ad magazine owned by an entertainment company.  
There are also NO negative reviews what so ever on the site and the format/ theming of the ""articles"" is very similar to each other whatever the content.  
  
So this doesn't even counts as an ""opinion"".  
  
  
  
**Collider**  
Although on the About page they claim to some ""editors"" codex or some romantic description of journalism:  
""Collider is the ultimate source for impactful entertainment news. We deliver the biggest, most important industry happenings, and provide deep analysis and sharp commentary through interviews, reviews, and much more. Since the site began in July 2005, we’ve been dedicated to delivering content that is thoughtful, analytical, and all-encompassing, with a tinge of personality for good measure. ""  
The todays ""article"" of todays is a simple descriptive novel, or a high school writedown of the first episode. A textual Rip off of the episode. There is no analytical part whatsoever.  
Even in the pre-release ""articles"" is any analytical confrontation with the material its only ""descriptively explaining"" of what happens to the challenged american mind.  
  
  
  
**Slash Film**  
This site is a real funny rip off of journalism in this entainment block.  
The Article from the pre-release hype is written by Chris Evangelista who  
""Chris hosts the 21st Century Spielberg podcast.  
His work has appeared in The Guardian, RogerEbert.com, Fangoria, Empire Magazine, and more.""  
  
Is a podcaster, yeah. And he also wrote Feature articles for atleast one of the other sites on this list.  
https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chrisevangelista/  
  
The only update article on todays release evolves on a kind of topic and opinion article on the character Gandalf.   
In the first paragraph they celebrate, that it is all so close the original material, while reverting in the 2nd paragraph to the opposite opinion on their ability of deviate from it: ""The Rings of Power"" is not afraid to deviate from the strict rule set of the books (or films)."" .  
Then they state that the visually different guy from that episode is soooo likely Gandalf.  
The only part there we dont read a sum up of the content of the show is there the article concludes on that a probably Gandalf like Character being introduced here is a good idea. And thats the only spot there there is some kind of argumentation on something.  
  
So here is no review of the show as a whole with pros and cons.  
  
And Suprise the write of todays article Marcos Melendez:   
https://www.slashfilm.com/author/marcosviana/  
Is also writing for before mentioned sites ""His previous work includes writing news and feature content for Collider, CBR, and ScreenRant.""

  
  
**Daily Beast**  
The pre-realease article and author seem to be a bit more reflective here.  
It all seems more like someone really wrote some sort of article. There also critical articles can be found, but it hast to be literally like ultra trash to get negative reviews here. See for yourselves if you want to double check on my text by looking in the authors article history there.  
  
From the About Us:

The Daily Beast delivers award-winning original reporting, fact-informed analysis, and sharp opinion in the arena of politics, pop-culture, and power and reaches more than 1 million readers a day.

Pretty cocky statement, if no sharp opinion or heavy analysis in the arena of politics can be found in the first 3mins on their page.

  
  
Part 1 of  X"
Ice Fantasy,How the fuck do you leave an audience review on this?
Ice Fantasy,"I like it alot, can't wait for more episodes"
Ice Fantasy,"The Lord of the Rings is a special, important, serious, and respected story to its fans.  Covering this material is something that invariably carries with it some very high expectations.  Results to the level of the first seasons of Lost or Game of Thrones would be the minimum that would meet expectations here."
Ice Fantasy,"Interesting reviews. I am also of mixed opinion... it is quite far from the stories and takes many liberties, but i cannot confirm that the show seems to be very political, or woke or Galadriel,is now a superfeminist like some paranoid voices claimed.

It has some nice and interesting elements and moments but at other times suffers from bad writing/storytelling/dialogue. So far i think of it as a nice show with too many Taurielisms  and Jarjaromirs.

Galadriel,literally jumping ship? Now please! And where do these humans off the coast of Lindon suddenly come from? Southern Gondor is thousands of miles away! Do they now completely ignore distances and travels like the last and most dreadful got seasons?

So much language and naming is completely off, and these things were of central importence to Tolkien! I'd wish they'd pay more attention to such worldbuilding details! Dwarf women are supposed to be very private and paranoid towards outsiders...  modern personal names have ZERO reason to be used for the archaic second age. Why would an Ainu spirit falling from the Sky speak Quenya?

I liked some other things like the middle-men or men of darkness and the proto-hobbits (no these are NOT Harfoots! Wrong naming again!) , so far it is too early to say where the story will be going...  it wasn't a bad start, but it definitely had its flaws too."
Ice Fantasy,"I'm going to watch and try my best to keep an open mind, but after wheel of time, I have very little optimism for Amazon-produced shows.

That said, the Terminal List was pretty good. I haven't read the books but I enjoyed the show."
Ice Fantasy,"I tried to watch it as an entity removed from Tolkien and with the firm mental reminder that he, himself, hoped for fanfiction. That's the only way I could excuse... well, a lot.

That said, I found it beautiful and thoroughly enjoyable so long as I remembered to keep up my mantra: ""ThisIsNotTheSilmarillion"" on repeat lol."
Ice Fantasy,"It was visually beautiful but how is it so boring?! It's the dialogue that stops everything in its tracks.  Galadriel is not interesting at all, man give her a personality for goodness sake."
Ice Fantasy,didn't stop it rip
Ice Fantasy,"Yeah, megathreads are a necessity for when the embargo lifts for those massive shows."
Ice Fantasy,"I will judge it before I have even read about it or seen it.

8/10"
Ice Fantasy,"Yeah, I’ve seen a lot of praise for the visuals and production values, but not so much for the characters or writing. With how much money and resources Amazon is pouring into this show, it almost feels like this show *needs* to be amazing on all fronts. If the writing truly isn’t anything special, then that’s going to be a huge disappointment. How you can make the most expensive show of all time, and have writing that is anything but spectacular is beyond me. I guess I’ll just have to wait and see for myself, though."
Ice Fantasy,"> The common thread in every interview seems to be that it’s visually spectacular - no surprise there.
> 
> 

seems that based on the previous threads on this show that that is actually a big surprise"
Ice Fantasy,">	it seems like everyone besides LA Times (who got 6 episodes) only saw the first two

Thank you for clarifying this, it wasn’t clear in the reviews I read whether they were reviewing the \*series\* or the first episodes."
Ice Fantasy,"The show also cost a billion dollars, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to not judge it by the same metrics you’d judge a show that doesn’t cost a billion dollars. It’s totally fair to expect it to be prestige television and not just something you turn your brains off to watch and forget the next day."
Ice Fantasy,"> The common thread in every interview seems to be that it’s visually spectacular

It's also worth noting that many of the reviewers saw it in a theater at first where the visuals would really pop. From Sepinwall's review:

>Two episodes is not a huge sample size, and the excitement level of the show leans much more on the spectacle than on the stories. Amazon showed the first two episodes to many critics (including this one) in movie theater settings, the better to emphasize those enormous production values; revisiting the series at home on a much smaller screen, some of the plots felt substantially less thrilling without that visual wow factor."
Ice Fantasy,"Don’t forget the crowd that think something can’t be just good or okay, it’s either dogshit or 11/10 perfection and can’t be anything in between, which is what this show probably is"
Ice Fantasy,"> The division is at whether the plot, writing and characters are any good, which is more or less what I assumed would be divisive from the very beginning

Respectively the last person I would want to judge plot or writing is entertainment journalists

If the show is a hit they will ALL flip the narrative quickly. 

Some of them I'm sure have valid criticisms/praise but their are just so many bad ones that, whose gonna bother filtering it all"
Ice Fantasy,It's impossible to judge the plot etc with only two episodes so it makes sense that most reviewers are hedging their bets.
Ice Fantasy,">The common thread in every interview seems to be that it’s visually spectacular - no surprise there.

I mean, based on the number of redditors calling the show cheap-looking based on the 2 minute trailer, I'm sure that is a big surprise to them."
Ice Fantasy,"The fact that 2 whole episodes are just worldbuilding already says a lot.

Fellowship of the ring was a bit more than 2 hours and managed to tell whole story and you need 2 hours for just worldbuilding? Tells me you are a bad writer."
Ice Fantasy,"And I think the LA Times hits on the disconnect. This is a TV show, the format leans heavily against epic. It's not going to be like a LOTR movie any more than Disney + Star Wars TV shows are like the movies. Some may like the TV format, while others will feel it's butter spread thin across too much bread."
Ice Fantasy,Didn’t all critics only get the first two episodes?
Ice Fantasy,I don't think he meant it as a compliment
Ice Fantasy,Whooosh
Ice Fantasy,It's not really based on Tolkien's real work though. They're making most of the story up because they don't own the rights to The Silmarillion.
Ice Fantasy,"Did any dialogue feel stilted to you, or did the majority of it feel like it would be at home in the LOTR trilogy?"
Ice Fantasy,Would you say it’s better than the Hobbit?
Ice Fantasy,"> with not really impressive writing (especially when compared to HOTD),

Honestly high fantasy seems harder to write than low fantasy like HOTD. You don't have the same opportunity for grey characters and actions. Making wholly good and wholly bad characters interesting is difficult."
Ice Fantasy,">Missed some of the warmth of the LOTR films.

Can you elaborate?"
Ice Fantasy,"Were the two episodes screened as two seperate episodes, or was it edited into a ""movie""?"
Ice Fantasy,1-10??
Ice Fantasy,"> AMA I guess.

who do you like?!"
Ice Fantasy,FOTR spends it’s first 45 minutes in the Shire
Ice Fantasy,"Little too slow that's two episodes that are over an hour long, it's more like bad writing than a slow burn."
Ice Fantasy,I couldn’t get through the first episode because of how hard they try to throw you in. It’s just a massive chunk of badly written expository dialogue. They simply have no trust in their audience to be able to understand things without narrative hand-holding.
Ice Fantasy,These millions could have been used better - at least make something special with it. If you are going to make a shitty show dont spend that much.
Ice Fantasy,By reviewing the two episodes.
Ice Fantasy,That's a film's length worth of story.
Ice Fantasy,"I hate that it's even a thing. Either review each episode individually or the full season.

It's baffling just how misleading/pointless critic scores are for TV shows. IMDb shouldn't be the only way to get a clear consensus on a shows quality."
Ice Fantasy,"Showrunners know the first episodes is make-or-break for the show's success, so they HAVE the put their best on those. If even those are bad, there's almost no hope for the rest. Nevermind two episodes, the first 10 minute gives good prediction as to how good the show will be.

With that said, its all up to personal taste. A lot of times when the criticism is slow pacing, I never have a problem with that. I like slower pacing, because it allows me to feel closer to the characters and the setting."
Heavens Garden,"I'm not all too familiar with the texts you're describing but the parallels with certain aspects of Judeochristian religion and symbolism are already pretty clear, I think we all got the Garden of Eden vibes from Mother and Father. I can't wait to see where it goes."
Heavens Garden,[deleted]
Heavens Garden,"A couple points that I think need to be addressed based on your OP,

>HBO's Raised by Wolves is based on The Book of Enoch, specifically The Book of the Watchers. These deal with an extremely early take on creation that likely inspired modern judaic-christian beliefs. 

I'm not sure if this is a semantic issue that's just splitting hairs, or what not, but 1st Enoch / The Book of the Watchers, did not really inspire Judaic beliefs in the sense I take your meaning. 1st Enoch dates to, at the earliest, the 4th century BC during the intertestamental period (if not later). Conservatively, Genesis, the book that Enoch takes its major themes from, was complied many centuries earlier (conservatively from c. the 7th century BC, with likely *much* earlier sources). Though 1st Enoch was popular with both Jewish and later Christian audiences in the intertestemental period to around the 3rd century AD, and is referenced in New Testament epistles like 1st/2nd Peter and James, these references generally concern the Nephilim (as you mentioned) the flood event, and demonic agents. But most of these elements can be found in Genesis (Nephilim are mentioned in Genesis 6), and other, earlier, non-canonical/intertestimental books.

The spear of Longinus is, of course, a legend that arose from a passage in John 19, which post-dates Enoch by a couple centuries. And perhaps most significantly, ""Lucifer"" is never mentioned in the Book of Enoch. Rather, the adversarial agent in Enoch is named Azazel (though later Jews and Christians associated the two as the same being). Finally, the Antichrist is not detailed in any significant way in Enoch, rather he's likely initially referenced as the Little Horn in the book of Daniel and developed in the NT.

I think you definitely have the right idea that the show is borrowing heavily from a number of ancient sources, including the canonical Bible, apocryphal/pseudepigrapha and later Rabbinic and Christian legends, and obviously outside Mythraic, and other mystery religion sources, but Enoch is only one of the many sources that Ridley Scott and company are picking up on.

For more on the subject, I HIGHLY recommend the works of Old Testament scholar Michael Heiser, specifically his books The Unseen Realm (or its condensed version Supernatural), Reversing Hermon, and his blog and podcast called The Naked Bible."
Heavens Garden,"The last time that I remember such a hybrid of sci-fi and religion getting such a heavy mix, even though the religious parts were much broader, was Battlestar Galactica. And I love BSG. I hope this can be as good with even better special effects."
Heavens Garden,"If you guys think *Raised By Wolves* is a wild sci fi intergalactic religious focused piece of art

Allow me to introduce *Dune*"
Heavens Garden,I saw a comment on this sub where someone felt the inexplicable need to point out that the wolves in the title is a metaphor. And I think about that comment a lot. That's either some of the most brilliant dry humor on this subreddit or every shoe that guy owns has velcro.
Heavens Garden,The name of the religious order seems to relate to the Roman cult of Mithras as well. Very little is known of them since they were removed by early Christians.
Heavens Garden,"I really like the Show so far. But i fear it can go full ""Helix"" any second now.

A Show (helix) that showed extremely high promise during the early episodes and then went down a completely idiotic path.

Focusing on the Colonizing and survival in a ""Enemy Mine"" esque atmosphere is what keeps me interested. Imperfect AI vs Religious Extremists in a realistic universe. I would like to see how that plays out over time. What their advantages and disadvantages are and how they chose to cooperate or fight each other. Its Neat and its Small. Perfect for telling stories.

If it becomes Mythology driven, if there are too many little Mystery Boxes. If Supernatural or Prophecy Mumbo Jumbo start to dominate the plot i strongly believe that i will lose interest. Your Post is not giving me much hope since it may appear that the writers simply want to tell a religious story in a different setting. 

But we will see, so far i like the show, but i do have my reservations that it can go either way."
Heavens Garden,"All of that stuff about orphans/creating orphans, and fake Marcus being a false prophet... and yet no mention that fake Marcus created an orphan himself? Paul. They killed his actual parents. Paul, who is now bonding with Campian."
Heavens Garden,That first quote just sounds like a strung out new parent
Heavens Garden,This is the kind of theories I am craving. I am OBSESSED with this show. It is some of the best sci fi we have gotten in a LONG time This and DEVS are real treats for sci fi lovers
Heavens Garden,"I was skeptical but a lot of this does seem to be at least loosely lining up, especially if the 'temple' winds up being some kind of prison.

One thing i definitely found interesting reading the Wikipedia page about the book of Enoch is a line that goes on about something like a desert or dying land and mentions holes everywhere, so I'm getting more on board with the ridley Scott weird lol."
Heavens Garden,"a great read, specially after the last episode of the first season."
Heavens Garden,"I had imagined (although not quite as far you!) something to this effect. At least the idea of the world having already been inhabited. Those holes look like ""moholes"" that I read about in the ""Red Mars"" series. It looks like the world had been previously terraformed."
Heavens Garden,"Incredible post. I knew nothing about the book of Enoch or watchers. Going to look more into this tomorrow, but I wanted to quickly bring up the new idea of dark photons. 

Although Scott didn’t write this, he did direct it & it was heavily inspired by Alien. Also this is not some Prometheus prequel/ sequel lol 

So let’s think of mixing these religious beliefs with scientific beliefs.

Azazel = is imprisoned now in large dome for experimenting with dark photons 

Earth = experiment to see if humans will self destruct. If proven - they will send their coding / Sol for them to create technology to bring them back to Kepler so that they can evolve using dark photons 

Hybrid Offspring = Mother’s Baby

Dark Photon theorists believe it’s the 5th force of the universe holding it together. 

“
 If dark matter is a previously unseen kind of particle, then it's perfectly reasonable to suggest (because we have no idea if we're right or not) that it comes packaged with a previously unknown force of nature — or maybe a couple, who knows? This potential force might let dark matter talk only to dark matter, or it might intertwine dark matter and dark energy (which we also don't understand), or it might open up a new communication channel between the normal and dark sectors of our universe.
“

Will add more on this tomorrow! Let me know thoughts!"
Heavens Garden,This is some NGE shit and I think it would be too far to do in live action.
Heavens Garden,"If you’re correct then I’m glad Ridley has a place to explore this. The Alien franchise was the wrong place in my opinion, I absolutely despised what he did with Covenant."
Heavens Garden,"Man, these are some of the biggest stretches I've ever seen. Nephilim aren't the sons of gods and women, they were angels mating with women. God is on a whole 'nother level, and that's ignoring the Trinity."
Heavens Garden,"Nice. Also looking forward to the big 'Foundation' adaptation.  


Jared Harris in The Expanse and now Foundation!"
Heavens Garden,"A nephilim thats half man half angel would be an unclean spirit when it dies. A demon is the disembodied spirit of a half animal half angel, or as their mentioned in the dead sea scrolls,talking monsters capable of dreams."
Heavens Garden,"Ridley Scott didn't actually write this though, did he? He isn't even directing most of the series. Aaron Guzikowski who wrote the 2013 Denis Villeneuve film Prisoners is writing this. So much analysis for this new show but hardly anyone is talking about him. All of this stuff is presumably coming from his brain. He is a catholic from Massachusetts who is apparently not very religious anymore. Not sure why he would dive so deep into this sort of thing. I am actually going to take a look at some of his other work because Prisoners was great."
Heavens Garden,"Having not seen the show but remembering this post, how correct were you?"
Heavens Garden,So is Campion comparable to Jesus or a Nephilim?  Lol
Heavens Garden,I like it.
Heavens Garden,I’m very lacking in my religious info so this post really peaked my interest. I wish I knew more to draw conclusions for myself
Heavens Garden,"I just love RBW because it is a somewhat original sci fi project not based on a comic, toy line or pre existing franchise."
Heavens Garden,"Some interesting ideas for sure, and maybe some will come to pass, though Ridley Scott isn't the writer, just the director for the first two episodes. Aaron Guzikowski is the writer for every episode (so far)."
Heavens Garden,.
Heavens Garden,"Come discuss this show with us at the new sub r/RaisedByWolves!

We're merging with a couple similar subs to create a central hub for fans. Get in early and be a part of the conversation."
Heavens Garden,To me season 1 felt more like Garden of Eden and Noah's Ark then The Book of the Watchers. But I don't think you're wrong with the reveal of the hooded figure I think season 2 could be themed on the Watcher Angels.
Heavens Garden,"Just finished watching it in the UK on Sky Atlantic. From the finale, I too got massive biblical themes. The serpent and garden of Eden and fallen angels."
Heavens Garden,"Cambian= Ishmael

Heavens Garden,"Just to point out, the book of Enoch is widely-rejected as canon in the Judeo-Christian beliefs.

I've only heard of bits and pieces of it, but it is a rejected book and not a part of the Bible."
Heavens Garden,"My impression was that it was loosely inspired by Metropolis. It definitely has obvious visual inspiration there with the look of the necromancer, but also some of the story seems to be an adaptation. The two opposing factions, the importance of the children, Mother's two identities, and so on are all modernized re-imaginings of ideas in Metropolis given a new Ridley-esque take on that story.    
    
The religious take wouldn't really be out of character for Ridley Scott, though, and it could certainly be both."
Heavens Garden,"So I know this is from s01, but… Have y’all gotten to s02e07 yet??? Because the part about Azazel cultivating an antichrist… 🧐🧐🧐"
Heavens Garden,It reminds me very much of early gnosticism.
Heavens Garden,Y'all should check out the VALIS trilogy by Phillip K Dick. Some sci-fi theological stuff goes down
Heavens Garden,"I love everything about this show, including your theory."
Heavens Garden,"I'm inclined to believe this simply because Ridley Scott is involved. Most of his projects make use of religious allegory, and reference esoteric religious concepts."
Heavens Garden,[deleted]
Heavens Garden,"I agree, nicely written"
Heavens Garden,"I didn't feel informed enough to comment without watching the show, but as someone who has delved heavily into the apocrypha, I'm glad someone else brought up the lack of Lucifer or an antichrist in Enoch."
Heavens Garden,"And if we look at Aslan in Narnia we can compare it to the description of Adam in Genesis of being made in God's image, indicating that the Judeo-Christian Yahweh and the Narnian Aslan are not the same character. Yet *The Last Battle* we see that there is a war which causes the apocalypse, indicating that we are living in the end of times and that the Antichrist is-!! (theism intensifies)"
Heavens Garden,"All of this has happened before, and will happen again... And again..."
Heavens Garden,Have you ever watched the OA? It's very different in vibe but goes really deep into sci-fi and religion. It was canceled but the first two seasons are amazing.
Heavens Garden,At the end it comes down to personal preferences. I like my scifi science based instead of it using motives from the Yahweh myth. I wouldn't be interested in scifi stories based on Hinduism of Greek mythology either.
Heavens Garden,Pretty excited for dune. Reading the book again with my kids prior to movie release.
Heavens Garden,"I literally bought the book yesterday lol. Let's do this. I need some good weirdness this year already, god damn."
Heavens Garden,"I am very, very, very worried about Dune having been split into two films. 

Had they filmed both back to back like LOTR and released the two halves a year apart, I would not be concerned at all - but since the second part hasn’t even been greenlit (or written) yet, there is a very real and very strong possibility that we end up never getting the second half. And even if it does happen, it will be YEARS before we get to see it. Assuming we survive that long..."
Heavens Garden,So you're telling me there will be no wolves of any kind?
Heavens Garden,I'm wondering if it is low-key an alt-history where Mithras beat Christianity (which is probably fun world building as much as it is a way to avoid using a real world religion)
Heavens Garden,"Where are you getting this? First Enoch predates Christianity by a couple centuries at least, and the group associated with Enoch's writers/audience was Second Temple Jews. Christians didn't get rid of any group associated with Enoch, and it can still be found in the Eithiopian Orthodox canon. Nothing found in Enoch has anything to do with Mithraism."
Heavens Garden,"You are describing exactly what JJ Abrams would do.

Dude loves his mystery boxes."
Heavens Garden,"You hit the nail on the head. 

I’m on episode 4 myself and very intrigued by the show, but I am not at the point yet where I would recommend it to my friends."
Heavens Garden,"""The last thing the world needs is a forever Amy"""
Heavens Garden,"I watched the first episode sort of with half I terest but it was super clear and repeated the division between science and mythology.   Like....mom had a deep moment with the kid...""science!"""
Heavens Garden,"Paul definitely is a candidate, but not a nephilim as far as I know. Technically speaking all the children alive in the show are now prophet candidates, so expect this prophet to be chosen by the process of elimination. This post was more about the Enoch connections, I didn't even touch on Mithras or some of the other names—like Paul. Maybe next week."
Heavens Garden,Just a cracked out redditor.
Heavens Garden,What’s DEVS?
Heavens Garden,"Devs was great, but the whole determinism concept was very tame in comparison to dark on Netflix"
Heavens Garden,Thanks!
Heavens Garden,"That was my thought after reading all that. 
I just watched NGE for the first time a couple months ago. Still recovering."
Heavens Garden,Funny cos the alien stuff was my least favorite part of that movie. The god complex and the paradise lost parallels were my favorite parts
Heavens Garden,He directed two episodes but he's not running the show.
Heavens Garden,"We are agreeing on what nephilim are. Angelic offspring, yes. I argue Jesus was also this, just an especially important one given daddy was big daddy himself. Even then, I'm arguing that within the framework of the show and Ridley's history with the idea as shown in works like Prometheus."
Heavens Garden,"Isn't the Trinity a christian invention?   


Waay after the Book of Enoch?"
Heavens Garden,"Wait, who's doing a Foundation adaptation??"
Heavens Garden,"I singled them both out at the end. Given Ridley has tossed these ideas around for decades and is a producer, I'm going to include him with Aaron when talking about these ideas."
Heavens Garden,"Time will tell, but it seems I was right to think along lines of gardens and snakes though. There are a batshit insane amount of allegories at play, and I still think Enoch is one of the larger, overaching themes of the show, but within the first season I think I'm mostly incorrect to single it out as the most prominent story. I also expanded on these thoughts after the finale in another thread I made, which is currently pinned in my profile.

In short, I hit some marks and missed others. Still too early to say by exactly how much. However I was 1000% correct to insist it was going to get biblically weird for an otherwise science fiction show. Check the show out and see what you catch, always curious to hear and talk more theory!"
Heavens Garden,"Watch it.  It's worth it, a thinking petson's sci-fi."
Heavens Garden,That’s what I’ve been wondering too. I supposed in a way he could be both. Jesus as in the savior who comes to lead them all from the darkness. Nephilim - admittedly a bit of a stretch but - in the sense that he was born of man and of machine because he wasn’t carried & born by natural gestation & birth.
Heavens Garden,Yeah this is somewhat dated at this point and was just my initial take. Developed a bit more [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbywolves/comments/j391ls/raised_by_wolves_mithraic_mysteries_and_season/)
Heavens Garden,"Eh, I don’t really see Hunter as that. He’s more of an evolving character that is continually growing, learning & changing."
Heavens Garden,What's your point? The book of Enoch relates to the bible but was removed.
Heavens Garden,"Now do it again with season 2 out... got mad christ vs. anticrhist vibes from that final episode... wooden cross effigy and upsidedown floating crucifixion...

I dont know much about religious weirdness so would love to see you theorise and connect the dots again"
Heavens Garden,"The more the storyline continues, the more this poster’s theory rings true. I can’t wait each week until Wednesday comes around so I can get my new episode!😁"
Heavens Garden,"Even if you're right, that's not what oxymoron means."
Heavens Garden,I also agree and I want to be a part of this too
Heavens Garden,"Could you maybe unpack this a bit? It's been awhile since I read The Chronicles of Narnia, but Aslan is certainly a typology of Jesus, who is identified within early Christianity as the second Yahweh figure of Second Temple Judaic texts."
Heavens Garden,I have not. I think what's stopped me is knowing that it didn't get a proper ending. But I plan to eventually watch it regardless.
Heavens Garden,I would be more excited if it was a TV series. My fear is most of the political/religious plot will be wiped away to fit a movie format.
Heavens Garden,Its a book!? Seriously loved the trailer alone. Looks phenomenal and beautiful and stunning and now i hear its a god damn book? Payday soon and i will be ordering one for sure.
Heavens Garden,"It is a very, very good book. Read up to God Emperor at least - it’s all prologue for God Emperor where the real climax of the story is.

And it is very weird in a great way. It’s rare to have books that deal with timespans of hundreds of thousands of years."
Heavens Garden,"Same. Really just because of COVID. 

On the bright side, it leave the door open to a trilogy which I think is/was the lowkey goal."
Heavens Garden,Gosh darn false advertising.
Heavens Garden,It could be. I thought something along those lines but didn't have enough evidence to build any solid theory
Heavens Garden,"I didn't mean to imply that the book of Enoch had anything to do with Christians or Mithras. I was only stating that the order from the show are called Mithraic, and that seemed to associate, or at least, be derived from either the Roman cult or maybe even the Iranian God of Light."
Heavens Garden,"I always felt like Rian Johnson got a bad rap for The Last Jedi. The Force Awakens was filled with J.J. Abrahms' legendary mystery boxes that he clearly had no idea himself on what to do with them like he *always does*.

J.J. Abrahms is a great idea man but he does not know how to follow through."
Heavens Garden,I keep wondering if it will fall apart like lost or if it had answers at all
Heavens Garden,"The first one was really not all that great i agree. Im a huge sucker for hardish SciFi so i continued. Im at #5 now and as i said i like the show, it can still go in either direction and so far me is entertained. But as i said, i see worrying signs that it can go ""helix"". (What a disappointment that was! Im still salty about that show)"
Heavens Garden,"I'd agree that one of the big strikes against Paul's potential candidacy as ""space Jesus"" is the missing Nephilim/AI connection.  We know that fauxMarcus is aware of the prophecy and Paul's unwitting potential to fill it- given that his character arc seems to be moving from committed atheism, to opportunistic ruse, to likely drinking his own koolaid, it's possible they're setting up Paul as the false Prophet's false Chosen One.  (Seems even more likely when they juxtapose blue eyed, blonde Paul next to the darker-skinned dark-haired Champion.  One is the common but false image, the other the 'real' thing.)"
Heavens Garden,Devs is a show on fx/Hulu. It’s complicated to discuss without spoilers so just check it out
Heavens Garden,"Everything and nothing. Kidding. It’s an amazing show on FX/Hulu written and directed by Alex Garland. If you’re a fan of Deux Ex, Annhilation, Dredd 3D, or just Alex Garland’s approach to artful hard science fiction in general it is a can’t miss show with brilliant performances from its leads."
Heavens Garden,What’s NGE?
Heavens Garden,"That’s fine, I can understand that. I went into it hoping for more body horror and Alien and instead got Androids times two: electric boogalo, and was thus disappointed. It would be like going to see a third Blade Runner movie and the entire middle section is about a literal monster perverting the human form. With a new series unconnected to existing franchises there isn’t that expectation."
Heavens Garden,"What is an angel? It's a messenger of God. By definition God is not an angel, hence, even if his Son were not Himself, said issue would still not be nephilim."
Heavens Garden,Apple TV
Heavens Garden,"Really, REALLY thinking you hit the mail on the head with at least 98% of your allegories. Especially now in the second season with so many things falling into place as they are so far? Aw yea. Definitely. And now that I read your post last night, I started rewatching a few episodes of the first season to see the storyline thru that lens and yup, there it was, all laid out perfectly LOL!"
Heavens Garden,"Please forgive my ignorance, but what does the dodecahedron have to do with it? Like, what’s it’s significance, what does it mean?"
