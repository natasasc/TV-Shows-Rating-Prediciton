The Young Pope,"Just FYi, Paolo Sorrentino (the showrunner/director of *The Young Pope/The New Pope)*'s latest feature film, [*The Hand of God*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_1VW_0i6vo)*,* is up on Netflix, along with an 8-minute BtS. I'd also recommend [*Youth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxwqrRmRbYk) if you can find it."
The Young Pope,"every scene was worth it just for the framing. And cardinal Voiello was the best, his funeral speech for the poor Gerolamo moved me to tears"
The Young Pope,I liked their intros.
The Young Pope,sorrentino is a genius
The Young Pope,"Yea The Young Pope is really good. It's really unlike anything else. The style, music, and themes really hooked me. I did enjoy the New Pope as well but not as much. Remember hearing something about it being planned as a three-season series but not sure if a third season will ever happen."
The Young Pope,"I hope there's a lot of jude law. I loved season 1 even though it got really confusing towards the end. Aesthetically it was great, I loved the sincerity of his prayers despite not really believing himself. There was some beautiful scenes in the show, really beautiful"
The Young Pope,"one pope, two popes,

new pope, young pope"
The Young Pope,"I had all but given up on this show. It’s hard to believe it’s been 5 years of a cliffhanger. Really liked it, even though it tended to make me really uneasy. It was really unique and well made."
The Young Pope,"What the hell is this show about, I've tried looking it up and can never find a clear explanation. My friend kept recommending me to watch it, but refused to explain anything further than it's about an American pope"
The Young Pope,I hope his accent is not as bad as it was in Billions.

The Young Pope,"I was so split by season 1, not sure whether I'm up for season 2. There were some phenomenal scenes, and the performances were top-notch, but so much just didn't seem to pay off or come together in the end. Will definitely give the first few episodes a go..."
The Young Pope,"I try not to read about shows before watching them, but from the commercials/Reddit I have no idea what this show is or trying to do. Is it historical or real at all? Is it alternate reality? Is it exposing pedophiles?"
The Young Pope,Question: Does this Pope still fuck?
The Young Pope,What did you find confusing about the end?
The Young Pope,"One Two Popes are here before you

Just go ahead now

Pontiffs, Pontiffs who adore you

That's what I said now"
The Young Pope,This one has a bubble car.
The Young Pope,[deleted]
The Young Pope,Dogma and hierarchy. Game of Popes.
The Young Pope,"It's about a pope. A young pope. Also a dick pope. But maybe a Saint pope? One things for sure, he's a sad pope."
The Young Pope,"Alternate reality, and it doesn't expose pedophiles as much as it ships them to Alaska."
The Young Pope,Watch season 1. It’s about a Young Pope. It’s about self discovery. Watch it.
The Young Pope,It is not about making a representation about popes.
The Young Pope,"As the season went on I enjoyed it more and loved it more, although I would have loved to see more of Diane Keaton. The 9th episode might have been the single best standalone episode I have seen up until that point. Cardinal Gutierrez was beyond amazing and Lenny's letter and final speech were both amazing."
The Young Pope,"Well [spoilers](#s ""he saw his parents then passed out seemingly dying. Also his hard-line super Conservative mysterious to keep people into the church stance went away and it wasn't exactly clear why. A lot of episodes didn't really flow into an over arching plot besides that the church's answer to child sex scandals was to send their bishops or whatever they're called to alaska."")"
The Young Pope,"Marry him or marry me

I'm the one that loves you baby can't you see?

I ain't got no future or a family tree

But I know what a pontiff and lover ought to be

I know what a pontiff and lover ought to be"
The Young Pope,So it's rooted in reality then
The Young Pope,"That's great, but what did you find confusing about the end?"
The Young Pope,Nothing it was /u/dnirtyone that was confused. I just love it.
The Young Pope,"> do you even go to this school?

>> no i just have a lot of feelings"
The Young Pope,"Jude Law playing a pope in an Italian surrealist television program

The trailer was in no way indicative of what it is but it's tremendous nonetheless "
The Young Pope,"""In the meantime, would Your Holiness care for a regular diet coke?""
""Let's not utter heresies, Domen"" - new response for when the waiter asks if Pepsi is okay instead 

"
The Young Pope,i really enjoyed it when he dressed like beyonce in that fancy hat
The Young Pope,Poor Sister Bice - she just wanted to wanted to make His Holiness a nice bowl of pasta e fagioli for lunch...
The Young Pope,Did anyone else remember halfway through that Jude Law is British and completely NAILED the American accent?
The Young Pope,"I have seen it all. I am distressed by the amount of people online who refuse to even watch it because they see it as ""just another period drama."" Please. Please. Please I beg you to watch it. Just do it. Ignore the memes. Ignore the people who make fun of it. It is the best show I have seen in a really long time. It is surreal and beautiful. Think of if David Lynch directed House of Cards and set it in the Vatican. The characters are superb. The acting is incredible. Basically the only thing they are struggling with is the fact that people turned it into a meme without even seeing a single episode. Its unfair to the people who frankly created a work of art."
The Young Pope,The director of Young Pope says that it's a study of a loneliness. Keep that in mind and you're in for a good time.
The Young Pope,"Disappointed with reddit's lack of response to this show, though it seems like that may be partly due to all the reasonable subreddit names getting stolen.  I thought it was pretty interesting, though most of this first episode was setting a groundwork for the rest of the season."
The Young Pope,[deleted]
The Young Pope,"I loved the first episode. It was just so weird, I can't tell if it's supposed to be a drama or a comedy. "
The Young Pope,It's not a perfect show by a any means but I would definitely call The Young Pope the most interesting show to come out in a long time.
The Young Pope,"This episode was great. Captured me so well I didn't believe it when it was already over.

I really enjoy the directing. It reminds me of the Hannibal TV series. 

Everything from the acting to the script was superb. Pope Pius XIII/ Lenny is greatly interesting; Jude Law is really bringing intrigue and charisma to this role. I'm really enjoying all the other characters also. 

Very entertaining so far. I can't wait to watch more."
The Young Pope,It's like Twin Peaks landed in the Vatican.
The Young Pope,I'm gonna be really disappointed if the show doesn't just degenerate into Jude Law crushing puss every week.
The Young Pope,"2 episodes in, I think I like this show but I also just don't get it. It's very strong stylistically, and I think I understand the kind of show it's TRYING to be, but I'm not following a good bit of it.

The dialogue is very strange, almost but not quite to the point where I would say it's bad. Parts of it seem like they were written with a huge amount of creative license as far as how the Vatican operates. Lenny's character seemed in episode 1 like he was going to be this crazy power scheming evil genius antichrist figure, but by the next episode he's fuckin around with kangaroos and plates and shit. Like, I think I get that they're going for ""he's a micromanager and nitpicker over everything"" but at the same time it's like, why do you think that I think those are the most interesting parts of his character? And this relationship with sister Mary is weird and kind of ambiguous whether he wants her around or not, he's kind of hot and cold with her and I don't get what that's about.

What I do like about it is that it feels not at all formulaic. The directing is very good so far as well. It's just weird given how spectacular HBO's high concept, high budget dramas have been with GoT and Westworld how this show feels a bit off the mark."
The Young Pope,"Man that opening scene seems like it came from one of my favorite jokes...

What's worse than a pile of dead babies?
The live one at the bottom trying to eat its way out."
The Young Pope,"I already saw the whole series and I loved it. Very weird, but the writing gets better with each episode and the acting/music/cinematography are excellent. Been super into that Andrew Bird song too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgTF_fNuzXQ"
The Young Pope,[deleted]
The Young Pope,"I liked when Lenny said, ""it always comes back to her, doesn't it?"" while looking at a statue of Mother Mary over the body of Jesus. That was great symbolism for the relationship between Sister Mary (same name, and possibly actually his mother? He calls her Ma in a flashback) and Lenny. She may be the real string-puller."
The Young Pope,"This show immediately hooked me with Lenny's speech in the beginning. Then it turned out it was a dream, and boy was I disappointed. It turns out Lenny is an ultra conservative megalomaniac. Or something. From this episode, I have no idea what this show is trying to do. That speech in the beginning was the show I wanted and I really did not recover from the disappointment that this show is not going to be that."
The Young Pope,Yeah I'm not sure what we'll get out of the conversations when every comment is from someone who's seen the entire season already 
The Young Pope,Anyone else get the second episode tonight?
The Young Pope,young sister mary is hot
The Young Pope,"I don’t want to make too much of it, but I see parallels between this and *High Plains Drifter*:  stranger comes into town, confounds and abuses the locals and they, at least on the surface, acquiesce as he takes over with a dwarf as his second.  Jude Law even sounds a bit like Clint Eastwood.

edit: And he has a cool hat.

"
The Young Pope,Best new show of 2017.
The Young Pope,"I have admittedly seen more than the first episode (don't worry, no spoilers) but even from the beginning, one gets the impression that the Pope is psychologically, if not damaged then at least heavily affected, by his past. This could work out well for the series, but it may get tiring after awhile, as would the Borgia-esque focus on the machinations of the church."
The Young Pope,"I loved it. The directing style is definitely odd, but I got used to it and by the end it felt like a perfect fit for the story being told."
The Young Pope,I don't know what to think. I hated the first episode of Westworld (for different reasons) and ended up loving it so I might see what episode 2 offers.
The Young Pope,I get the impression that this show is really trying to be artsy. Regardless I enjoy it
The Young Pope,It really reminds me of Micheal in The Godfather becoming the Don
The Young Pope,"Finished watching the entire 10 episodes and I have no idea what this show was trying to be. I was sold by first episode, got confused by 1st, and as it went on I hoped there would be a twist or at least *some* change. But intsead it kept devolving. 

I mean they portray Lenny as literal Christ's second coming or something and then he makes amazingly evil decisions that are then contradicted by his personal behavior. 

I kept thinking maybe it was some sort of an ingenious plan, but really the show is just an awful mess with amazing characters and a pathetic plot. "
The Young Pope,"This pilot was amazing. Bizarre show but I'm sucked in. I love the memes, but I was already in on the show months ago when I saw the trailer. If anything, the memes enhanced the show for me"
The Young Pope,It reminds me of the political intrigue in King's Landing.
The Young Pope,"~~Just finished~~ two days ago I finished the finale and I'm still thinking about this show! It's beautiful and funny and perplexing and stunning and heartbreaking and satisfying. I don't need to know if there's a second season coming, this one was perfect."
The Young Pope,"I think that most of you, if not a majority, can remember a time where you knocked on someone's door believing that they were there but they did not answer.  It made you want to be allowed to enter even more than when you approached the door; correct?  This is the message, just as his curiosity of his parents, that he believes is true.  Perhaps just because of his hippie parents?"
The Young Pope,"I was really hyped because of the reviews that this was going to be absurd and delicious. However, I found the first episode to be very....disjointed. The dialogue seemed downright awkward a lot of the time, as if it had been translated badly into English. The character introductions were abrupt and, not being Catholic, I had a hard time following some of the stuff. Most of the music I found intrusive rather than complimentary to the scenes. Yet I'll probably continue with it though to see if it smooths out."
The Young Pope,Auto downvote if you say anything negative about the show. Glad r/television is so open minded.
The Young Pope,https://twitter.com/stodgeoff/status/817089489864654848
The Young Pope,Really enjoyed the series. Jude laws performance was amazing. I watched several episodes a couple of times and picked up on things l missed each time. My favourite episode was the second last one I watched it three times it made me cry each time. Am I satisfied with this series not having a second? No. I thought they fast tracked a bit too much and needed at least a couple more episodes to end this series. I'm glad I watched it because I would have never known how to say quick sand in Italian! That's my go to word now!
The Young Pope,"Watched the series already as well, decent 7/10 TV. The odd style will be hit or miss for some."
The Young Pope,"Kind of reminds me of Trump..... That bastard.

I am enjoying the show, not Trump though."
The Young Pope,"I dunno.  After sitting through Falling Water, I don't know if I have another surreal show in me right now."
The Young Pope,Can someone explain the scene with the pope and Monsignor Bernardo Gutierrez?
The Young Pope,"For me, the most interesting bit was when he imagined boobies. Really the rest of the show was very boring and confusing. Do you need to be Catholic to really ""get"" this show?  "
The Young Pope,The promo for this show was so awful I decided I don't want to watch this show.
The Young Pope,"> surrealist

It's not really surreal. At most it dabbles a little into magical realism with the sainthood aspect, but 99% of the time Sorrentino is playing it straight.
"
The Young Pope,But Pepsi is superior.
The Young Pope,It was Diet Coke not Pepsi 
The Young Pope,"Even if your server understands the reference, they will still think you're a douche. You will get a light laugh and a what else can I get for you? Meanwhile they hate you inside. Pick something else you self righteous prick.  "
The Young Pope,Dat hat was practically heli-proof.
The Young Pope,Her crying really set the tone for him. What a dick!
The Young Pope,He sounded so much like Chris Pine
The Young Pope,"Really?  This is my #1 issue with the show so far.  While he definitely improved from episode 1 to 2, I still hear a lot of mistakes and a great deal of effort/struggle with the hard consonant sounds.  Sounds like a young Prof X."
The Young Pope,He really is an amazing and underrated actor. 
The Young Pope,Fuck. It never even occurred to me. 
The Young Pope,British actors are fantastic at it. 
The Young Pope,It's not even a period drama. It's a drama. It takes place in the current time. 
The Young Pope,"The House of Cards comparison really does a huge diservice to the show. I've already seen people calling it ""House of Cardinals"" and I wish they would know how wrong they are. Actually, it actively subverts the clichés you would expect from a typical political drama in several ocasions, I could provide examples."
The Young Pope,"I've finished it too, absolutely sublime series."
The Young Pope,"That's the thing that treally got me about it... at first I thought the writing was kind of too ambiguous and vague. I liked all the characters, I just wasn't really into what was going on. That completely changed and by the end I loved it - but what really roped me in was the beauty of how it's directed and edited. The music and all the technical aspects contribute to it being dreamy and there are just some truly beautiful and moving sequences throughout the season, and especially in later episodes. It made me feel a lot of profound emotions. Amazing soundtrack and tone."
The Young Pope,"> Ignore the memes

Woah, slow down there sir!"
The Young Pope,">equating David Lynch and Paolo Sorentino's style

slightly triggered by that tbh"
The Young Pope,The main thing I didn't want to see is that the Pope would be an antagonist protagonist like Frank Underwood or Walter White. I'm tired of that type of character already. Do I have anything to worry about in that regard?
The Young Pope,"This makes me sooooo excited for the show, thank you!"
The Young Pope,"Question, how did you see the whole series? "
The Young Pope,"You have any more info on what the creator was intending? I've been googling for answers, cause I loved the show but had no idea what the hell the author was trying to say. It feels like the television equivalent of an epic Murakami novel."
The Young Pope,[deleted]
The Young Pope,thats insane. what could that persons reason possibly be?
The Young Pope,A divine comedy.
The Young Pope,I'll be waiting for it every week just like Westworld and GoT
The Half Brother,"My grandfather was a member of the easy company. He joined as a replacement just before they got to Bastogne. He wrote in a journal through the entire experience and I have memories of him typing up all of his handwritten journal entries onto a computer in the early 90’s. 

Stephen Ambrose used a lot of his personal reflections as reference material for his books. Unfortunately, he passed in 1996 but when the mini series premiered in 2001, HBO flew my grandmother, mother, and her sisters out to Paris to join for the premiere in Normandy. 

I am so extremely proud to be his granddaughter and wish I had more time with him to ask questions as I was only 6 when he passed. My husband and I took a trip to Bastogne and the Jacques Woods/Ardenne Forest in 2016 and it was incredibly emotional and surreal! The fox holes are still there and the energy is hard to describe. 

The series is so well done and I feel so lucky to have something I can watch whenever I want to remind me of everything he and his peers went through at such young ages."
The Half Brother,Band of brothers is one of the few series I’ve watched multiple times. I absolutely love everything about it.
The Half Brother,"Want to see me cry like a baby? Play the interviews at the end of the last episode, ending with Major Winters “… but I served in a company of heroes.” 😭"
The Half Brother,"The moment that sealed it for me was after the Bastogne campaign, where they’re all sitting in the church and listening to the choir. As the names of the dead and injured are read out, they start to slowly fade away one by one…"
The Half Brother,"“Masters of the Air” about the strategic bombing campaign is airing on Apple TV+ this year. It’s the third in the trilogy produced by Spielberg/Hanks: BoB, the Pacific, and Masters of the Air."
The Half Brother,"I rewatch it every year, absolute masterpiece!"
The Half Brother,"Sobel may have been the asshole he was portrayed as in the show (though fwiw his family have come out and very publicly claimed he was not) but he did not deserve what happened to him in real life, suoer tragic"
The Half Brother,"It was a great example of something only HBO could make. Some stories are better told as mini-series as well, but they are so expensive to make that we just avoid making them in the US.

Netflix burned a lot of bridges the last 4 years when cancelling many of their series. It has become such an issue many folks won't give Netflix series a try as they don't want to get invested only to be left with no closure. They should move to doing mini-series for a while to regain trust and tell the stories other networks won't invest in telling because of no multi-season/franchise potential."
The Half Brother,Just thinking of the Bastogne episode makes me cold.
The Half Brother,"Watch Generation War next.  It's from the German perspective and hits even harder.  

Don't sleep on The Pacific either, obviously.  All three give their own unique perspective of the war."
The Half Brother,"I'm almost 100% sure that this is the case, but I can't believe this hasn't been mentioned: 

If you're a BoB fan, the podcast that came out at the 20th anniversary, is absolutely incredible. It enriches the experience for both new and old fans by an insurmountable amount.

I've been rewatching the show almost yearly since it came out but rewatching it with the podcast as a companion was a new level of appreciation.

Absolutely everyone of importance and nostalgia is interviewed, the host is sneakily good and intelligent and warm, he is able to facilitate such good conversations with cast and collaborator.

I CANNOT. Recommend it enough:

https://open.spotify.com/show/4kPks2or9xa26GdMRRu2lK?si=PvRdPyLoTJSsPQXbW8QvIA"
The Half Brother,Generation Kill is equally as good but in a completely different way
The Half Brother,"The thing that got me was the pre-episode commentaries by the actual people being portrayed in the show. It really shows the accuracy and perfection of the acting and the show production value.

I really need to watch BoB again. What a ride it was."
The Half Brother,"The opening sequence of Episode 2, with hundreds of airplanes in the sky at once, really made me understand the concept of ‘nations at war’ at a deeper level, the sheer scale of the conflict and resources involved"
The Half Brother,"We need /r/television version of this:

After many years I finally decided to watch [insanely popular, well-reviewed film] and I just want to say that it definitely holds up after all these years! What really stood out was the amazing directing by [Academy Award Winning Director] spot-on acting decisions by some of the legendary cast including [Academy Award Winner], [r/Movies fan favorite], and [actor identified as ""underrated""]. The story makes a grand arc with clever plot twists and a satisfying classic finish, back at the start never to be the same. If you're a fan of [Top 10 IMDB Film], or [Other Top 10 IMDB Film], or any [insert genre] films in general, I cannot recommend this movie enough."
The Half Brother,It probably *is* the most incredible piece of tv ever made
The Half Brother,Really going out on a limb here
The Half Brother,"most shows & movies have the disclaimer: ""Based on a true story""

BoB's disclaimer: ""This is a true story""

""The Pacific"" is just as incredible.  it doesn't follow the same characters throughout, but it does show the literal hell these extraordinary marines went through ( I salute ALL my Devil Dog shipmates!)

& I'm writing to Tom Hanks at least once a month to finish the trilogy, tell the stories of my shipmates in WW2.

plenty of source material: Pearl Harbor, Midway, Leyte Gulf, USS Indianapolis, Doolittle's Raid, the formal surrender on USS Missouri"
The Half Brother,"^^^this^^^^

I’ve been saying this since I first watched it.  I’ll take shit for this, but I truly believe that Band of Brothers should be required watching in high school.  We all take our freedoms for granted.  And to think that many of these brave young men even faked their age to be eligible for service."
The Half Brother,I just watched it recently and it was absolutely incredible. Although i’ve heard that it may not be as accurate as it’s portrayed and maybe Winters wasn’t the all around great guy he’s portrayed as.
The Half Brother,"I hadn't watched it either until recently and echo your sentiment. I liked that they also weaved in some uplifting sentiments and the cameos from the actual soldiers which was touching. ""Uplifting"" framing in I watched it right after *Come and See* in the WWII binge, which was pretty brutal."
The Half Brother,This is not an exaggeration.
The Half Brother,"It never stops being good, it’s one of the few shows that is consistent over every single episode"
The Half Brother,First time I watched it I was on a mini R&R break in a random palace on the Green Zone in Iraq as a member of the 101st Airborne Division. I was hyped to say the least.
The Half Brother,"The episode “Bastogne” always has me like “f-ck that shit!” Frozen trees exploding from artillery impacts left and right, dude in the foxhole next to you getting a wood splinter though his throat dying choking on his own blood. Id’a noped outta there like a coward."
The Half Brother,Move to Generation Kill next
The Half Brother,"It is the best miniseries I've ever seen. And easily one of the best TV shows of all time. I think every American should watch it at some point in their lives, even if they have no interest in history."
The Half Brother,"It's truly special, one of the perfect examples of right people, right time, right medium, right network.

Basically all of those ducks had to get in a row, they did and it created magic. I'd have to think on it a bit, but if you argued it's the best television series ever, I wouldn't tell you your wrong as a gut reaction."
The Half Brother,"So fucking good.  I have watched it countless times.  I always remember the DVD being expensive for a long, long, long time.  One of the very few things media, movies, TV, whatever, which brings me to tears.  Especially when they come across the concentration camp.  Everybody's acting is top notch.  Whoever cast David Schwimmer as their lieutenant, wow.  It still surprises me to this day how good he was at being so unlikeable.  Now I want to watch it again."
The Half Brother,"Band Of Brothers is one I can watch over and over and over again.  Never gets old.  Wish there was more WW2 films that was filmed like this.  Even though Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg both did Saving Private Ryan, this just takes the cake."
The Half Brother,"I'm going to give the heads up that Pacific is not the same. It's really good and you will enjoy it, but it's not band of brothers and I think it's something to do with the source content being multiple books rather than 1 as in the case of band of brothers. 

Highly recommend the book, some subtle things in the show that are highlighted in the book (hinkel,eat ze armpit ya!)"
The Half Brother,"Salute the rank, not the man."
The Half Brother,"I Treasure a remark to my grandson who asked, ""Grandpa were you a hero in the war?""

Grandpa said, ""No.... but I served in a company of heroes”.

By Mike Ranney

I have watched this scene more times then I can say and it always makes me tear up.."
The Half Brother,"The YouTube algorithm randomly suggested an interview with Major Winters a few days ago - turns out Albert Blythe didn't succumb to his wounds from Normandy but rather he recovered fully and then went on to serve as a paratrooper in Korea.

https://youtu.be/vfhcwvsUkBY"
The Half Brother,One of the best ever. Check out Catch 22 on Hulu if you haven’t already.
The Half Brother,The book is also great.
The Half Brother,"Thanks for posting. I've never seen it, but I'm going to give it a go."
The Half Brother,Was thinking about picking up the vhs box set. Never seen it before.
The Half Brother,"Just started  a “The Pacific” rewatch. If you haven’t caught it, it’s worth a watch."
The Half Brother,The pacific is a must watch for you then
The Half Brother,"A great series that has visually stood the test of time. Is it a perfect historical depiction? No, but its very close, and certainly much closer than a lot of what we get today.

What always floors me is that the musical and visual presentation of the series still fits and doesn't look dated at all. The washed-out, high contrast, gritty style combined with the lower framerates during action sequences really works well to keep the series in the same ring as modern CG movies and shows. Hell, it even sometimes surpasses modern film and TV by being primarily in-camera effects, and leans on CG very sparingly. It doesn't show its age because of that, and the style really embodies the ""1940's WWII"" feeling so it never feels out of place.

The same argument can be said about Saving Private Ryan, though I do feel it's visual timelessness is just slightly second place to Band of Brothers. Still incredible, but just not quite the same.

Again, it's not perfect. But it's pretty damn close!"

The Half Brother,"You’re not wrong, but man, I wish Reddit would find another show."
The Half Brother,"Yes, the show with a 9.4 on IMDb and numerous Emmys is pretty good. Shocking."
The Half Brother,Man just caught up with the TV discourse from 2001
The Half Brother,Ross and his friends at Easy Company
The Half Brother,Yea this post doesn’t say anything new or different.
The Half Brother,I’ve actually been rewatching it and fully agree.
The Half Brother,I rewatch this yearly and discover something new every time. Amazing series
The Half Brother,the GOAT
The Half Brother,*the most incredible pieces of TV.
The Half Brother,We watched the entire series every Christmas season.
The Half Brother,Your weekend pass has been revoked!
The Half Brother,I’ve always said it’s the greatest single season of any show ever. It just can’t be topped.
The Half Brother,I was a sobbing mess when the final credits rolled
The Half Brother,"If you like band of brothers, try “Generation Kill”. Also excellent television, and I think a great counterpoint to BOB."
The Half Brother,"Oh def. It's saving private Ryan as a series but like full quality throughout. Great choice to watch.

Edit: not to say SPR isn't quality throughout, just that doing it as a series is a lot of time to be quality and they do it."
The Half Brother,From the Earth to the Moon
The Half Brother,"The Pacific is just as good, though more miserable. But it should be. The pacific theatre was hell on earth. 
Fully realized with Fat Man and Little Boy. 

Though I’ve heard it put that war is worse than hell. The people in hell deserve it, but in war innocent people are killed and brutalized wholesale."
The Half Brother,it really truly is a cinematic masterpiece <3
The Half Brother,"Watch the Pacific too then. You’ll love it. Although I watched pacific then BoB, and found myself catching things I learnt from Pacific, which made some scenes a bit less realistic in BoB.  

Also, just saw “all quiet on the western front.” Wow. Def watch that too"
The Half Brother,"If you are a gamer, you would enjoy r/hellletloose. It appears the developers were fans of the series and used it for inspiration."
The Half Brother,"I loved the series as well. Back then, I had no interest in war movies or shows. I always viewed them as just action movies that were all about shooting people with nothing much happening. When I gave Band of Brothers a chance, I immediately understood the gravity of war from their points of view. I then branched out to other war stories and games and I learned that there's a lot of very interesting stories to learn about in them."
The Half Brother,I loved Damien Lewis (Lt Winters) in it. BoB made me watch Billions and Homeland.
The Half Brother,"Not one of, The One!"
The Half Brother,I will never ever forget the medic episode.
The Half Brother,"One of the best shows ever. I rewatch it every year. 

I live in Zell am See, the place where they go to relax in the last episode... Always makes me smile to know they were here at the end."
The Half Brother,"Band of brothers is something I take the time to watch every year. 

It is that good."
The Half Brother,Yeeeeah man absolutely fantastic show
The Half Brother,"Friend recommended it about 3 years ago, one of my comfort shows. Along with The Sopranos you cant go wrong.

War is Hell"
The Half Brother,Episode 9 is one of the best and most hard hitting bits of TV ever
The Half Brother,You'll be watching it again in a week. It's one of those
The Half Brother,"Band of Brothers shows the totality of war. The training, the preparation, the fact that soldiers don't like being left in the dark. The lengths they will go to to survive, and how respect is earned and lost in the field. 

There are few other movies that show this. Saving Private Ryan is one of those few. War should never be shown as pretty or noble, war shows the worst of mankind, and also humanity at it's best.

If you want to see another series similar to BoB, check out The Pacific. Also, a Swedish band named Sabaton does a lot of songs based on history and warfare. Check them out, as they have taught me a lot more about European history than my high school history ever did."
The Half Brother,This post reminds me that I'm long overdue for a rewatch of Band of Brothers as well as The Pacific. It has to be years at this point.
The Half Brother,Bastogne was the best episode
The Half Brother,They show clips from BoB in some Army schools as examples of good leadership and it’s assigned as homework to watch the entire series. It’s an inspiring and moving show.
The Half Brother,"The Pacific is equally good and made to the same impeccable standard, its about the US war in the Pacific Islands and conveys the same weight of human cruelty and perseverance. Band of brothers will always be the GOAT of these types of shows but I must say I think i prefer the Pacific"
The Half Brother,Chernobyl is right up there with it and is by the same people both are amazing
The Half Brother,"Now watch The Pacific, it's even better."
The Half Brother,I want to enjoy military tv series or movies but i cant... Because all the soldiers wear the same uniform and i cant tell who is who.
The Half Brother,I cry everything when I watch episode 9 why we fight
The Half Brother,"The top of my bucket list is to visit Bastogne to honour the memory of the men depicted in this mind blowing series that always hits me really hard when I watch it

To the men of easy company - thank you ALL for your service."
The Half Brother,We all experienced this the first time we watched it.  After you’re done you’re almost exhausted by the emotional rollercoaster and wonder if you can ever watch another show.  Very few others are as immersive as this series.
The Half Brother,"In my opinion, there are two mini-series' that exist that are perfect, and couldn't be improved upon in any way.  Band of Brothers, and Lonesome Dove.  Just gimme a bottle of bourbon and a blu-ray of either one, and you've made my weekend!"
The Half Brother,"Yes, it really is excellent."
The Half Brother,We have  watched it every memorial day for the last 15 years
The Half Brother,"Amazing mini-series, I rewatch it every now and then. You should watch The Pacific now! Just like Band of Brothers but a bigger focus on the horrors of war rather than brotherhood."
The Half Brother,"It was great Jimmy Fallon was really believable.

As I’ve gotten older, and as the unfiltered stupidity of war comes out of places like syria and now ukraine, I have a hard time understanding the fascination people have with war media. It’s almost all moonshine."
The Half Brother,Literally just watched the last episode for the 20th or so time.
The Half Brother,"It is very good.  I also think that ""Das Boot"" is a masterpiece. (1981 or 1985 versions)"
The Half Brother,"Great show, I’ve rewatched it more than a few times. The only part that takes me out of it all together is when Jimmy Fallon shows up in a Jeep and doesn’t even remotely try to act."
The Half Brother,Hot Take but I think The Pacific was the better HBO series
The Half Brother,To me it is a great show that belongs in history. Watching Americans portrayed as relentless good guys in 2023 makes me question all the history I have learned. How many My Lai stories were covered up to create this spot less victory?
The Half Brother,Just heard there is a new series coming out based on airborne troops
The Half Brother,"I mean it's good but it's not incredible imo.

If I was American maybe I would feel differently because of how patriotic it is but it's not all that tbh."
The Half Brother,"For the time, yes."
The Half Brother,Love to say insane things like “I’m a big fan of WWII” What on earth does that mean? What kind of person is a fan of war.
The Half Brother,"it portraits the war as something to admire not be disturbed by it ,it doesn't show the warcrime that are pushed apon all soldiers that have to fight"
The Half Brother,"That and chernobyl are the best things on hbo imo.

And they should be ashamed with the pacific. Literal ass pedaling as a sequel. So bad."
The Half Brother,"The book and author are great things to look into, it's also amazing that the story is basically true. And after you finish it, watch the Pacific War. It's not as good but it comes across as a more horrific war than B.o.b. 

I ponder what we have learned from their sacrifice. I'm an American, both of whose grandfathers were in WW2. And here we are lining up with Russia and China filling in the familiar roles for a terrible repeat for my son's generation. One of my gf. was in both wars, the other trained to go to intercept Japanese transmissions behind the lines but fortunately the war ended before they sent him. I believe Ukraine is destroying Russia before they become too powerful, can we avoid fighting China for world supremacy and to preserve democracy. Let's hope we do better this time."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Decent work by Netflix, although some of the acting wasn’t great, well done overall! 

Please more Netflix you have my money."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,I'm not sure what series you are talking about but if you want to know more about Islamic empires then check 'Kings & Generals' YouTube channel. They've made a few quite in-depth series of videos about multiple empires from all over the world.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I don't know what that show is but you better be able to.

The Ottoman Empire is complex beyond words. The empire was around for about 800 years and covered about 700,000 square miles that stretched from the Middle East to Central Europe."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Yes
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"i hope they move to another story

i think it's a really cool concept where they can tell the history with the actors but set up all the details with narration and interviews

it saves writers the trouble of doing all the hardest parts

depending on how quick they make these, they might be able to do napoleon before spielberg's hbo series"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,If only they could create a piece of furniture where I can put my feet up while sitting down on my couch
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,[deleted]
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"the Crimean War - World War 1 and shortly after is pretty interesting, you get to see how the empire falls apart with inept leadership and the rise of the repugnant Young Turks"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,[deleted]
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,eh true
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Just finished binging it, wow I loved this series. The acting was superb, the making of mini-doc revealed how carefully they constructed the details and considered the themes, and I am always excited about seeing women centered media (director, writer, costuming, story, actor, etc).

I disagree about the flashbacks being distracting. Often they connected to memories that Esty experienced while navigating new directions in her life. As the film approaches a climax (what will happen with her life) more is revealed about exactly how her past was so traumatic. It shows us what is at stake, why she is fighting for a future.

For the criticism from Orthodox community and reported inconsistencies, remember this is the story of just one specific community/sect of Orthodox Jews, and this can be used as an allegory for many different people's struggles."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"This story of a young Hasidic woman who wants to leave her cloistered way of life is both heartbreaking and uplifting as it pits her courage and determination against the cruelty and arrogance of the insular and ignorant Hasidic community. If you thought the Hasidim were repugnant and obnoxious after watching the Netflix documentary ""One of Us,"" the dramatization of the true story in ""Unorthodox"" will not change your mind.  


One important correction: The subtitles repeatedly read that the Hasidim are praying in Yiddish. They do converse in Yiddish, but for Jews, including most definitely the ultra-orthodox Hasidim, the language of prayer is Hebrew. For those of us who know the difference, in ""Unorthodox"" the Hasidim are indeed praying in Hebrew. The film is correct but the subtitles are wrong."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Just finished. This blew my mind. Sooo moving.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,does anyone know the name of the DJ group in episode 3?
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Just a heads up. A lot of Orthodox Jews are a little annoyed at the series for exaggerating Orthodox, and specifically Hassidic, life. The allegedly non-fiction book that the series is based on was also found to have some problematic inconsistencies.

On an unrelated note, Shira Haas's Ruchama was my favorite character in ~~*Schlissel*~~*Shtisel* (up until her weird boyfriend storyline)."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Can anyone tell me about what was happening in the kitchen in the scene where she suspects she is pregnant? It looks like lots of surfaces are covered in aluminium foil.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Last write-up in this series for a while. Will probably still be posting random stuff on here just won't be watching any new shows for the next 3-4 weeks. Hopefully within a month I'll still have my life and health to continue doing these. 

Next shows I'll be doing when I'm back at this should be Little Fries Everywhere. Also I'm making a 'Top Teen-Dramas of All Time' listicle for some reason idk. 😪

Anyways, stay safe guys!"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Thanks for the list and the review of this series.  Now I have something to watch since I finished Tiger King.  BTW is that one not in the list because it is to new?
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Catnapp. The soundtrack for the show is on Spotify
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I haven’t seen the show (only the trailer) but OF COURSE Orthodox Jews don’t like it. The Hasidic community is extraordinarily inclusive and they don’t want people knowing how dated their beliefs are, especially when it comes to women."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I tried to watch this show, and I'm not even up to anything controversial and can still see why. There's just an underlying disdain for them that makes the show really hard to watch."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Wow, I went down a rabbit hole of the debunking articles....

Reading that she wasn't really educated in that community, her family apparently supported her going to Sarah Lawrence, and she lived a more liberal Orthodox lifestyle than she claims, changes things. She actually had the kid while she was still married, and didn't leave until he was 7.   The real story sounds far more interesting!!

Shame she felt she had to craft a cookie cutter story to make her story more compelling to outsiders."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"The show is called Shtisel, btw"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,I mean...they would say that...the point wasn’t to portray them in a good light...
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Ruchami’s boyfriend was everything her father wasn’t, and she craved the sense of domestic normalcy missing from her home life."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"That scene takes place during the holiday Passover (which lasts for eight days). Part of Jewish practice in general is maintaining a kosher (""clean"") kitchen. During most of the year this includes separating the meat and dairy etc. During Passover, however, this includes getting rid of all of the chametz (leavened bread). The aluminum foil is to ensure that no chametz from the rest of the year gets on their food/their food during Passover is clean. Some people will do a full spring cleaning for Passover but foil works too."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I believe they were fasting and she was feeling extra hungry because she was pregnant and the food was tempting her,  but she had to wait until the grandfather finished praying to eat."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Have you seen Skam because if not your list won't be accurate.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I know I'm responding 3 months later but if you want something even more crazy than Tiger King, try Wild Wild Country."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Insular*
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Well sure, there's no shortage of scandals involving that community....but apparently the book is fiction. 

I think she feeds off really dated and unexposed beliefs about Hasidim too, and they're rightfully sensitive to that."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I mean, there’s that in Christian fundamentalist (big love) shows as well. Fundamental religious communities do not treat women well, and the protagonist in the show is a young woman. If the main character was an elderly patriarch in the society the tone likely would read different."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"They talked a little about this in the ""how it's made"" portion after. They said that since the author was so well-known in communities surrounding this subject, she wanted to give Etsy a different life than her own. They wanted the discussion to be about the character, her story, and the Satmar community, not about the author. 

Because of this I get the sense that she weaved together a narrative from a lot of different experiences of people who left."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear. I was actually wondering about the aluminium foil. I read somewhere else that is to do with keeping the kitchen kosher."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Of course I have lol. Top 3 teen drama!
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Yeah, inclusive is literally the opposite haha"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Big Love went out of it's way to show them as real people, not caricatures to scorn. That's a great example of a show giving humanity to it's characters. You could argue too much.

I mean, if it's from the perspective of someone who is young and doesn't offer that, and the writers wanted to stay true to that, then it's not great source material."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Would like to point out that Big Love was not based on Christian fundamentalists... it was based on Mormon fundamentalism.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I think it's also because the real person is problematic, and her stories didn't check out. Why else would they downplay the unique parts of her story and go with some generic cardboard cut out version of a person leaving a traditional community? 

I mean, what really happens here? She isn't happy, she has a mother that's left, she goes to find her, she makes some friends and finds herself drawn to an artistic outlet and gets an opportunity most do not, and during it all, her naive possibly autistic husband chases after her, finds her and gets rejected. In the big scheme of diabolical ""leaving the religion"" stories, nothing happens. The bit with the brother abducting her and the gun, is insane, and if it happened no doubt that was scarring, but then he ultimately walks away, he doesn't actually try to bring her back to NY."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I’m talking about the “fundamentalist community” in Big Love which is out in the desert, which were basically the villains of the show, that the main characters escaped from. The ultra-orthodox Jewish community depicted in this show is an insular fundamentalist community the main character escape from."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"No kidding, but aside from generically assuming all fundamentalists are the same, your comment has little value. Even among Hasidim there are different sects and traditions, and they feud. Some are more liberal while some oppose rock n' roll.  If there's no awareness or depth, then it's just saying ""boo religion"" or ""boo ultra orthodox Jews"", and that's boring unless you're predisposed to hating entire communities and want to feel validated in your hate."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Okay lol but the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal, they’re depicting a young girl being forced into marriage and forced into sex. 

So what are you trying to say in context of this argument. I’m not saying all religious communities are like this, but the specific story being told is of a community that is. So why should they treat that community with any reverence? If the acts they’re depicting in the show are brutal

And it’s not Jewish specific. A lot of fundamental communities of every religion, even the Amish, have groups that mistreat women and chalk it up to “religion” and it’s no excuse

I would harken back to “big love” - the community out in the desert in big love is not progressive, they force teen girls to marry the prophet, and are not treated kindly by the show at all. At the same time the main family in Big Love is shown empathy, even though they’re still a fundamentalist bigamist family, because they’re not doing inhumane things like the community out in the desert is. 

If this show was about a progressive Hasidic community that was treating young women kindly, why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

Should we just not tell the stories of women mistreated in fundamentalist communities for fear of sounding “boo religion”? This goes for Amish, catholic, Mormon, Scientologist, Islam, Jewish, whatever."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,">the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,

Right, does the show bother to explain that?

Also, I'm not claiming to be familiar with her story, I'm reacting to just attempting to watch the show.. but she apparently really went to liberal Orthodox schools earlier in her life, so the depiction of the family isn't entirely accurate.

I see dramas about terrorists that deal with Islamic fundamentalism with more respect and depth.  I see more care with depictions of the Amish community (though improvements could be made for sure). The idea isn't to give reverence but to give characters depth, and that's what makes people interesting, and can influence societal change when it's eye opening.

As opposed to just gawking and demonizing. The fact that you're comparing this story to ""marrying the prophet"" cult like behavior from a group that splintered from the mainstream, is a problem. Big Love carefully explains who the group are and their stature with the more mainstream LDS church. It's a major plotline. 

\>why would the main character even flee in the fist place?

That's ridiculous. People leave religious families they're born into all the time.  I'm on her side with that (unless it's fiction, and a couple seconds on google suggests some of it was). And it's a common narrative in tv and film and theater. It's told all the time. But if you just have one dimensional stereotypical characters, you're not learning anything from that, it's not really exploring the predicament, it's just trying to expose bad people with an agenda against devout religiousness. In this case people think because they got a glimpse into homes they've never seen before, that's sufficient to make up for the lack of depth and humanity in the community it portrays. You can do that and still ultimately show people are wrong."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"**People leave religious families all the time but they don’t have to “escape” them as is shown in the show. Notice I said “flee” not “leave”. The story depicts an “escape” not just someone turning their back on religion** 

And in regards to the memoir the show was based off of, if you asked me and my mom to recount an argument we had when I was a teen we would both give wildly conflicting stories. That doesn’t mean either of them are “fiction”, it just means the people involved had different justifications and motivations to act the way they did. 

I believe the author that this is her side of the story, and that’s what’s portrayed in the show. Her side, her perspective, her interpretation of how she felt. No one can spin that and say it’s “fiction” unless you’re her.

It sounds like you just can’t handle any attack on a segment of Judaism, because my interpretation of it is that this community depicted in the show is very much a fragment of the larger Jewish community in Brooklyn, and they do not all engage in abhorrent behavior like forcing a young girl into sex slavery (aka, “marriage”), but for the people who are, their story is worthy of being told. 

It might not be “marrying the prophet” but it’s forcing young girls into reproductive slavery all the same through societal and financial pressure. These things are happening, in our country, and we have no obligation to give the people perpetrating them “depth” of character. 

**People using religion to keep women (and LGBT) down are the villains in today’s stories. So, it’s not an attack on religion, it’s an attack on the excuse and bastardization of religion.** 

In our post-post modern society religion has been torn down and disproven as a source of absolute “goodness”. Catholic priests molest children. Female genital mutilation. Honor killings. Etc etc etc etc. But we’re still holding reverence for “culture”. 

“Women in Saudi Arabia are stoned to death for having pre-marital sex” 

“Well, that’s their culture”

Or 

“I had to have sex with the producer for this role” 

“That’s just how Hollywood is” 

**is no longer an excuse the public will permit**

Now, we’re dismantling tradition as a source of absolute “goodness”. Just because your religion/community/ has customs and traditions to uphold, does not mean they will be permitted in the modern world. **Shame, and telling the story in a negative light, is one way of expressing the contempt for “traditions” that do not fit into contemporary human rights and ethics, rather than glossing over violations because we feel it’s not our place to critique**

Side note: the show does not hold the orthodox community in distain for their differences; the way they dress, language spoken, or traditions. The elements of the show that put a negative light on the community are strictly the scenes that portray human rights violations."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,">>the fundamental sect depicted in the show is not liberal,
>
>Right, does the show bother to explain that?

You're right, the way they wrote the show I totally thought Esty was fleeing a liberal Hasidic sect 🙄"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"The movie literally has Yael explain the unique nature of the community. I know this was 12 days ago, but coming into this discussion from the outside, it seems like you are gathering evidence to support your conclusions."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,One of the most beautiful posts I've read in a long time. Spot on.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Well said!!
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"You don't have to flee an orthodox Jewish family. 

Leaving any family, for any reason involving lack of acceptance, is difficult.  It's a story. If you can't handle a real life complicated depiction of these communities because you just want to bash people, then that's boring.

There is no perspective that can account for a fictional story. 

Her mom was easy to locate and didn't leave when she was a toddler, for example. 

Calling aranged marriage ""sex slavery"" is an extremist viewpoint, in my opinion. Totally dogmatic. Arranged marriages are still fairly accepted in some communities. I've known Indians, and Arabs who accepted their parents arrangements and as horrifying as it sounds at face value, they're happy. Sex slavery is a real thing, please dont' make light of it to feel better about the Netflix show you liked.

Look, some Satmars are nuts, but this isn't a story about one of those victims of nuttery. It's not sexual reproductive slavery or whatever dogmatic bullshit opinion you came to the show pre-formed. And cut the crap, you do care about their traditions which you just called human rights violations. You are Othering these people. It's a step away from claiming they fuck through a hole in a sheet. There are plenty of bad things you can say about Satmars, or any fundamental religious folks of any stripe, but again, in 2020, show they're humanity and stop the caricatures that re-affirm horrible stereotypes, and stop pretending you just watched a show that justified your jackassery biases."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood, went to Sarah Lawrence, and stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,My conclusion is the show had an underlying disdain for the community that was hard to watch.... to which people defended it by expressing their disdain for the community. Just stop.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"**It becomes sex slavery, and a human rights violation, when you do not give a woman the means to support herself outside of her reproductive capabilities, and only give the path of being a wife. Which is what is depicted. Raising a child from birth for the sole purpose of them becoming a wife and mother. The women are not even allowed to play musical instruments for fun in the strict rules of the community.**

The avenues allowed to them are to be a wife, or as in the show, run away and be ostracized from their community. Which leads to the “leaving/fleeing/whatever” people being homeless, since they have no real world skills or means outside of their insular community, also depicted in the show. 

**That’s different than an arranged marriage, which i never said was a bad thing or a human rights violation**

Not giving women the option to choose their path in life, and raising them from birth with one end-goal (wife/mother) is a human rights violation, and raising them with the purpose of them being a reproductive servant. I.e. sex slave. So no, it’s not a reach.

**And it’s not “jackassery bias”. If a new cult was raising girls for the sole purpose of becoming a bride, raising them from birth, and forbidding them to learn skill or a trade that would be bona fide sex slavery. Just because this is a sect of Orthodox Judaism doesn’t change that. That’s why I’m saying contemporary society will not tolerate “but it’s our tradition”, if it’s not ethical in the modern world it is not ethical in your old-fashioned society.**"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,An arranged marriage can be a form of sex slavery for someone who is pressured into it and someone who doesn't want it. I'm not saying that all arranged marriages are like that.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,">She did actually live in a more liberal neighborhood... stopped wearing her wig while still a Hasid.

This is something you used as an example of liberalism 😬

>The point is, there are more liberal sides of the community and more dept than the cardboard cut out version you ate up because you liked that underlying disdain in the show.

I think Hasidic Judaism is a fairly problematic worldview, yes. I am aware some sects are more or less problematic than others, but they're all problematic to some degree. Note I didn't say all Judaism is problematic, I said **Hasidic** Judaism is problematic, in the way I believe all fundamentalist religion (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.) is problematic. 

Are you saying no Hasidic Jewish sects whatsoever reflect the depiction? None at all? Because that's really the only way your argument has validity. Otherwise, it's actually showing what some Hasidic women live through, and that's a story worth telling even if it isn't Deborah Feldman specific story."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Criticism isn't disdain and you've clearly got some personal issues regarding the ability to rationalize differing opinions. I know exactly what happened, I just read through it all. You're wrong."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"You told me you think I didn't respond well to the show because it involved Jews.... which is unintentionally your admission you liked it because it's critical of devout Jews. Too late.

You're not describing ""slavery"" or describing what goes on in Orthodox communities in New York.

It's fine that some of you liked this show, but not fine that in defending it,  you reveal really bigoted presumptions that this show just validated for you."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"She agrees to the marriage and thinks it's what she wants.  Sure arranged marriage can be forced, but that's not what is depicted. She lived in New York, she always had the choice to lead her own life, which is what she did."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"No, it's something this dumb ass series used as an example of her shedding her traditions for a liberal secular life. 

I doubt you know much about Hasidim and that's the problem here. What's really being depicted there that's so outrageous or unique to any Hasidic sect?  I hate all the Jewish characters in the show, including her. You don't have the first clue what they live through, because you projected it, nothing horrible happens in that film that's real or is commonplace. You can't possible think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction or have a brother in law pull out a gun. 

You can't defend this show by saying there are Hasidic stories worth telling...sure, but I'm criticizing this one."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Disdain is disdain. The series is presenting harmless everyday observances as if they're oppression. The Redditor I was conversing with took it farther. There's a point where criticism isn't an opinion and treads into bigotry.
You jumped into this because you sympathize with hating Hasidim apparently, and that's wrong. You're a clown."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Lol... I said that because when i compared it to other fundamentalist religious representations (big love) you acted like Orthodox Jews were supposed to be exempt. 

So girls in orthodox communities aren’t raised to be brides and mothers? Oh my mistake then. I live in Brooklyn, i don’t see any orthodox women having a job or running a trade. 

But I guess that’s just not “based in reality” and it’s all “my bias” 

**i’m against any fundamentalist community; Amish, Mormon, Jewish, that raises girls to be mothers with no other avenues. Or raises men to be fathers and tells them being gay is god’s mistake**

This is exactly what I’m talking about, you cannot claim people are being “biased against a culture” when they point out human rights violations within that culture. Something which is unethical is unethical even when cloaked in religion. 

Maybe the VAST majority of orthodox communities empower their young women, but you cannot negate the small percentage of those who are suffering.

And just to say it louder 

In case you didn’t hear 

**raising girls explicitly to be wives and mothers is a form of sex and reproductive slavery. If a community is guilty of that, i don’t give a fuck what religion they practice.**"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Just flipped through your recent comments, all you’re doing is calling people biased against Jews for watching this show on a bunch of different threads, weirdo - when you didn’t even watch it yourself ? Wtf is your problem the character are less “one dimensional” if you watch more than 10 minutes"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I don't think all Hasidic women experience sexual dysfunction, neither do I think many of them pull out guns. I never thought this and no one here believe the show is making these insane blanket statements except you.

It's clear you are projecting because you are making blanket statements about all viewers based on what you're worried they think.

You like blanket statements so you think everyone else does as well.

Projection."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,I'm jumped in because you're psycho
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"None of your rant is in the show. None of it.

No small portion of the show featured the Hasidic sects rituals...criticism of their beliefs to the point of ridicule beyond what the show is depicting is pretty blatant of you. 

Who the hell thinks Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust? Piss off."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I've since watched the series. The fact that it set people full of vitriol like yourself off on hate rants speaks volumes. 

The Jewish characters are all unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated.....and it's supposed to be representative of a Jewish community? If that's normal to you its because ...well, you already went on a bigoted rant."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

You forget what you already admitted earlier in this thread."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"What's psycho is getting upset that some Jews grow their sideburns out. Which is really what that person used as an example of xenophobia.

You jumped in because you dislike some Jews."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"**how can you say that none of my rant is in the show when the central problem in the show is hte main character was raised to be a wife and mother, and doesn’t know how to support herself outside of her community? That’s the whole show. Her trying to get a scholarship because she has no real-world skills and no money. That’s the WHOLE plot**

No one said “all” ultra-orthodox have this experience, but if this is this person’s story who are you to tell them it’s problematic/false? 

Many fundy communities fall into the same trap of womb worship. If that’s not YOUR experience in them, then good for you, but you cannot say others share your experience.  

And i think it’s you who can “piss off”. Have fun setting women back 200 years with your pathetic blindness

If you’re fundy and you like it then good for fucking you, but maybe it hasn’t been so kind to others."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"The main character is jewish and she doesn’t seem unsympathetic, obnoxious, or uneducated."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,People disagreeing with your faulty assessment isn't a hate rant. Stop.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,">Then how do you explain why you think the series is representative of an entire community and experiences all Hasidic women have? 

I never said any of this. You must have me confused with someone else."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"That doesn't equate ""reproductive slavery"". 

They're a strict religious community so there's lots to be critical of, especially if you dislike religious practices, but the darker more horrific story you describe isn't in the show. You projected your hate on to this community.

Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

Putting pressure on someone to consummate a marriage after a year, or to have a family with kids?.....It's obnoxious but it's not slavery. 

It's also fraud. The real girl went to Sarah Lawrence while observant, and became a writer. 

Hasidim exist in New York outside of their communities, and they work, drive, and have independence, and they can do that within their communities or out. The disadvantages of joining secular culture are not unique, and can't be equated to brutality. 

Nothing happened to this girl that girls haven't felt in the secular world either. Again, the sway the show depicts these people just validated hatred you already had."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"There's nothing sympathetic about a girl who shows up to a top music program and insults them like she can just audition for piano. 

Or invites herself places.

Or who doesn't know what ham looks like, and eats anything put in front of her then panics....or educated about someone who hasn't seen Google (the entire purpose of that scene).

It goes on and on. That character couldn't be more ridiculous."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"People outraged that some Jews don't cut their sideburns, and observe Passover by wrapping food in tinfoils isn't a hate rant.  Then you share their hate."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Then why defend the show? Why are you elsewhere in the thread challenging a self defined Orthodox Jew to tell you what was inaccurate about the show?
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"
>Because you really do think Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust. 

The fact you think any criticism of Hasidic Jews equates to what you stated above  is tiresome and unfortunately not at all shocking not shocking."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,God you sound like such an insufferable cunt.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,I'm Jewish jackass. Lmfao
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"The only other person I've discussed the topic with on reddit is not a ""self defined Orthodox Jew"", they said they're ""familiar with the Hasidic world"". All I did was tell him something to the effect of ""saying it's inaccurate is useless unless you give us examples of WHY you think it's inaccurate"". And I'll take this opportunity to say the same to you. What specifically is factually inaccurate?"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"What's tiresome is that you think this series depicts every Ultra Orthodox Jew, because what else did it show? Don't invent shit that's not in the show itself to justify your thirst. 

I don't think any criticism of Hasidim is a problem, there's a lot to criticize, it's unfortunately YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, as depicted with this one dysfunctional family.  You decided its representative... because you have a disdain for those Jews."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,You sound insecure on the internet.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Thank you.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Are you saying there aren't Jews who hate other Jews or Jews that are different than them, or more observant and it make it okay to express hate?  Take a hike."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"You don't even know what you're reading. They literally said ""I grew up ultra-Orthodox"".

I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced your antisemitic ass that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  The fact is the author the story is based on was able to get an education and stopped wearing her wig while still living in Brooklyn.  You're clueless."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"For someone who looks down your nose at others for allegedly making assumptions, you sure make a lot of your own.

>YOUR criticism and support of the show that's a problem an would require you to think all Ultra Orthodoxy Jews are uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust, 

When the fuck did I say that? That's not what I think. You have a chip on your shoulder."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Yikes, if you find yourself wondering why you can't maintain a healthy relationship, I have identified some factors"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"You can't even detail what you think you saw that was oppressive and represents the community as a whole, because you know it would paint you as bigoted.

Yet you're in this thread chastising anyone that doesn't think this is an accurate depiction at all. Take a hike. The reason you're passionate about this at all is because you have the chip you didn't even realize you had until now, and you got called out for it. Feels bad for you I'm sure."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"If you find yourself trying to psychoanalyze strangers on Reddit when they point out the shortcomings of your bigoted posts...you might just get a mirror and write ""sociopath"" and ""hateful"" on it."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"No, pretty much only you and probably not much longer. 

Hasidic Judaism is fundamentalist religion. Sexist roles, xenophobia, ""my-group-is-better-than-everyone-else"" mentality backed by the word of God, virtue signaling taking precedence over actual virtue (not cutting your hair = virtue signal. Covering kitchen surfaces in foil to prevent yeast from contaminating Passover seder = virtue signal), insular bubble...

I'm not saying every single Hasidic Jew is like this, but some/many are."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"You clearly know zero about Hasidim and couldn't site examples shown in the show.

You just rattled off a lot of assumptions that aren't in this series. 

And no, claiming you're an equal opportunist hater doesn't help.

I take it back saying you're a bigot was putting it nicely. You're worse."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Is [the official web site of a Hasidic sect](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/374918/jewish/Aluminum-Foil.htm) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? The same site also talks about [men not cutting the corners of their hair](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2963669/jewish/Why-Do-Some-Chassidic-Jews-Have-Long-Sidelocks-Peyot.htm). 

Is [Haaretz](https://www.haaretz.com/1.5212069) bigoted against Hasidic Jews? 

Virtue signals are negative things because they tend to serve as a substitute for virtue.

If I'm factually wrong, tell me what I'm missing rather than namecalling me."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"Holy crap, you're a Grade A bigot. You just used examples religious Jews observing their holiday by avoiding bread or hiding it under tin foil as an example of oppression and justifying your hate mongering. Those are harmless customs you are depicting as proof they're bad people.
Men choosing not to cut the corners of their hair is an example of oppression to you?  

You're an idiot, I'm not going to bother pretending you're coming to this from a reasonable place and neither should you. 

It's not ""virtue signaling"" you just used Passover against Jews."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"You're still just namecalling and getting angry at me for saying things you don't agree with, you're not giving me an example of what I'm saying that's incorrect you're kind of just angrily saying ""nuh-uh"". 

You're also not talking about the same thing I am, and you are putting words in my mouth.

**Religious groups, especially fundamentalist ones, have virtue signals. Displaying the virtue signals does not make anyone a bad person. I never said that because I don't believe that. I think virtue signals are problematic, that does not mean I think people who use them are bad.**

I'm not talking about hiding bread under foil or avoiding bread. I'm talking about [this](https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1745/jewish/Preparing-the-Kitchen.htm). It's not hurting anyone per se, but thinking God cares about such minutiae is genuinely sad to me and seems pretty unhealthy.

The whole point of the first Passover meal is that the Jews in Egypt had no time to prepare. They were in such a hurry they ate unleavened bread and drank unfermented wine.

This level of intricate, time-consuming preparation performed by many Hasidic Jews is quite the opposite of the original Passover described in the Torah. Passover was a hastily prepared meal in advance of an impending visit from an angel of death. The Jews in Egypt weren't covering kitchen surfaces and heavily scrubbing pots and ovens, they were throwing together a meal as quickly as humanly possible."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"That's a lot of minutia for clueless bigot. Now you're gatekeeping and saying one group of Jews in their diaspora don't practice correctly? You're a fricken Rabbi now? Get a life. It took me two seconds on google to see that preparing for Passover by removing, burning or temporarily hiding leavened bread is part of their custom. You hate some Jews, you're not smart, and you're actually critical of their religious observance as Jews, which makes you antisemitic."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,">I've already explained why it's inaccurate....remember when I tried to convinced [you] that ""not all Ultra Orthodox Jews are all uneducated baby thirsty cabals trying to repopulate the planet and avenge the Holocaust""?  

Remember how I never said that and don't believe that? The show never said that either. 

>clueless

>bigot. 

>Get a life. 

>not smart, 

>antisemitic

That's a strong argument you've got there. Have a good one. Sorry you're so angry."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"The problem is you're making bigoted lifeless, idiotic, clueless and antisemitic ""arguments"" and you're upset at the response you're getting.

Really...what kind of person gets upset that Jews hide their bread for a week in the privacy of their own homes and uses that as an example of xenophobia, or oppression?"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Episode 5 was pretty refreshing. It helped me want to finish the season. Glad to see Rickety Cricket in more roles.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I finished the first season the other day, I really enjoyed it, and as an Aussy loved seeing one on the show."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"It wasn't great, but I found it entertaining enough to finish the series.  Episode 5 was fantastic of course.  Cristin Milioti and Jake Johnson pull at the heartstrings.  Surprisingly, the show managed to gather an all-star cast.  It was neat to see Ashly Burch, sort of a game industry OG.  The comedy was more ""sitcom funny"" than actually funny.  There are lots of silly moments, like when the aging story writer (F. Murray Abraham) mistakens an air conditioner unit for the AI robot taking over his job.  It's on the Apple streaming platform so I don't expect the content to get too mature.  It is light-hearted and chill, which is nice."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"I thought Rob’s character not flat out being an asshole was refreshing/interesting and I enjoyed watching the show, but it’s not really that funny. Feel like that’s a problem for a comedy show."
You Cannot Hide,"Would have made an intriguing storyline if they let her *act* her way through the torment of an acne attack.

Fantasy reflects reality and the mirror is broken."
You Cannot Hide,"My mother watches this show religiously and this woman is her fave. I'm so glad I have some warning so I can hunker down and prepare for the shitstorm.

That said, when I get dragged into watching with her I rather like Maxie too. So I don't know if I'm going to be able to watch the same character with a different face. Not that I regularly do but... sometimes I have to endure the indignity to hang out with mom. "
You Cannot Hide,"I don't think it is just ""zits."" It wouldn't surprise me if it was a more mutual decision than the way some articles make it seem. She realizes she needs to take some time away from the camera (or, more accurately, the stresses of a tightly ran television production) and the producers agree (as her skin condition, the amount of time it takes to cover up, impacts the production schedule of the show).

On a weekly series, she likely would be able to soldier through until the end of the season's production then use the off-season to recenter her life a bit. General Hospital, being a daily program, has a much tighter schedule. It doesn't help that they likely run 1080p (or maybe even 4k) cameras now that capture flaws like crazy.

Also, the article mentions that the skin condition flairs up real bad with stress, and she recently has gone through a divorce. This time should be able to help her re-center her life in regards to that."
You Cannot Hide,r/nottheonion
You Cannot Hide,"God forbid we have someone with a skin condition on TV. 

/s "
You Cannot Hide,The headline doesn't match the article. The article makes it sound like she asked for leave time
You Cannot Hide,"Damn, so that's what happened to zenon "
You Cannot Hide,Sounds like Meth
You Cannot Hide,She should just wash her face and pillow cases. 
You Cannot Hide,"It's a soap opera. They're likely to have the acne be some horrendous skin eating disease that kills her. Then, once her acne clears up, they'll miraculously bring her back from the dead. They'll have had her lying in a coma in a cabin in Minnesota."
You Cannot Hide,"Do you watch the show? There is no chance in hell Maxi would leave the house if she had skin problems. She's the PA of a fashion magazine editor. Her character's boyfriend is the hunkiest guy on the show. She is one of the most shallow characters on the show, and easily the most shallow 'face' character (someone we're meant to root for).

It wouldn't really work for her. Using it for character growth would alter her character, and soaps rely on delicate balance of personalities to succeed -- note that this is one of the few major surviving daytime soaps, so they don't want to experiment."
You Cannot Hide,"Well, stuff cystic acne can get really severe and can cause permanent scaring. Skin conditions can also be caused/worsened by stress. Can you really blame her for wanting to take time off to get it under control?"
You Cannot Hide,"lol, what? I think she had a kid a year or two ago, and recently went through a divorce.

Sounds like the doctor was right and it's just stress."
You Cannot Hide,"Nice advice, the most basic and simple option. I'm *suuuuure* that neither she or anyone else around her has thought of that yet. You're so smart."
You Cannot Hide,"> They'll have had her lying in a coma in a cabin in Minnesota.

This is General Hospital. She'll be held as a medical experiment by a cloned Helena Cassidine. Robin will be kidnapped (for the eighth time in five years) to use Maxi's blood to create a cure for her beloved Mikkos, who she has held in a stasis chamber since his failed attempt to use a weather machine to take over the town (that part is not even hyperbole; it totally happened). Despite it being a bi-annual occurrence, none of her family will even start to suspect that she's been kidnapped until September. In the interim, her husband, Dr. Patrick Drake, believing that she has left him again (even though almost every previous time was to hide that she was been kidnapped), will begin a passionate affair with a new girl in town, who will claim to be Maxi post-facial surgery reconstruction. And faux-Maxi will get pregnant before the end of the storyline, because by that point in time both Theresa's baby and Lulu's baby will have grown to up to be teenagers, and the show just needs a baby for it's characters to fight over.

I have watched General Hospital since I was 16. I know how it would play out."
You Cannot Hide,"She will be offered to play the part of her original character's twin sister, but will refuse when they tell her she would have to audition for the part. Later, she'll be given the role of her original character with a brain transplant, after the producers decide to kill off another character due to a receding hairline."
You Cannot Hide,Horrendous skin disease are expected when the guy you've been banging for 5 years is actually your long lost half brother from your step mother's fourth marriage to a secretly bisexual matador. 
You Cannot Hide,"""I can't believe you've cloned me without my permission!!"" ~cue outrage from glistening face"
You Cannot Hide,"No I don't watch, thanks for the insightful comment anyway. "
You Cannot Hide,"I'd have had her hide in her house, conspiring with her boyfriend to get beauty and skin health supplies, sneaking in a doctor... all while her magazine job is in peril.  No personal growth at all, just a lot of lies and deception to hold on to what she has.

At the same time, you could cut her screen time drastically so the actress keeps working but can still recover from the stress issue."
You Cannot Hide,"Can't it also get worse by covering the hell out of it with makeup, especially the heavy makeup they give to people on tv?"
You Cannot Hide,Actually there's probably a fairly large chance that they have thought of it as it's a popular remedy. 
You Cannot Hide,Go on.
You Cannot Hide,AssGremlin must be jealous. All of his ass pimples got taken by this bitch!
You Cannot Hide,Yeah I was thinking of that as well - walking around with heavy makeup on your acne for 8 hours a day or whatever can't be good for your pores.
You Cannot Hide,That one sailed right past ya
You Cannot Hide,What? No one even mentioned a boat.
You Cannot Hide,"""I've been blinded by my mother's toxic love!"""
You Cannot Hide,I would recommend Legion and DEVS for the visual aesthetics and world building as well.
You Cannot Hide,Justin Theroux is hilarious in this.
You Cannot Hide,"Always happy to see Maniac get mentioned.

I don't have too many all-time favorite shows. Breaking Bad/BCS, Game of Thrones (at least in its prime), Mr Robot, Dark, The Leftovers, The OA, and maybe even Utopia (UK).

Maniac is also one of them. Something about it... dense quality packed in to almost every aspect. It's fun, it's got some depth, and it's visually stunning. For a miniseries, I think it's perfect (which is different from flawless, as I don't think any story can be flawless, especially considering that many flaws are subjective. For me, a story can be perfect as long as it hits enough notes higher than most stories do)."
You Cannot Hide,"I absolutely loved it as well, it's one of my favourite shows.  
   
But the storytelling is very unique and I can definitely understand how it is not for everyone. It has an almost Twin Peaks level of weirdness. Visually, it is pretty much flawless."
You Cannot Hide,I wanted to like this so much more than I did. And I liked it. I just didn’t love it. But it certainly had moments of brilliance.
You Cannot Hide,That show is really fucking good.
You Cannot Hide,I particularly appreciated the way they represented schizophrenia
You Cannot Hide,Annie I'm a hawk
You Cannot Hide,The lemur episode is one of my favorite pieces of tv ever!
You Cannot Hide,"I feel like this show disappeared from the collective conscience very quickly, maybe because it was too off the wall. But I'm glad you reminded us to que it up for a rewatch."
You Cannot Hide,It’s the best thing Netflix has produced.
You Cannot Hide,"I didn’t like it at all. So much time is spent on the meta plots they go through after taking the pills that it became tediously pointless. 

Like, when they’re doing a murder mystery party or when they’re in the 80’s trying to steal an iguana, etc, all of that felt so tediously irrelevant and pointless that it made me not enjoy the show. The characters aren’t aware of who they are in the real world, so it felt like the plot and characters weren’t progressing for long periods of time. 

Just didn’t work for me. Justin Theroux was the best part though and I loved the first episode."
You Cannot Hide,"Check out station eleven when it comes out on Thursday, same show runner."
You Cannot Hide,"It's been a while since I have watched this show but I agree,it's a really good minisseries with a beautiful message."
You Cannot Hide,It was pretty good.
You Cannot Hide,Maniac is awesome!
You Cannot Hide,I'm still using that wake up ringtone after all these years! Great series!
You Cannot Hide,I really need to get a poster of this show.
You Cannot Hide,Loved Maniac. This post might inspire me to do a rewatch. The music has stuck with me through all the years.
You Cannot Hide,I watched it and thought it'd have a good payoff in the end but it was just zany and off-putting. Wasn't my cup of tea.
You Cannot Hide,"Really well written and yes, the world building was beautiful. Emma Stone knocked it out of the park and Justin Theroux was hilarious.

I thought Jonah Hill struggled a bit with the acting scenes. He’s not a great actor and he has kind of a turkey neck in this (not his fault but it distracted me). 

Everyone else really out-acted him and I felt sorry for him. Especially when he puts on a fake accent, it was too cringey for me."
You Cannot Hide,Seemed like a ripoff of Legion
You Cannot Hide,My GF started watching it and likes it a lot. I will give it a go.
You Cannot Hide,"I watched it, but I barely remember anything about it"
You Cannot Hide,"What's wrong with the world isn't that I'm sick....

It's that I don't matter."
You Cannot Hide,"It was a really good show.  Jonah Hill surprised me, because he was mostly annoying in everything else he’d been in.


I wish we’d get more"
You Cannot Hide,"Exceptional show, really liked it. Justin Theroux kills it, i watch everything he stars in since his performance in The Leftovers. Criminally underrated actor."
You Cannot Hide,Cheers for the heads up - a comedys with Jonah Hill rated 7.7 that Ive never heard of?  FUCK yeh - thats higher than Superbad!!
You Cannot Hide,Devs is brilliant and on par with Maniac in quality even though they’re very different thematically. Great rec.
You Cannot Hide,I really loved the first season of legion. Need to go back and finish the series
You Cannot Hide,I thought Legion supposedly jumped the shark or something? I haven't watched it tho
You Cannot Hide,"While this is obviously subjective, if something is comparable to Legion, I'm instantly & completely turned off and most likely won't give it a chance. 

Legion is basically the definition of style over substance. What a waste of time that show was."
You Cannot Hide,"I know this sub can get kinda annoying with all the Patriot-praise, but based on the shows that you mentioned I feel like you would probably love it."
You Cannot Hide,a couple others I would add are Halt & Catch Fire + You're the Worst
You Cannot Hide,I don’t have the same list but it’s a good list
You Cannot Hide,"Patrician taste, i think Mr. Robot does not get enough praise, especially the last season was  absolute top-tier. Leftovers is one-in-a-million, too, next to Six Feet Under the most human show i've ever watched, extremly talented cast as well."
You Cannot Hide,"Excellent list, I would say a few strong 10/10 you got there."
You Cannot Hide,"Oh wow, I adore *BB/BCS*, good *GoT*, *Mr Robot*, *Utopia UK* & *The Leftovers*. 

Guess I need to give *The OA* and *Dark* (and *Maniac*) a shot!"
You Cannot Hide,"Another Neflix show which I think fits in this general genre of shows is Russian Doll.  It's a show you really, really have to let get going.  You think it's going to be a very specific type of season for the first three episodes, but then it really takes things in a new and pretty great direction."
You Cannot Hide,Found this while I was searching Maniac. We have very similar favorite shows. Definitely check out Severance ASAP if you haven't had a chance.
You Cannot Hide,5 6 7 8
You Cannot Hide,"I prefer Dark between the two of them, but love both."
You Cannot Hide,"> it felt like the plot and characters weren’t progressing for long periods of time.  

I get how you can say that about the plot, because plot plays a very minor part in the show. It's all about the characters and their growth.  
   
I don't understand how you can say that Maniac lacks progress in terms of the characters if you actually watched the show. It's the whole point of it."
You Cannot Hide,"I get what you're saying, but to me this show isn't good because of its plot, but everything else. The meta characters are elements of the psyches of the real world characters. Like for example the mafia plotline is about how Owen feels about his real life family."
You Cannot Hide,Take shrooms. Then you'll get it.
You Cannot Hide,"It's not the same kind of comedy as superbad, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless!"
You Cannot Hide,"It's far from the only example, but it's one of those shows that makes you think ""damn, Jonah Hill can really act."""
You Cannot Hide,Mizuno is so wooden and dull in Devs. Shame as I liked the rest of it.
You Cannot Hide,"I wouldn’t say it jumped the shark at all, there’s something that happens that not a lot of fans were fond of, but it’s still an incredible series. I’d also say it’s one of the best pieces of cinematography ever. I’d always recommend it to anyone interested."
You Cannot Hide,"Season 1 was pretty good, season 2 was a 2-pack of hot ass, and i can’t speak on season 3 as i never bothered to watch it on account of how awful season 2 was."
You Cannot Hide,"1st season was great, 3rd season was good, 2nd season was pretty bad imo."
You Cannot Hide,Legion was great!
You Cannot Hide,"Thanks a ton for the recommendation! I actually haven't caught much wind of Patriot yet, not enough to know if it'd be worth it for me to check it out. (I don't frequent this sub much these days, nor keep up with other TV news--I like to be as blind as possible when I go into a story, so I generally avoid such information hubs).

But, my best recommendations typically come from people who know the peak of my taste and give me content that hits similar lines. So, I'm looking forward to checking it out now!"
You Cannot Hide,"This is what I came here to say. I thought they might have the same creator (they don't), but Patriot is one of my all-time favorites. The vibe is very similar to Maniac."
You Cannot Hide,"I'm not sure You're the Worst really matches the tone of any of your favorites.  Having said that, it's a fantastic show.  If you read a synopsis of it, it will look like a horrible cliched cynical rom-com.  But pretty much every time you think ""of course, here's what happens next,"" it zigs a different direction in an immensely satisfying way.  Aya Cash (Stormfront from The Boys) is goddamned amazing in it."
You Cannot Hide,"Based on my favorites, or in general? If the former, I'll definitely add these to my watchlist!"
You Cannot Hide,"Always hear rave reviews of SFU, and still haven't checked it out yet! I need to get around to that one, thanks for the reminder!"
You Cannot Hide,"Good luck on our taste coinciding more!

I got the recommendation for The Leftovers from The OA fans. I asked them, ""I need something else remotely like this,"" and that was one of the top recs they gave me. It's at least as divisive as The Leftovers, so try to go in as open minded as you can. The first season started as an 8 for me then slowly hit a 9. It didn't become a 10 for me until S2, especially by the finale which sealed the deal in the best way possible. I will also say that many people disliked S1 but loved S2 (and some vice versa), so if you fall off board, but not completely, then keep going as far as you can.

For Dark, you may not need this advice, but to be safe I'll toss it out. 1) ensure you watch subbed. The dub isn't remotely as good, and it makes a huge difference. 2) don't watch in the background. It needs full attention. 3) try to go in blind--if you can get away without knowing a single thing, even trivial, all the better.

For Maniac, yeah, just buckle in and enjoy the ride. What it does, it does very well."
You Cannot Hide,"Oops, late reply! Russian Doll has been near the upper echelon of my watchlist since it came out! I don't know anything about it other than knowing that the vibe I get from people talking about it is a vibe that I think I would *greatly* dig.

Thanks for the reminder! It's about time to hike it up a bit higher in my watchlist."
You Cannot Hide,"I understood the ‘point’ of how the characters progress and how we learn about them through the fake scenarios, but because those weren’t actually the real them and their thoughts and more these fake identities they created who are just supposed to represent parts of their real world thoughts/feelings, it just felt slow and tedious imo. 

It’s a good show, just not for me."
You Cannot Hide,"Oh for sure - I like all sorts - Im just comparing to something else led by Jonah Hill!

In saying that,  mini series is always gonna rate higher than an equivalent movie, bit its still a decent rating, so Ive no doubt its gonna be great!"
You Cannot Hide,"Disagree, she was great."
You Cannot Hide,"She was so much better in Maniac. I was watching Devs and thought, who is this piece of cardboard they got to be the lead character? The boyfriend that died had more personality.

Also the ending to Devs was just terrible and the logic didn’t work, it was unsatisfying and ruined the rest of the show, which was great."
You Cannot Hide,"I didn’t hate season 2 but I though season 3 was better. Psychedelic and confusing as ever, but it ended the series well IMO."
You Cannot Hide,"You're welcome, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did :)"
You Cannot Hide,true haha. I was just listing a couple shows I want more people to watch. And I think you responded to the wrong guy!
You Cannot Hide,"hmm only Halt & Catch Fire fits your favourite shows. Did you Like Mad Men? Since you didnt list it I guess not

But H&CF is a character driven show, the plot is no doubt important but its more a vehicle used to slowly unravel these characters and their relationships. 

That's my view on the show anyway. You're the Worst is not one that fits your listed shows but if dark comedy and a deep dive into a dysfunctional, depressed-laden 21st century relationship sounds interesting than give it a shot"
You Cannot Hide,">I understood the ‘point’ of how the characters progress and how we learn about them through the fake scenarios, but because those weren’t actually the real them and their thoughts and more these fake identities they created to represent parts of their real world thoughts/feelings   
   
I'm sorry, but based on this sentence, you clearly did not understand.  
The scenarios were fake, they were basically drug-induced simulations. But the thoughts were still real. What happened in the scenarios absolutely affected the characters. A very obvious example would be >!Annie learning to forgive herself for her sisters death!<.   
   
I am not saying that you have to like it. And I truly understand if the show is not you thing or if you think it's boring. But this criticism is just not valid IMO."
You Cannot Hide,Agreed on every point.
You Cannot Hide,"S2 was 3 episodes longer than the other 2 seasons, and I think if they had just kept it at 8 (maybe 9, a lot of shit *was* happening) it would’ve been better. It’s not a huge dip in quality, but s3 was fucking amazing (the finale too, like you said) and s1 was also definitely better than 2."
You Cannot Hide,"Season 2 is where I stopped watching. It wasn't bad, but I personally thought that it didn't have the same charm as season 1, which I loved. I'm so glad to hear that season 3 was good."
You Cannot Hide,"Gotcha! Mad Men wasn't one of my all time favorites--that said, it was a solid 9 for me, for sure. Fantastic series.

I do also enjoy dark comedy, so I'll also have to put YtW on my radar! Thanks!"
October Faction,"V-Wars was bad. So bad.

""We murder everyone but demand to be treated as people!""

Yeah OK."
October Faction,"I would have been down for something like October Faction, until the description included ""tangle with family drama."""
October Faction,"Only seeing the trailer, I'm not sure how V-Wars ever got OK'd in the first place. Hoping to build off Vampire Diaries fanbase or something?"
October Faction,"October Faction might just be one of the worst TV shows I’ve *ever* seen. Badly written, hammy acting, on top of a boring, overdone premise with a load of clichéd characters."
October Faction,October Faction sucked so that isn't really a surprise.
October Faction,"Having watched both of these, all I can say is 'Good'."
October Faction,"watched October faction, regreted it"
October Faction,"V wars was okay, October Faction was pure garbage."
October Faction,Always a bummer when Shows get canceled and end on a cliffhanger. I thought October Faction was decent.
October Faction,"Think I only watched an episode or two of V-Wars. I expected way better since Ian was in it... holy fuck it was worse than what I could handle. Sorry Ian, your looks couldn’t save that terrible show"
October Faction,"Two incredibly crap shows that some of us invested time in and nearly died of boredom.

Watching them one after the other was like watching Twilight in slow motion except Bella had joined the Furry club instead of the Necrophilia one."
October Faction,I tried watching October Faction.  Couldn't make it past episode one.
October Faction,[deleted]
October Faction,Makes sense. They were both terrible
October Faction,"I was worried it was going to be cancelled, but I enjoyed V-Wars :("
October Faction,"Not surprised. Both trailers looked bad.

I think ""Medical Police"" & ""Wu Assassins"" are on the way to be cancelled too."
October Faction,maybe not a bad idea considering I've never even heard of them.
October Faction,"So sad to see October Faction suffer so much from review bombing, its a major issue with any show that even tries to broach racism or sexism."
October Faction,"Oh dear. I haven't watched either series, but Netflix used to famously give nearly everything a second season, just as a one-last-chance kind of deal..."
October Faction,They really should have included Locke & Key on this list. All three of them were garbage.
October Faction,"October faction was too woke, really didn't serve any favors."
October Faction,[deleted]
October Faction,"It's honestly a problem with most shows that try to use demons, vampires, werewolves or zombies as stand-ins for minorities.

Last I checked, Jews don't typically eat people's brains."
October Faction,"Yeah I got through a couple episodes, then just didn’t feel motivated to go back to it"
October Faction,">  ""tangle with family drama.""

That's what did it for me. I've watched enough CW shows in my past. I'm good."
October Faction,"The family drama wasn't even the problem, the problem is the horrific writing. When i tell you it was bad, it was really fucking bad. It felt like a badly written wattpad story. Locke and key was good though, you should check that out"
October Faction,Honestly feels like they were trying to trick people into thinking it's a Vampire Diaries spin off with that title.
October Faction,Watched the pilot out of boredom then proceeded to hate.-watch the whole season. I have many regrets
October Faction,"How could you not watch some kind of war between virgins, I'm assuming, knowing nothing about the show?"
October Faction,Yes especially since Ian Somerhalder is in both
October Faction,"> I'm not sure how V-Wars ever got OK'd in the first place.

\*answers phone* [Netflix, you're greenlit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuPfCuga5NE)"
October Faction,[deleted]
October Faction,The dad was some of the worst acting I've seen
October Faction,It wasnt that bad tbh at least if you compare it to stuff like I-Land
October Faction,Try Zoo. Stick with it and thank me later.
October Faction,Z nation is great
October Faction,"Wu Assassins was fun and had the good sense to end the season completing the story it told while leaving the door open for more stuff. Of course, I'll watch just about anything with Iko Uwais (how I ended up watching edited by a cokehead Mile 22)"
October Faction,"That was years ago, before they put out a new supernatural teen drama every week."
October Faction,"Locke and key was really good imo, a thousand times better than October faction for sure"
October Faction,"At least you are being honest about what made you dislike the show. Really pathetic to see so many people review bombing it because its at all progressive, and hide behind the thinnest veil of plausible deniability."
October Faction,"How does that logic track?

""Only people who haven't seen or heard about it may complain that it's gone"""
October Faction,"Hahahahaha i think the chick from iZombie was jewish.

But V-Wars was 'extremely low budget canadian crap'.

They couldn't even make the vampires sexy, which is my one requirement for vampire tv shows/movies, having their face look like it got squeezed when they go to murder people. So I stopped watching it."
October Faction,Also the problem with the Marvel comics trying to use the X-men as an oppressed minority (While people with identical powers get along in society just fine.)
October Faction,"It's like how in True Blood, we're supposed to feel bad for the vampires when they're gruesomely killing people every week."
October Faction,"The first 3 realistically becoming the elites over humans as humans become their employees and servants in a realistic scenario that is more in line with how power abd privilege truly works in real life.



The oppressed mages trope( the trope this show falls into but replacing mages with vampires) is one of the most harmful tropes in fantasy...more so than the chosen one and damsel in distress tropes.


This would be society in a setting of vamps, wolves, zombies, mages and humans


mages and vampires--->werewolf enforcers--->human middle class--->zombie underclass


the humans would view zombies as rivals for resources and the cause of all their misfortune(scapegoating) and discouraging solidarity between humans and zombies who vastly outnumber the vampires, werewolves and mages that oppress both classes."
October Faction,That’s the title of the books it’s based on.
October Faction,I could not finish the pilot. I thought about it cause I was laughing hysterically at how dumb it had gotten and then told myself to stop it as there are actually good things to watch and I wasn't going to watch anymore anyways.
October Faction,"I walked in on my dad watching that, the virtual prison shit? Yeah I immediately walked out."
October Faction,another life was pretty terrible too
October Faction,I-Land was awesome.  It was a masterclass in dumb shit we haven't seen since Zoo and I'm desperate for a second season.
October Faction,I've seen only the first 5 minutes of October Faction but it has the potential.
October Faction,I tried watching the I-Land when it first was released. I got like 4-5 episodes in and just couldn’t. I immediately forgot about the whole show until right now.
October Faction,"I had to stop watching because every kid on that show deserved a swift ring hand to the back of the head.

I couldn't make it through the house party episode because it was so kid focused.  That was the last 1/4 on an episode I bothered to watch."
October Faction,Ho boy - sometimes I'm left wondering where all of 2019 went!
October Faction,"Confession time: I made it all the way through October Faction. It had an interesting premise and I was rooting for it to get better, but it never did. (And the main character was either horribly miscast or just couldn't be bothered to do any acting.)"
October Faction,"Locke and Key had the same problem as October Faction, main characters just doing stupid things to advance the plot. It was miles away from the quality of the comics."
October Faction,"Because thata all you needed to see to tell it was trash, I would say."
October Faction,IZombie was at least good. It was done on the lighter side. Had an interesting premise with the main character. The second to last season is where it started to downfall which seemed inevitable
October Faction,"Speaking of, I take issue when they start saying stuff like ""Call me Mystique. Raven was my slave name"". Like, fuck you.

That's just wrong on so many levels.

And the whole allegory falls short when most of the main X-Men are all a bunch of pretty white people in an upper class Manchester neighborhood."
October Faction,The government in the comics was purposely oppressing Mutants because they were born with powers. That's why society feared them.
October Faction,"because metahumans are humans who obtained powers through unusual means (like gamma radiation) and are few in numbers. Mutants are far more numerous and represent the next evolutionary step, a replacement for the old. The mutants, in a sense, symbolize an existential threat to those that see them as existing along side humanity separately rather than being the next link on the chain."
October Faction,Guess you missed the concept of “true blood”. Or never watched an episode.
October Faction,I need to steal your idea!
October Faction,">The first 3 realistically becoming the elites over humans as humans become their employees and servants in a realistic scenario that is more in line with how power and privilege truly works in real life.

AlternateHistoryHub did a good youtube video about what would actually happen if mutants from the x men actually existed, and it's exactly like you said, the more powerful minority rules over the less powerful majority:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11jZsbuVQx4"
October Faction,"I would keep complaining about how stupid it was to my husband anytime he passed by the living room. All he could say was ""then stop watching it"" and all I could say was ""well, now I have to see where this dumb shit goes."" Plus I really have enjoyed Khandyse McClure since her days as Dualla on BSG. Should have just stopped when she died (really should have stopped once that stupid quarantine montage started)."
October Faction,"Well, there are (arguably) worse things you could have walked in on your dad doing."
October Faction,[deleted]
October Faction,"At least that was an original scifi non-prequel story. It was a trainwreck, but I'm overall still interested in the worldbuilding and where it goes next."
October Faction,"Was that that show with Katie Sackhoff and  Selma Blair?

Also, am I the only one who thought Maniac was a complete waste of time? Like, there's a reason nobody is talking about that show now that it's over."
October Faction,"Yay someone else like me! I liked how cheesey it was. Yes it is a terrible show but weirdly good terrible, in my opinion."
October Faction,It had potential but their writers are 13 year old girls and they fucking ruined it
October Faction,And yet....
October Faction,"I just finished October Faction, definitely the bones of a good story there. But the teen drama aspect was all over the place. ""Ok I just came out to my parents, but we can't be together right now?!"" Then the brother is storming off and getting upset, then he's in love again, then mad...it was just a mess."
October Faction,"Plus, unsurprisingly, was based on a comic book series printed under one of DC Comics' banners."
October Faction,Have you tried NOT being a mutant?
October Faction,"...Is that what makes the allegory fall short or is that what makes it more relatable to the white people whose minds they wanted to open? 

I mean, if you’re marketing a racial allegory and trying to change people’s minds, especially in that time, you have to make it “relatable” meaning that making majority of them upper class white people with superpowers would make it easier for those young white kids to make that connection. 

If it’s just a bunch of minorities complaining about how they’re being treated differently those kids are going to be turned off because “that’s what they do in real life anyway”

At least that’s my two cents, Unasked for I know. I do agree though about the Raven/Mystique thing. Especially bc they never outright said if she was a slave of some sort or not..."
October Faction,"It worked better in the 60s and 70s, when you couldn't put black people in things for fear it wouldn't play in the South."
October Faction,Well that's what morlocks and Genoa / Krakoa were all about.
October Faction,"But how does John Q. Everyman know who's a mutant or who's just a metahuman? How does he know Bruce Banner was irradiated in a secret experiment and not born with his powers? Or Wolverine wasn't bitten by a radioactive wolverine?

The whole thing...list most concepts in Marvel comics...falls apart when you analyze it with a modicum of detail. 

It's such shitty worldbuilding."
October Faction,"I never watched True Blood. But I did like the bit from ""What We Do In the Shadows."" 

""They hate us because of the color of our skin."" ""Also because we brutally murder them."" ""OK, mostly the brutal murders."""
October Faction,"I did. In fact I watched several, smart ass."
October Faction,[deleted]
October Faction,Like watching *Another Life*?
October Faction,"Among the last few shows I watched are 'Unorthodox', 'Kingdom' S2 (what an improvement!) and 'Castlevania' S3. Really really strong stuff released even just in the last few weeks on Netflix.  
  
But yeah, from what I have checked out, the shows declared terrible in this thread are in fact pretty terrible. 'Locke & Key' S1 had disappointing writing too although that one at least seems to have potential still."
October Faction,"Yep, same here. At least it has an over-arching premise even if the show is pretty much CW levels of acting."
October Faction,"I wanted to like that show with Katee Sackoff.    (Another Life) I love a good cliffhanger, but that show was really just edited so that the resolution to be problem-of-the-week was resolved at the beginning of next episode and then a new story started.

I am sure that I would watch more if more were made.  ("
October Faction,"Maniac was one of those shows that people think is really good because of its retro futuristic setting (which, admittedly, was amazing). It's actually a really stupid storyline with even dumber writing. That ""I'm a bird"" shit that Jonah hill went on was my cue to stop watching."
October Faction,"It's really, really hard to produce a show that is so willfully stupid without being campy OR overwrought.  Shows like Zoo and I-Land manage to drive the plot forwards relentlessly by *completely ignoring* consistency or logic and replacing it with action and novel developments.  It's a hell of a balancing act and I respect that."
October Faction,I’m not surprised. LOL. That actual makes sense as it totally had that feel.
October Faction,That line was in X3. Fucking Brett Ratner...
October Faction,[deleted]
October Faction,"I like the fact that they at least acknowledge that normal-looking, conventionally attractive mutants like Colossus and Jean Grey tend to be a little more accepted than mutants with outwardly different appearances like Nightcrawler and Beast.

It's like how DC acknowledges that people are more accepting of the humanoid, Caucasian looking Superman than they are of Martian Manhunter, whose outright alien in appearance. I think its interesting when comics do that.

Also, have there ever been any mini series about the Morlocks."
October Faction,Then how did you miss the parts where the humans were also gruesomely killing people every week?
October Faction,Fisting a midget dressed like Hitler?
October Faction,"YOUR MOM




I know it’s low hanging fruit but goddamn it had to be said."
October Faction,That show was hilariously insufferable. I didn't make it to episode two.
October Faction,"Hm... I found it really entertaining, but it was a really weird story. I thought both the leads were great, and it was just weird enough to reel me in and keep me watching. 

The ending was a bit odd, and it had kind of a weird melancholy vibe, but overall I liked it..."
October Faction,It didn't really have a whole lot to do with the comic other than the basic concept of zombie girl can eat brains and get flashes of memories. The whole coroner/police procedural element was only in the tv show and they chopped out other supernatural elements like her best friends who were a ghost from the 1950's and a wereterrier.
October Faction,Now you know how all of those old fat poor racist white people see themselves.
October Faction,I'd say humans have a distinct disadvantage in that scenario. Though everyone in that show was awful to be honest.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Didn't finish it but it's interesting. More about prevention by predicting and testing stuff. Touched on funding and anti vax.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Started watching it last night, saw JK as Rasputin and lost it.

That Jackass has been included in a Mel Brooks associated production warms my heart for the boys.

Seeing Pontius party-boi with an orthodox cap on was hilarious."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,4 episodes in and so far the “Curb Your Judaism” bits are my favorite lmao
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Swole Mel Brooks is some real nightmare fuel
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I did not recognize him as Rasputin initially until they did the Jackrasp thing. Always good to see some of the old Jackass gang together.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"I enjoyed it, but definitely fell flat in a lot of places. Still happy it was made tho."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Do I need to watch part 1 to see part 2?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,This show is fucking terrible.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,How is this dumbfuck shit popular?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"I’ve only seen him in *Men in Black II* and *Reboot*, and from what I saw of him in the latter I’d say he’s a good actor — it’s a shame he hasn’t been in more things, acting-wise."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Even in the original the Jesus bit is classic, “Jesus” “yes”.   
    
Oh God Richard Kind is perfect"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"No, nothing that happened in the movie is in the tv show."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I mean you should watch it cause it is a comedy classic
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Ok grumpy pants go back to bed
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Rasputin?  He apparently had magical powers.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,because he’s not you
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Not everything can be Bronie hentai or crush videos, as much as you might like it to be."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Which dumbfuck shit?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Go read your newspaper, old man"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,[deleted]
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,It does look mostly tryhard but there's probably a few bangers.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"You should check out the ringer, skiptrace, grand theft parsons, actionpoint, and big trouble. I'm about to watch big trouble cause I just looked up Johnny Knoxville movies and that one sounds wild."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,It definitely is!!! I actually watched the original Sunday night to prepare for this one and I’m glad I did!!!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I mean there is the Hitler bit but really no real reason besides its funny.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"And , like always,cause it's good to be the king"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Piss boy!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I love big trouble! I remember it used to be on cable all the time and I randomly gave it a shot and talk about an underrated comedy gem
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,It’s one of those easy cozy movies
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"If you're going to put concentration camps in another country, you'd better be flawless on the ice."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I'm sure the hitler bit was brand new and yes the movie is pretty funny.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Count de money!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,This was probably my favorite line/delivery from anything I’ve seen recently.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,The beginning part with Hitler skating was footage from the original movie. The announcers and scoring were all new.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"I completely lost it during the finale, crying happy tears."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I really like the trend of shows lately focusing on healing and redemption rather that violence and revenge. Station Eleven showed us we can get over our shit and move forward together- so did Mare of Eastown.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Not sure if ""uplifting"" is the right word. There is still a ton of drama and tragedy packed in to it's 8 episodes."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Uplifting? That's a gross simplification. 

A story of how and why people tell stories? Absolutely."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"*Our kids have been kidnapped. Anyway, how’s hamlet this year? We are impatient.*"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"I admit it took me almost the whole show to get to like it, let alone understand it, but boy those last two episodes are really moving.

And to think I almost quit halfway."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Great show but I’d say it’s actually pretty depressing for almost the entire series leading up to the ending
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I am still thinking about the Hamlet scene at the finale. I was so engrossed by it. Absolutely phenomenal!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,It’s sad
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I watched a couple of explained videos on YouTube and they really put a lot of brilliant still in the series that you don't catch the first time
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Just kidnapping and brainwashing children, strapping bombs to them and blowing up people.  So uplifting."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I really dislike Mackenzie Davis but this ended up being a great series.  A few glaring plot holes but still a great watch.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"As I said elsewhere, the finale caught me off guard with “that” scene. Made me so emotional and I am so glad it went down that way."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,me too. it was incredible. not gunna post about it here because spoilers but that one moment in the finale my god i was sitting in a pool of my own tears on the couch. so grateful this show exists.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I really need to finish mare. Paused after fourth episode and then forgot to return.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,A little too much redemption in the case of one particular character.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"> I really like the trend of shows lately focusing on healing and redemption rather that violence and revenge.

Can you list some of the shows ?"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Where's that guy who was using children as suicide bombers, let's be friends with him?  Really, did he express regret or something?  Not really."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,One of the few times I've caught myself actively leaning forward hanging on every word and note.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,And no one bats an eye about it. That bugged me the rest of the show. These kids are used and everyone is fine with the villain doing it?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"this show is on the ""do not criticize in any way"" list for r/television"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,[deleted]
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Me too! I was like, oh god it's going to be like every other drama but then it was a *good* ending, a healing ending, and it was so cathartic and just...really enjoyable to watch."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,It's got a pretty cathartic ending
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"I guess you can say that, but the world literally ended when he was just a child. That would fuck anyone up. He could have done worse, he was going to do more and then didn't, so he showed he can change and rehabilitate- doesn't make what he did in the past OK but still, it ended things more hopeful than synical"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Mare of Easttown and Station 11 like I said, also Maid too recently. Spider-Man No Way Home had this aspect to it a little bit."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,It’s explained (kinda poorly) that he didn’t tell the kids to do that it was another kid that did. Doesn’t absolve him of everything but is it is both explained he never forced anyone to join him or told anyone to commit any violence.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"*Is this guy about to stab someone on stage?*    
*Shhh let him deal with his trauma*"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,book ending was more realistic. The prophet gets what he deserves.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Was it not >!The creepy snake-like dude who was using the kids as suicide bombers? It seemed like they hinted at that being the case!<
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"My favorite part is when she's like ""Hey, you have a bomb?  How about we take it off and have a talk?  Don't worry about all your friends and their bombs wherever they might be, and let's not warn anyone."""
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Or how >!he introduces himself to Kirsten with ""I'm going to start making all your friends disappear"" and then he just acts like a nice guy the next time they meet.!<"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,The prophet had nothing to do with the kids deciding to become suicide bombers.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I'm not even criticizing it.  I'm just saying it's not uplifting.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"If it's any consolation, they're not quite correct."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,and Bruce Willis was dead the whole time too...
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Lol don’t worry. It ultimately amounted to nothing.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Yea I didn’t catch this until reading Reddit after. I listened to an interview with the showrunner where he expressed, maybe “regret”, that they didn’t explain this point as well as they could have."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Still, he kidnaps kids and threatens to kill everyone in the troupe. But by all means, let’s change the plot of the book and turn him into some kind of hero and love interest for the main character. 🤮"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Nope >!No adults were using the kids as suicide bombers. Tyler was telling the truth. One of the older kids interpreted Tyler’s prophecies and ran with it. It’s the same girl who shows up at the airport with all the landlines. She thinks they’re beacons.!<
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Honestly I got lost along the way so maybe I'm wrong.  I still never understood why David Cross' character was the target
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Which one was that? Did I miss someone?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I think it was the little girl the Kristen talked to at the end.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I mean I liked the show just that part bugged me. They made him a mass murdered and then forgave him because his mom was mean?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Didn’t he say he would kill everyone she cares about in the start
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"oh no, I agree, but sorry anything but praise and you get the hose"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"it's also really bad, but it's wrongthink on /r/television. can't express different opinions"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Is that a spoiler for Die Hard?  I haven't seen it yet, damn you!"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Which is why >!she lets her run away with the book after reading it to her. So she can share the rest of the story with the others!<
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"That makes sense, cool. 

Also, you need to switch the last two punctuation points for the spoiler thing to work."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,The creepy assistant that was trying to get them to come to the museum. Brian.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I thought they forgave him because he could act.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Oops. Fixing.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Ohhh right right
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,OUTLAW COUNTRY!!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Arrested Development joke here Michael
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Started watching this show not expecting much. Every episode has been fantastic. Good story development. The characters are all unique and likable. The cast and crew should all be proud of what they’re making with Reboot.
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Take a good look, cause it's the last time you're gonna see 'em."
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"""YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!!!"""
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,[removed]
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"She's been topless in a lot of movies, I don't see why this is even notable?"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,She was great on the fx show married too
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Spring Break!!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,More or less wasted in the MCU as Ant Man’s ex wife for some reason. She was great for the big part. But I hope they can use her again as some cool alien or villain later on. She wants to do action!
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,I’m confused by this headline and article. I mean I’m sure there’s Dot and Enzo out there somewhere because .. ya know.. Rule 34 but was she the voice of Dot or something?
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,"Glasses on, hair up or glasses off, hair down?"
Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak,Good ole Charlene … I mean Chrystal!
The Ghost Bride,Isn’t Us & Them a Netflix original? Flavors of Youth? I’ve seen Chinese products before on if.
The Ghost Bride,I thought ghosts were a big no no in China?
The Ghost Bride,Expect homophobia and zero LGBT representation.
The Ghost Bride,The Ghost Bride seems to have gotten some of its costume design wrong other then that it is good.
The Ghost Bride,Expect me to prolly not watch..
The Ghost Bride,[removed]
The Ghost Bride,Accidentally in Love is also Chinese
The Ghost Bride,"Prob targeting immigrant Chinese in america. Singapore, Malay, etc. Or Taiwan"
The Ghost Bride,"Nowhere Man has a major LGBT character, one of the better written characters in the show too."
The Ghost Bride,"Since there is rap music I was wondering if that was a concious choice!  Definitely felt different than mainland ""historical"" dramas"
The Ghost Bride,"Almost a sentence, A for effort"
The Ghost Bride,"I loved lockwood and co., the acting was incredibly confident and the whole premise of young people running ghost hunting agencies and hunting ghosts etc. was easy to buy into because of the quality of the acting, the score and sound design was also excellent and enhanced the mystery and horror elements - I loved the way Lucy's listening talent was presented - and the characters were memorable and easy to fall in love with. 

It wasn't perfect of course, there were a few 'why didn't they do that' moments and the show followed a few obvious tropes at times, but nothing that ruined the immersion or the fun, overall I thought it was great and better then I expected. I felt very anxious for more as the last episode closed too, especially with the tantalising ending."
The Ghost Bride,"I just finished Lockwood & Co and really enjoyed it. The acting was good, there was good characterization, and an interesting world.  I hope it gets another season. Netflix has been struggling to renew YA series recently (Winx, The Imperfects, Half-Bad) but Lockwood & Co is better made than all of those so I hope they give it a chance."
The Ghost Bride,"As a longtime, hardcore Ghostbusters fan, I loved “Lockwood and Co.” It may be a tad bit more on the fantasy side than the sci-fi side, but it was a refreshing take on the “ghostbusting business.”"
The Ghost Bride,Stephen!
The Ghost Bride,I am really enjoying Lockwood & Co.
The Ghost Bride,Still pretty salty Netflix cancelled The Bastard Son & The Devil Himself. One of the many many reasons why I unsubscribed from Netflix.
The Ghost Bride,"Lockwood & Co was so mediocre. The world had potential but they barely even show it and the main story wasn’t captivating. It was just another show with a cool concept that wasn’t well executed, in my opinion."
The Ghost Bride,"If this show gets another season while the bastard son didn't, I'm buying into the theory that netflix is homophobic.

Also I'm excited for attack the block 2"
The Ghost Bride,Attack the block was a really terrible movie imo.
The Ghost Bride,Yaknow im kinda surprised netflix has yet to go into the pool of Conan H.P and Tesla.
The Ghost Bride,Wonder if he's now officially uninvolved with that Snow Crash show HBO Max nixed awhile back. I remembered the author saying they were shopping it around but i'm guessing its gone dormant.
The Ghost Bride,"In my headcannon, Lockwood & Co takes place a couple of decades after [Odd Squad](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6319236/)."
The Ghost Bride,"Great show, but fuck then for the cliffhanger"
The Ghost Bride,Half Bad was great really bummed it didn’t get renewed
The Ghost Bride,"I think it's the best I've seen so far of the 'teenagers take on the supernatural' schtick, though I did also like *Shadow & Bone*."
The Ghost Bride,I was very surprised about the world it felt pretty different from almost anything else out there.
The Ghost Bride,I enjoyed half bad a lot more than lockwood and would say the leads had much better chemistry in half bad
The Ghost Bride,Just coming
The Ghost Bride,What about Heartstopper? Also am I crazy or is the main character in lockwood and Co. not gay too?
The Ghost Bride,"Yeah! For me, the first 2-3 episodes of Half-Bad were pretty rough but once the three leads were all together on their adventure/quest they had great chemistry that leveled up the show for me. I wanted a season 2."
The Ghost Bride,Ehhh Half Bad was okay until it walked into some light grooming. Then I just found it kinda gross to watch.
The Ghost Bride,"I really liked it too but the first episode made it seem like another YA supernatural trash show set in a high school. It also had some of the most questionable music choices I've ever heard in a show (not just in the first episode). 

I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people dropped it because the first episode was dumb school/party stuff."
The Ghost Bride,What are other examples of recent “teenaged vs supernatural” shows?
The Ghost Bride,I'm horrible for talking shit lol because I haven't actually watched the show.
The Ghost Bride,"Fate: The Winx Saga, The Bastard Son and the Devil Himself, Shadow & Bone, Stranger Things, Teen Wolf, Vampire Diaries, The Midnight Society, Sabrina, last season of Riverdale, and there are more. Now, in most of those the teenagers are also part of the supernatural, but the show's premise is still them versus the supernatural."
The Ghost Bride,">Episodes dropping on Disney+... the very next day after airing on Disney Channel

Owl House fans: **Are you** ***FUCKING*** **kidding?!**"
The Ghost Bride,This show is hella cute. Glad Lara Jill Miller is still voice acting. Loved her as Juniper Lee.
The Ghost Bride,"Man, between this, Party Down and Yellowjackets, this has been a particularly good time for me to be watching television. I'm so excited. This was one of the surprisingly best things I saw in the last year."
The Ghost Bride,They're doing that for the final episode of The Owl House as well.
The Ghost Bride,"I love her as Lambie in Doc Mcstuffins, her voice acting is super charming"
The Ghost Bride,It wouldn't *be* the final episode if they were doing this from the start!
The Ghost Bride,"It's always been the same amount of horny. Which is, a tame amount. 

I think they're noticing certain characters being *unexpectedly* horny, because comedy."
The Ghost Bride,I blame Hetty and her stupidly attractive accent. Lmao.
The Ghost Bride,We were on a respite!
The Ghost Bride,"i really, REALLY want jay & sam to make some pottery while alberta sings unchained melody"
The Ghost Bride,Is it because of the actor that plays Jay? Because I find him so unbelievably sexy
The Ghost Bride,I think it happened the first time somebody got sucked off
The Ghost Bride,"I mean you basically have to use romance storylines, the show is an exercise in having one hand tied behind its back in terms of plots, when most of the characters can't touch anything or leave the house."
The Ghost Bride,How can anyone not be horny around Rose McGiver?
The Ghost Bride,I’ve never noticed it.
The Ghost Bride,"I've watched both. The UK version is great. I'm a fan of British humor and it's just a really good show. But I also enjoy the US version. The first episode I didn't love because they really tried to copy the UK version almost verbatim. But it does get much better and I think it's established itself as its own show. Same premise, similar characters, but two entirely different shows that can both be enjoyed without hating one or the other. Now a show that we tried to do over here that was a shit show compared to the masterpiece that was the UK version was The Inbetweeners. The UK version is perfection. Idk what that thing was they made over here and called it by the same name but I mean just the worst piece of shit that's ever been broadcast. We owe the UK an apology and probably some type of reparations for the butcher job we did on that."
The Ghost Bride,Oh god did they butcher it this much? The original is brilliant but I couldn't even finish the first episode of this bastardisation. The acting was so bad and the changes felt unnecessary but mainly because the premise doesn't work well outside of an old country with heritage to play on that's over 200 years.
The Ghost Bride,"Hurr durr redditors love saxy wammin, show me bob"
The Ghost Bride,"It was weird to see her on ""For All Mankind"" in the first season without it."
The Ghost Bride,"He is one of those stealth hotties. Sneaks right up on you.

Not quite on the level of Chidi on the good place but still up there."
The Ghost Bride,"IIRC,  moments after drawing in her last breath in her bed in the mansion and dying alone, an elderly woman saw the ghosts appearing and greeting her.  Then she was ""sucked up"" in the air presumably going to heaven."
The Ghost Bride,"The first episode is admittedly not very good, but it gets better from there"
The Ghost Bride,How can you possibly tell if a show is bad if you didn't even finish the first episode?
The Ghost Bride,"It gets better. The first episode isn’t as good because they try replicating the UK version too much. It soon distances itself and dare I say it, the US version is less corny and has better storylines."
The Ghost Bride,The American version is so much better that the original.
The Ghost Bride,"Ah, Chidi."
The Ghost Bride,"Yeah, that is a very common problem for remakes. The whole 1st season of  American the  Office was pretty bad compared to the much better show it became.

Even much lesser shows like Call Me Kat tend to get better after they find their own footing. At this point it is just a meh sitcom instead of just bad."
The Ghost Bride,Unless they replace the cast I doubt that. The acting was obnoxious and the premise is weak without the heritage of an older country.
The Ghost Bride,"Plenty of shows start so bad you don't want to finish them. When it is a remake and the acting is bad, the lighting is obnoxious, and the jokes are tasteless misunderstandings of what the original used; it is easy to know it is a bad show.


You don't need to watch a whole Seagal film to know it is bad and Ghosts US version is like if Seagal tried to remake John Wick."
The Ghost Bride,"For it to be less corny if would need a massive 180 as the first episode is absolutely ridiculous compared to the original but largely due to the low tier acting and rushed feeling everything has can't help it feel like a less witty version that aims cheap.


The US Office had the same problem of not trying enough to be its own thing so at first just being the worst of both. So I can believe it having a better chance with a little more individuality but I would still want that gloomy vibe rather than overly polished studio look even if it was trying to do its own stories and twists etc."
The Ghost Bride,"This isn't the Office so that statement isn't accurate. The original Ghosts manages to subtly hit you in between the over the top stuff, the actors are a better calibre and deliver performances that don't insult the viewer.


Maybe a Ghosts inspired show in the US could work but this is a lazy remake that fails to capture the Britishness which helps Ghosts like it does with other failed US remakes."
The Ghost Bride,"I really hope you are trolling...

The British version is 100 times better."
The Ghost Bride,"You don’t know. You just assume. It’s the literal opposite of an informed opinion. That’s fine, you can keep it, but you can also keep it to yourself. Sharing uninformed opinions help no one."
The Ghost Bride,I watched half of the first episode of the US Office so I can unequivocally say the British version is better.
The Ghost Bride,"They improved the husband role, and it makes the show show so much better"
The Ghost Bride,"Nope, I laugh at every episode of the US version. It is the best sitcoms currently on the air"
The Ghost Bride,"If they want to advertise that they are willfully ignorant and quick to judge let them.

They can observe how quick other people are to judge them from 1 or 2 quick interactions."
The Ghost Bride,"I'm entirely up to date including specials for the original Ghosts because I enjoy it so much. The US version is so bad that the first episode made me turn it off. It is fine if you like the show but that doesn't invalidate my opinion of the show being nothing like the original.


It is the informed opinion of someone who liked the original saying that they're two very different shows. Unless you're about to say the rest of the show takes a complete 180 turn and recasts the writers and 90% of the actors then I don't need to see more to know it is not a remake for people who liked the original."
The Ghost Bride,"I personally don't like either Office shows, just know everyone insists the US one is somehow good."
The Ghost Bride,"The husband role isn't problematic in the original. He's a side character and it is OK for a male actor to be a supporting character to an actress main character. The husband works well not being overly focused on, the original shows him having depth and growth with a competent actor who plays the scene well without having as much screen time as the main cast."
The Ghost Bride,Sure but they turned the gay guy into a string of bad quality innuendo.
The Ghost Bride,"You haven’t seen a single episode of the US version in its entirety. You’ve seen every second of the original, by your own admittance. You’re comparing information you know to information you don’t know, making an assumption on the whole of what you don’t know from a small fraction, and are asserting a conclusion based on information you do not know. That’s why the opinion is uninformed.

Little Timmy eats pepperoni pizza. He’s never had any other topping on pizza. But, he ate pepperoni pizza from ten different pizza places all in town and loved it every time. The more he eats it, the more he loves it.

Then one day, he decided to try hawaiian pizza. He’s already expecting it to be worse, but is willing to try it anyways, just to see. He picks up a slice, turns it around, and bites into the crust, avoiding any toppings. He then tosses it down in disgust, saying the part of crust he ate was overcooked, and refuses to try the rest. He never tries the toppings or finishes the slice of pizza, let alone the entire pizza. He never tries it again at a different store, like he did with the pepperoni. Yet, he now insists that hawaiian is a terrible, inedible pizza and can’t imagine why anyone else would enjoy it.

That’s what you’re doing with Ghosts. You’re comparing something you consumed in large volume and already got used to with something you never legitimately tried, or gave a chance to breathe. Your opinion is not informed because you have not taken the time or spent any effort to develop an informed opinion. To do that, you’d have to watch the new show as much as you watched the original. If you were so put off by the glimpse you’ve seen that you don’t want to put the time in, that’s totally normal. It doesn’t change the fact that your opinion is uninformed.

That’s okay. Again. We assume things are a waste of our time all the time, in a society where media is abundant. But insisting that your uninformed opinion is more valid than other people’s informed opinions is egocentric nonsense that helps no one.

If you want to be constructive, talk about something you actually have knowledge about. Or, perhaps, ask questions on what you don’t know and keep an open mind. If you want to be antagonistic for no real reason, keep on telling people who watch and enjoy something that your negative assumptions about it are just as valid, even though you haven’t watched it."
The Ghost Bride,"Of course its ok for a male character to have a supporting role, its about having a character worth being on the show.

The original husband is forgettable and completely unused in the show."
The Ghost Bride,"He's gotten better over time, but he did start off much worse than the British version's. I agree that some of the British version's counterparts are better, but I also believe that some of the American version's counterparts are better now. Personally I now prefer a greater number of the American counterparts, but there are some great British counterparts that I wish had been in the American version."
The Ghost Bride,"If someone pissed in your mouth you wouldn't need to swallow everything to know it isn't orange juice. And this is a TV show, no politics or science or engineering; there's no need be all ""ask about what you don't know or talk about your knowledge"". My knowledge is I enjoy the original and the remake is repulsive to me as a fan.  The only thing I'm asserting over anyone else is pointing out how someone arguing against me has clearly missed something in the original to what they claimed and that they clearly wanted a different show, so it is lucky for them they got it in the remake because they were comparing Ghosts to Monty Python as if they're remotely the same content. 


It is very very very clear it is not the same show within the first episode. It is immediately clear through the colours and lighting that they're not planning to recreate the atmosphere and then they rush through the build up to try and get to the punchlines that the original actually tried to set up. The set and costumes are too clean, the lights too bright and it fails to set the stage of a run down old building with ghosts who died long ago in their period outfits. Then the actors start talking and their delivery is aggressively campy and Panto performance rather than just acting. While some attempts to make it a specific American version are clearly there, you also get clearly copied content (because it is a remake) but it just doesn't have that same vibe because it is jokes out of context.


Failing to capture the basic atmosphere could be improved after the first episode but that's unlikely. The actors changing their performances could tone down after the first episode but there's only so far it could go without replacing multiple people. Weak writing being clear in the first episode isn't a strong sell to hold on for a remake as they had a cheat sheet and still made this.



Sure, I'm no professional critic but I am able to notice differences and I am able to tell when a remake isn't made for fans of the original."
The Ghost Bride,Not everything needs to punch you in the face to have impact. The husband counterbalances the absurdity while managing to provide a classy amount of slapstick shenanigans. He grounds the situation against the absurdity of the ghosts while also providing an impulsive behaviour that in a normal comedy would make him the absurd character in the relationship.
The Ghost Bride,"Growing pains. Most shows don’t start at their peak. You’re listing your initial take to however much of the first episode that you watched, and are just assuming these aspects remain true for the entirety of the show’s runtime and also that you’ll never grow to appreciate any differences if you did take the time and make an effort. You don’t know the elements you describe remain constant throughout. You don’t know if the cast grow into their roles. You don’t know if the show gets _better_ as it deviates from the source material. These are all assumptions.

Piss doesn’t change flavors while you drink it. Different authors aren’t responsible for each droplet of piss. Piss doesn’t get a bigger budget as it goes on. You’re comparing something that isn’t likely to change to something that usually does."
The Ghost Bride,"Yeah, absurd is funny."
The Ghost Bride,"Well I've raised the issue of changing actors repeatedly here, even raised issues with the set and lighting, and no one has insisted it changed. Pictures in the article appear to show little difference. So I guess now is someone's last opportunity to finally step in and say ""yes they replaced actors, replaced costumes, replaced set"".


Are you speaking from experience about piss not changing flavour mid sip? As I'm being told I need to drink the whole show to be allowed an opinion so I just need to know if this standard is being met."
The Ghost Bride,"And too much cheapens it. The idea is balance, the show is supposed to mix layers into it and that's what the Americans always fail to understand."
The Ghost Bride,Explain Monty Python then
The Ghost Bride,"Ghosts isn't supposed to be Monty Python so it isn't supposed to get that ridiculous. Ghosts doesn't even try to go as ridiculous as comedy like Plebs for a reason, it is supposed to have a more drama like vibe.


Trying to compare the two shows you don't understand what the original is so of course you wanted something different."
The Ghost Bride,"The British Ghosts isn't supposed to be that ridiculous.

But you watched one whole episode of the US version, so why you don't you tell me some more about something I dont understand"
The Ghost Bride,"Crazy how taking a concept and then redoing it as another concept stops it appealing to those who liked the original.


You've made it clear that you like less subtle humour and don't want nuance. Enjoy your American Ghosts, there's obviously a reason American remakes do the exact same thing with every British show they take. Not at all like there's a long list of failed remakes because it misses the point so doesn't always translate, with the Office being the exception."
The Ghost Bride,"I liked the original, I watched every episode.

I just like the US version much better"
The Ghost Bride,I'm not saying that you're not allowed to. As long as the original continues we're both getting the best of both worlds. But you can't pretend they're trying the same thing even if the idea is copied and multiple jokes are copied.
The Ghost Bride,The jokes about Annie were brutal lol.

The Ghost Bride,> Let's just all agree it's uh... still okay
The Ghost Bride,BD Wong could have reprised/parodied his role. Dude has killer comedic chops and co-starred with Bowen in Nora From Queens.
The Ghost Bride,"> TVLine has an exclusive first look at Tara Reid guest-starring on the hit CBS sitcom, which you can check out above. **Reid will play herself in the Feb. 9 episode** (8:30/7:30c) — and as you might recall, the American Pie alum was Trevor’s celebrity crush while he was still alive. (He does look a little starstruck in that photo, doesn’t he?)"
The Ghost Bride,What is up with this season’s weird ass release schedule? They take a 3 week break every 2 weeks.
The Ghost Bride,"I just know someone is gonna come here and say the British version is better, but the two shows feel different enough to be their own thing. The US version is definitely one of my comfort watches every week"
The Ghost Bride,Taradise was an underappreciated gem during E!’s golden age

Sons of the Caliphate,"That quirky old Jeff Bezos, known for his humility and deference and definitely not for restricting his employees from using the bathroom."
Sons of the Caliphate,Fuck this guy. And fuck me for being a hypocrite who keeps using Amazon prime.
Sons of the Caliphate,"Bezos:

>“Every showrunner’s dream – and I mean every showrunner – their dream is to get notes on scripts and early cuts from the founder and executive chairman. They loved that. I need to thank you both for listening whenever it helped but mostly I need to thank you for ignoring me at exactly the right times.”  

  
>“My grandfather’s the one who introduced me to Tolkien. I fell in love immediately, I was probably 13 or 14 years old. I fell in love with the adventure of course, with the detailed universe, with the feelings of hope and optimism, with the idea that everybody has a role to play. And I’m happy to report that that cycle continues today. My kids have become Tolkien fans as well. In fact one of my boys I think approaches the level of a Tolkien scholar he knows so much about this universe. And after Amazon got involved in this project, my son came up to me one day, he looked me in the eyes, very sincerely, and he said: ‘Dad, please don’t eff this up.’ And he was right. We know that this world is important to so many people, we know it’s a privilege to work inside this world and we know it’s a big responsibility.”"
Sons of the Caliphate,"*""The lady doth protest too much, methinks...""*

Does Amazon's whole marketing plan revolve around the notion they haven't f'd this up?  

I went from thinking that people need to just wait and see, but every single day I see another article about how Amazon claims they haven't twisted/customized/bastardized Tolkein's stories.

I've pulled a 180, and now I'm worried that they actually have f'd this up."
Sons of the Caliphate,I wonder if Jeff Bezos is involved in Marvelous Mrs. Maisel...
Sons of the Caliphate,Can't wait to see how they still effed it up
Sons of the Caliphate,"My expectations are in check so I don't get disappointed

Flashbacks to Halo tv show, good lord that shit was awful"
Sons of the Caliphate,"Why should Bezos, who is not on the entertainment business, be giving notes at all?"
Sons of the Caliphate,"I want to know how these show runners have basically never been credited with any work, apparently worked on the last Star Trek movie but are uncredited and are put in charge of one of the most expensive TV shows, it’s weird."

Sons of the Caliphate,Well they sure as hell Effed up Wheel of Time.
Sons of the Caliphate,Why would Bezos be giving notes for a Prime Video production? Does he do that for every project or was it just because it's LOTR?
Sons of the Caliphate,CEOS and executives need to understand that they need to stay the fuck out of the creative process.
Sons of the Caliphate,Too late
Sons of the Caliphate,"without reading the article i understand the following:

Bezos Junior said to papa ""please dont fuck this up"" and Jeff Bezos passed this info to the showrunners: ""don't fuck this up!""

Now Jeff Bezos thanks the showrunners for ignoring the ""don't fuck this up!"" advice?

fair is fair, but why would Jeff Bezos be happy about it?"
Sons of the Caliphate,After watching the explosive abortion that was Wheel of Time I have no hopes for this.
Sons of the Caliphate,"so, he didn’t confirm if they fucked up or not. That jolly prize plonker Bezos"
Sons of the Caliphate,He still eff'd it up.
Sons of the Caliphate,Who the fuck cares what Jeff bezos thinks?
Sons of the Caliphate,I feel like it's a giant wet fart about to happen.
Sons of the Caliphate,"One of the executive producers on the show is Gennifer Hutchinson, who is a former breaking bad/better call saul writer and producer."
Sons of the Caliphate,So he ignored his son then
Sons of the Caliphate, I have a bad feeling about this.
Sons of the Caliphate,"Who the fuck is he to give notes for a tv show?

I know this is just an advertisement disguised as an article, but still. Stupid."
Sons of the Caliphate,How much did Bezos pay variety to run a story to make him sound relatable
Sons of the Caliphate,"And yet somehow from the trailers and every public statement made by the cast and crew thus far, all signs point to them indeed “effing this up.”"
Sons of the Caliphate,Would love to have watched this. But was too busy asking the ol' boss for permission to go to the bathroom
Sons of the Caliphate,"Is that Lenny Henry in Rings Of Power? haha, now that is a casting curveball"
Sons of the Caliphate,so will this flop?
Sons of the Caliphate,"I get all the hate for Bezos, but this a rather wholesome anecdote, can we at least give him that much? Redditors are a bunch of bitter people."
Sons of the Caliphate,Based on the trailers I've seen I'd say his son is going to attempt to murder him in anger.

Sons of the Caliphate,Wouldn’t it be great if network execs stayed out of tv
Sons of the Caliphate,‘Please Don’t Eff This Up’ waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too late buddy.
Sons of the Caliphate,Why the does Jeff Bezos think he's qualifies to write notes on these things anyway?
Sons of the Caliphate,Knowing that Bezos is connected to the show in any way makes me not want to watch it
Sons of the Caliphate,Fuck this guy
Sons of the Caliphate,"Show’s going to be shite anyway ‘Yeah, all those rules inherent to the world as per the author…naaaaah, we’ll just ignore that’ can’t see that going wrong"
Sons of the Caliphate,"Turns out, they fucked it up."
Sons of the Caliphate,"I've seen the trailer and based purely on that I'm not going to watch it, lest it forever taint my fondness for Lord of the rings."
Sons of the Caliphate,"And then show runners go on to screw it up royally.   


The End."
Sons of the Caliphate,It’s gunna be sooo bad.
Sons of the Caliphate,"That dude is such a goon, good lord. I'd ignore him too."
Sons of the Caliphate,Please don’t elf this up 🧝🏼‍♂️😂
Sons of the Caliphate,But he did eff it up. Just by existing under the Amazon banner it will never be good.
Sons of the Caliphate,"Oh man, he doesn’t know yet?  Has he not seen the trailers or the interviews with Amazon’s Tolkien Experts?"
Sons of the Caliphate,Now I want them to fuck this up
Sons of the Caliphate,"Jeff, that’s a weird way to take credit."

Sons of the Caliphate,Sometimes a good storyline is worth more than a show to maximize profits
Sons of the Caliphate,his opinion shouldn’t have been considered to begin with
Sons of the Caliphate,"While you’re at it, please don’t eff up Wheel of Time."
Sons of the Caliphate,The marketing about this show on reddit is insane
Sons of the Caliphate,Can his son tell him to pay his fair share in taxes too?
Sons of the Caliphate,Sorry but why the hell would he be giving notes in the first place? He runs Amazon but that doesn't mean he should be sticking his nose in e everywhere
Sons of the Caliphate,Wish somebody had slipped Jeff’s son’s advice to the Wheel of Time folks.
Sons of the Caliphate,"They certainly messed up the Wheel of Time, but I’m cautiously optimistic."

Sons of the Caliphate,"Lol, Bezos was gonna act like a broadcaster and force stupid shit into the show?   Wow."
Sons of the Caliphate,"I have a feeling it’s going to be a show designed by committee. It’s has nothing to do with any Tolkien primary material, it seems unlikely that they won’t screw it up."
Sons of the Caliphate,"Can't wait for the part where they say ""now we've made the rings!"" and then use all their power on the bad guys"
Sons of the Caliphate,Can someone put me in touch with his son? I need to talk to him about Wheel of Time.
Sons of the Caliphate,"Good that at least creators and producers can call that RoP any good :)) Sometimes no one will say good words to you, except yourself lol 😂"

He was described as being more imposing than even the largest Nuemenorian... And they were just shy of 8'...  That doesn't sound anything like who they cast..

Also female dwarves have beards...

Also the hobbits shouldn't be involved... That was the whole reason a Hobbit was chosen to get the Arkenstone... Even a dragon wouldn't recognize their scent.  They kept to the shire largely protected and sheltered passively by Tom Bombadil and weren't involved in the rest of the world."

Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I know i'm not the target audience, and its for kids, but i hate this artstyle, it looks... idk, generic?

also what's with the design, why is everyone looks from the Michael Bay design from that 2014 movies? is this a spinoff or is that the new standard design?"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"It's telling that this show only made it to 39 episodes. The original ran for 193, the 2003 version 155 and the 2012 version 124."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Mystic powers? \*sigh\*
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Leo reminds me of Kyle Schwartz
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"No, seth rogan movie wont come out till 2023"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Rise of the Teenage Mutants is a show that started in 2018 and now it has a movie.

I don’t know what you mean by spin-off as don’t they always reinvent the characters every couple years?."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Generic? How many cartoons in the last decade can you name that look like this?
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Everyone is a specific kind of turtle, it's a cool take on them"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I really dislike the turtle design, that’s usually my beef with all these spin offs, they perfected the turtle look in the 90’s yet feel the need to keep changing it for every adaptation."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Very few cartoons that aren't sitcoms hit lengths like that these days.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The first movie had Splinter telepathically reaching out to Leo
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Not everything has to look and feel the same. I’d rather have the variety.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Ignore the haters, that's for the better."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,It looks like Teen Titans Go and all the other cal-art style Cartoon Network shows.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,None of those things look alike.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Not every show is going for the same thing. I wouldn’t watch She-Ra for the fluid action just like I wouldn’t watch Bob’s Burgers for it either.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"*""It looks like cartoons!!!""*"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I personally wanted to see sick anime fights in Bob’s Burgers, but if you can’t appreciate that then idk what to tell you my friend."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Not a huge fan of the designs here, but I imagine I'm not really the target audience anymore"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,So sais are too dangerous but swinging a katana blade is still okay for the kids.  Got it.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Ooh this just looks bad. I wish they go back to the original designs of the turtles with some minor tweaks because all this trying to make them look badass makes me take them even less seriously. (Not to say the originals weren't badass, if anything their design made them even more so)"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"As a very casual Turtles fan, gotta say, these look pretty bad. I think I like Mikey's look the most. The other's are just off. Why launch a new series? What was wrong with the more recent Turtle's show? "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Im gonna be dissapointed if Leonardo isn't just Jean Ralphio as a ninja turtle

But yeah... this looks bad"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Why does Raph have tonfa not sais?
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Serious question: What's with the entertainment industry (films, tv, comics) constantly turning redhead characters black?"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Here is an [imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/zVLP5) to the art if you don't want to deal with that horrible website.

Good god the art style/redesigns are ugly. I understand they want to put their own stamp on it but that's some [Extreme Looney Tunes](http://looneytunes.wikia.com/wiki/Loonatics_Unleashed?file=Loonatics_titulo.jpg) level of fuckery."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"That doesn't look like Raphy at all. Big, brutish and no sais. wtf?"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Well, everyone here already shared the obvious general impressions about these redesigns, so I'll go with the following.

I see Raph followed the footsteps of Sonic Boom Knuckles."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Oh....oh no......As a Turtles fan, these design choices are a load of sewer ass. I don't even care about black April, in fact I'm all for a bit of a change up for her character. I just hate the designs themselves and the obvious changes made to their character traits (like Raph now being the leader, and Leo the wisecracker...like wut)."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"What the everloving fuck is this?

"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I'm usually excited for turtle redesigns, its the best part about the new versions. But this looks so bad, like they didn't even try. Not to mention those weird ass smiles. What were they thinking with Splinter? "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,So confusing on the [art design and ugly.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CZqaWl9WIAAgaRi.jpg) Do I have to re-design instead of cutting corners. Splinter looks hideous. Get the people who made Avatar air bender to help fix the designs. I loved April's red/orange hair.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"This website wouldn't load for me, so I [found this article from Collider.](http://collider.com/rise-of-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-characters-artwork/)

The new turtles look weird as shit.  Raphael looks like a roided-up villain, Leonardo looks anorexic, Donatello looks pissed, and Michaelangelo looks like a woman.

And based on the descriptions, it looks as though they switched Leonardo and Raphael's personalities.  Now Leo is the ""cool but rude"" one, and Raph is the team leader.  

Eh, whatever.  They're just selling toys to a new generation of kids. Speaking of which, I want to see how weird the toys look."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"As my namesake I cannot accept Raph not having sais. Also again even though Raph is my favorite, Leo should absolutely be the leader, Raph works best as the rebel who becomes second in command when needed"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,It's a little odd that the turtles are all different species this time.  
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Where tf is Don?  

Oh he's the hoverboard, that makes sense."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,This is the most unironically 90s thing I've seen in years. That is not a compliment.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Yikes. I’ll have to get my Turtle fix from Injustice 2 I guess.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Though I'm not the biggest fan of these redesigns I do like the recent trend of making the four turtles look more distinct than ""different colors and weapons""."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I liked the 2012 TMNT 3D show but the change in this show is way  too much.  Looks like its targeting 5 years old with that art style. 
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Oh god it’s so freaking ulgy! I always say that a good cartoon can have bad animation as long as it has a great story to carry it. It’s never the otherway around. But freaking hell this is the exception to the rule!!! Damn kids have it bad
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,This looks stupid.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,The turtles are outcasts because they are talking turtles. That has nothing to do about race. This isn’t some drama series.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Why does April have to be black? What does that add or matter?
Why does Splinter look awful? He looks like some side character they met in one episode. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I grew up watching the old cartoon, the 2000’s series (My favorite), TMNT: Fast Forward, and some of the 3D Nick series. This is by far the worst animation/Character design I’ve seen for this series.

I’m fine with them taking chances with character design, but this just looks gross. Hopefully its made up for in story, characters and voices. 

I wonder what Shredder looks like. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,why the hell is april black?!
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I'd give the animation a chance like I did the 2012 series with the 2003 series being my favorite of the bunch but man, what they did here with the trade in positions and personalitys is just awful. Well, they just switched Leo's and Raph's for some reason and left Donnie and Mikey's the same, but Leo's always been the leader even back in the 80s cartoon which was as comical as it could it get since, why? I thought these guys worked on the 2012 series WTF?! Screw your guys for doing that. You screwed Leo and Raph fans over big time here, fans loved Raph for his rebellious attitude and sarcastic humor and fans loved Leo for his, well I just loved his character and skills in every version. I don't know if they thought it would be funny to screw with the fandom or something, why you do that why?!"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"OK....but...why does it matter that April is black? As far as redesigns go, that is far from being a worry of mine."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,What the hell happened to the ninja turtles?!? 
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I don't want to be that guy.... but... yeesh. A lot of bad decisions here. April being black is not one of them.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,i guess they're going the teen titans Go route 
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"In the original cartoon their roles were perfect, Leo was the leader and Ralph was his second in command. Leo was the only one who could keep Ralph in line and Ralph’s tendency to be defiant and question everything made sure Leo was always on his game as the team leader while keeping him grounded.
"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Guess they're doing what was done for 'Wolverine & the X-Men'. *Make the most popular one the leader!* - Executard. 

Wolverine goes from rebel hothead to leader while Cyclops becomes a brooding depressive. Good series tbh. Too bad they pulled the plug. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,">Leo’s not the leader
>Mikey doesn’t have nunchucks
>Raph doesn’t have sais 

Fuck this entire thing with a broken bottle. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Oh god. Donatello looks cool but everyone else’s weird teeth didn’t need to be showing 
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Yeah the designs are pretty radically different. I guess I don't mind them trying different things given so many previous adaptations though.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"That was one of my bigger takeaways from this. I don't mind change since I'm not part of the target audience, but some things shouldn't change for the sake of the people who grew up watching TMNT. Rafael just looks wrong without his sai's"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,There was so much wrong going on behind the scenes. Maybe they don't wanna do 3-d animation anymore.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"There was a live stream today and this was revealed about Leo:

> * Red-eared slider turtle
* He’s got a certain swagger to him
* Incredibly intelligent
* He boasts irreverent charm and a rebel heart
* He doesn’t have a burden of leadership so he’s more free, laid back
* Kind of a smart buddy, what he does is always quippy
* The kind of guy who’d say “Look I don’t mean to be condescending, oh I’m sorry, that means; talk down to you.”
* Very lean
* Uses a ōdachi sword
* Mikey and Leo have the special relationship, Mikey is the youngest brother and Leo takes him under his wing
* He’s the kind of guy who creates catchphrases"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Because sais look like stabby things even though they're more like parrying daggers used as bludgeons and people are stupid.

It's the same 'think of the children' logic behind calling the original cartoon series 'Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles' in the UK because Ninja suggests violence...

"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Man, I'm a redhead and they really do this constantly.  its a bit disappointing, there aren't many redhead guys in movies anyway."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,What other times has that happened? And Spider-Man Homecoming doesn't count because that's a new character and not Mary Jane. 
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,[deleted]
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Wasn't a fan of the turtles' designs, but Splinter's is just so bad he's not even that ratlike just hideous "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"At least those Looney Tunes design are simple, these turtles are so over designed it hurts."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,I actually liked that show as a kid for some reason
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"they all looked bad, but Splinter was the worst."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I kind of like that actually. If they're all from a pet store, and were bought by a little kid at random, it's appropriate enough. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"> Why does April have to be black? What does that add or matter?

Why does April have to be white? What does that add or matter?"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Wasn't Fast Forward a direct continuation of the 2000s series in the first place?
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Possibly because she looked black in the early black/white comics, and Kevin Eastman originally intended for April to be black."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"> April being black is not one of them.

Gotta get dat d i v e r s i t y cred, right?"
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Why do you say that?
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Changing Leo from being the leader is like taking away Raph’s rebellious nature, or making Mikey the bad boy or making Donny a dumb bro or something. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Ralph, my favorite turtle."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Is Raph really the most popular? I always figured it was Mikey. (My fav was Donatello)
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Yea that was a totally underrated series.  It was really great
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Have you ever watched the old TMNT though? They rarely ever actually use their weapons against bad guys if at all. I’m pretty sure the network wanted a light tone. 
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Third reason: 2D animation is cheaper than 3D.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Did they just make leo, cartoon Ralph..."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,">""He’s the kind of guy who creates catchphrases""

I cannot tell if this is supposed to be funny, cool, or very very sad. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"> * He doesn’t have a burden of leadership so he’s more free, laid back

 I do like this quote a lot. He always did seem very burdened "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,So he's basically Raph. WTF? This show is going to be terrible.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Which is weird, I have a pair awhile yes they are pointy they'd require so much force to use as a stabbing weapon your better off using a fork. ""Think of the children"" logic is so bizarre and is really scatter shot across Turtle media. "
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Examples?  Seriously didn’t know this was a thing
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,No she isn't.  She is white in the original comics.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Jimmy Olsen in Supergirl and Wally West in The Flash/New 52.
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"I mean, she is MJ, but whatever, semantics.

Another example is Barbara Gordon in Lego Batman I guess? That’s all I can think of."
Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Annie, Wally West, MJ does count, because it's obvious they only backtracked due to fans not liking it, Jimmy Olsen, Hawk Girl, "

Nailed It! Germany,"Norway doesn't have a tradition to watch this on New Years Eve, we watch it on December 23rd. Yes, we know it's a New Years sketch, but the tradition is still the 23rd which we call 'little Christmas Eve'."
Nailed It! Germany,Used to watch it in the Netherlands as well. Then one year they just stopped.
Nailed It! Germany,"The same procedure as last year, Miss Sophie?"
Nailed It! Germany,A German friend introduced me to this a few years ago she couldn’t believe we had never seen this in the UK or knew who Freddy Frinton was.
Nailed It! Germany,Just watched that at dinner. Kids went crazy by the tiger head jump. 😂
Nailed It! Germany,Not seen in Finland
Nailed It! Germany,Never shown in Britain except for once a few years ago when they decided to let people know what the foreigners were on about.
Nailed It! Germany,"It's also shown *exactly* at 9PM. One time they showed it *before* that, which resulted in angry phone calls and a rerun at 9PM.

(Neglelakk, hehe. Blir ikke mer innlysende norsk enn det.)"
Nailed It! Germany,"The same procedure as every year, James."
Nailed It! Germany,"Vi leker ikke tradisjoner altså, skal det være så skal det være >:("
Nailed It! Germany,"Vettuhva, bare [stapp dette inn i årene mine.](https://youtu.be/X6X2uEAbzJs)"
Nailed It! Germany,"Litt usikker hva Yellowjackets har med noe her, men introen er knall den, og det var serien og!"
Nailed It! Germany,"Really depends on the show, but I think people would be surprised at how little some crew members make. On some of the biggest reality shows, teams of producers are non-union and get no benefits.

Production companies like Magical Elves, Kinetic, World of Wonder, World Race productions that make Drag Race, The Amazing Race, Love is Blind all of have teams of producers who are non-union and it's reports like these where networks would rather shut down production than work with crews trying to unionize that continue to make it difficult."
Nailed It! Germany,WES?
Nailed It! Germany,[deleted]
Nailed It! Germany,"Bummed not to get more holiday episodes, which are my favourites, but obviously I support the staff and they deserve to be treated and paid fairly."
Nailed It! Germany,"And then people go and celebrate when actors successfully lobby to get paid 100k per episode, meanwhile the people who actually MAKE the show get like minimum wage while also putting up with unsafe shit depending on the show (like I'm sure animated shows don't have much of an issue with safety violations, but reality and action shows probably have a lot)"
Nailed It! Germany,Sounds like he couldn't take it any more.
Nailed It! Germany,It seems to be more than $$. There were apparently practices that were not necessarily safe.
Nailed It! Germany,"Na. It’s just a big message to the industry. We don’t care if we make money or not, you can’t exercise your rights, if you do so, we will invest elsewhere."
Nailed It! Germany,They probably don’t want to set a precedent.
Nailed It! Germany,Hah hah hah... they make a fortune.
Nailed It! Germany,"Last I heard, Nicole Byer, who hosts this and also Wipeout still has a damn roommate."
Nailed It! Germany,same
Nailed It! Germany,We won't get to see his golden locks anymore.
Nailed It! Germany,"You mean covid safe or something else? Baking show can't be that dangerous, well maybe for the contestants."
Nailed It! Germany,Aren't large portions of the industry extremely unionized? That's what the Screen Actors Guild and company ARE.
Nailed It! Germany,"Has she shared thoughts on this? Last I heard, which is couple years ago, they just inform her like few weeks before hand to come and host, like she was barely made aware if the show was cancelled or not. Seemed pretty shitty."
Nailed It! Germany,"I listen to one of her podcasts & the roommate moved out with his partner last year. 

Since then, Nicole has picked up some extra dollas from NBC for the first session of 'Grand Crew', plus she's co-hosting the critic's choice awards with Taye Diggs so she's doing a-ok."
Nailed It! Germany,She has said on her podcast she likes having a roommate.
Nailed It! Germany,I heard that there was an accident one time with the liquid nitrogen and a crew member that shouldn’t have been handling.
Nailed It! Germany,"Correct, but they don’t want new ones."
Nailed It! Germany,Not for Netflix productions.
Nailed It! Germany,HAWESSSSSSSSSSSS has had enough of this shit.
Nailed It! Germany,Honestly shocked a show with this viewership and this many seasons wasn’t union already. These “New Media” shows need to stop getting away with stuff like this
Nailed It! Germany,I stand with IATSE.
Nailed It! Germany,HWES needs to unionize
Nailed It! Germany,Can someone give us the highlights of why it matters either way?
Nailed It! Germany,I worked for Magical Elves as the interim IT administrator in 2009 for a few weeks so this hits really close to home.
Nailed It! Germany,It's not a great loss. It's such a cringe show it's hard to watch.
Nailed It! Germany,HWES!
Nailed It! Germany,"I don't even think it's a new media issue (though it is an issue), I worked on newer seasons of reality/doc shows in 2016-2018 and those weren't union."
Nailed It! Germany,IATSE is the union for grips and other off screen workers. Essentially they announced they are going to try and unionize
Nailed It! Germany,"Unionization provides the technical workers with pension and health care benefits and other guarantees to break time, and daily turn around time. Striking a show with the support of the union prevents any union member from working on that show and makes “scabbing” the show as non union worker a bad idea if you ever want to join the union. On the flip side it costs the production company more money. Much of the time these shows flip union without any fan fare."
Nailed It! Germany,"The workers unionize: The world literally becomes a better place.

The rich fucks win: The world's oligarchs have even more resources to rape children with."
Nailed It! Germany,This was such a cringe comment that was hard to read.
Nailed It! Germany,I’m tired of opening these crappy “secret” doors  on this crappy “secret” show!
Nailed It! Germany,“Fall” isn’t setting a Netflix premier for Great British Baking Show. We already knew “Fall” it’s always “Fall.”  I’m looking for a date. Or at least a specific month.
Nailed It! Germany,Next month for Nailed It! Hell yes
Nailed It! Germany,I wish Netflix would get The Great Canadian Baking Show (Dan Levy hosted first two seasons and was terrific) and the Great Kiwi Baking Show. I was briefly able to get them in nefarious manners but would watch again. With Dan Levy being so popular it’s surprising TGCBS isn’t available outside Canada.
Nailed It! Germany,I really dont like the new comedian guy on bakeoff :( Noel is amazing but the other guy is just too strange for me
Nailed It! Germany,[removed]
Nailed It! Germany,[deleted]
Nailed It! Germany,I live for the GGBO! I wish we could get the celebrity versions on Netflix too.
Nailed It! Germany,"I had a dream that Ted Lasso was a guest judge and they had to make his biscuits, Paul Hollywood giving him a handshake with the sample, Ted spitting tea into someone’s face"
Nailed It! Germany,Either way it's not soon enough. I need that wholesome baked goodness now
Nailed It! Germany,"Oh Wes. Wes. Wes!!!

Yippee I need my Wes🥰"
Nailed It! Germany,"I definitely prefer the first couple seasons where the challenges actually looked like things I thought I could do, even though I probably couldn't, but they at least LOOKED doable. Now it's just stuff you know NO ONE could even come close to."
Nailed It! Germany,"Yeah, Lucas is clearly struggling with the format. As much as I despise his work with Walliams he's funny but he's awkward as hell on Bake Off."
Nailed It! Germany,same :( I miss sandy
Nailed It! Germany,"Same energy as saying ""I PAY YOUR SALARY"" to public service workers. 

The $15 a month you pay isn't enough for them to close the millions of dollars they'd need to get the license back for this stuff.  I know Hunger Games used to be on there, I assume the viewership numbers were too low to justify them continuing to pay for the streaming rights. 

Just buy the DVDs."
Nailed It! Germany,"Seeing as how I also pay them, I say they do the opposite of what you say."
Nailed It! Germany,I can't tell if you're trolling or just incredibly young with terrible taste.
Nailed It! Germany,"The term exists, but in this case the show would then be called ""The Great British Face-Off."" Not exactly a fitting title for a friendly baking competition! And ""The Great British Baking Face-Off"" just doesn't roll off the tongue, so we settle with Baking Show. 

It's because Pillsbury, an American baking company, holds its own baking competitions and owns the trademark for the term ""Bake Off."""
Nailed It! Germany,Crime Scene Kitchen isn’t quite as wholesome but it’s a pretty fun twist on that Baking show format.  Plus Joel McHale is far less creepy than Matt Lucas.
Nailed It! Germany,"Yeah at first it was people who could at least get close.  Like you could at least usually see what the end goal was.

Now it is like, which slop mountain tastes the least bad.  I liked it better when it was more of an actual competition feel"
Nailed It! Germany,Gonna check this out. I'm on a cooking show binge
Nailed It! Germany,Demand for physical media no longer justifies the cost of manufacturing in most cases. Discs are a niche thing now.
Nailed It! Germany,DVD sales are down 82% in the last 10 years. Suspect that for TV shows it’s even worse than that.
Nailed It! Germany,"Well, streaming happened, so the number of people who would've bought stuff on disc dwindled. 

And yeah, the companies would rather rent you content on a monthly basis than have you pay them a flat fee for it once and never again."
Nailed It! Germany,"Studios aren't forcing digital/streaming on you to make more money. In fact, they made more money from physical releases. Selling tapes/discs used to be a huge part of their revenue model.

But now that streaming exists, there's less demand for DVDs. Sure, you want Blu-rays, but overall, fewer and fewer people bought those over the last decade, so studios cut back on making them."
Nailed It! Germany,There isn't a market for them.
Nailed It! Germany,"If you really want to own a piece of media, all you need is piracy and a few hard drives."
Nailed It! Germany,"I prefer physical home media(blu-ray, 4k) as I find the quality to be better than streaming and I also actually own it. I brought every season of Game of Thrones when it was airing and I love the packaging. HBO did a good job with it. Sadly op, streaming has been put as a first priority. Not only for tv but movies too."
Nailed It! Germany,"Nobody buys them or even has things than can play them so what's the point?

(I do, but I acknowledge I am a very small niche consumer)"
Nailed It! Germany,"You can fill 1 room with physical music. 1 room with physical books. 1 room with physical movies and tv shows or 1 room for each of them. 1 room for your physical games and each of the consoles.     

Maybe most just want a single shelf for 1 type of those."
Nailed It! Germany,"Streaming platforms want subscribers, not buyers. If Dark ever gets released on Blu-ray for example, I have less reason to maintain a Netflix subscription."
Nailed It! Germany,YAR matey - there be a way to get what you are looking for.
Nailed It! Germany,"I too have lots of Blu ray movies, not that many TV shows tho, only my all time favourites and Flemish shows. 

Movies alone cost me more than enough, apart from that, I am a binge watcher and I hate having to switch discs when I'm laying down all comfy."
Nailed It! Germany,"I'm definitely spending much less on movies/TV  now that physical is being abandoned.   They've lost money from me,  but, I suppose I'm in the minority"
Nailed It! Germany,I'm glad I got the digital copies of Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Would love to add The Last of Us to my physical library too.
Nailed It! Germany,"I just wish they'd still release bonus material on their streaming sites. HBO did the 10 part making-of series for House of the Dragon, but I really want more of how they made The Last of Us other than those short 5 minute videos that don't really explain much other than the plot."
Nailed It! Germany,"4 years ago I redid my family room, replaced a 14yr old Plasma TV and hung my OLED on the wall.  Connected to the plasma I had the cable box and a BulRay/DVD player.  I hadn’t used the media player for probably 3-4 years before that.  

With the new setup, I moved the cable box to a closet in the room below the TV and ran wires in the wall.  The BluRay and DVD player are gone, but I did connect an HDMI cable to the back of the TV so I could connect a BluRay DVD if I needed to.  I haven’t pulled out the cable in 4 years."
Nailed It! Germany,"Because nobody buys them.

Releasing a movie digitally costs effectively nothing and there's high demand. Releasing a movie physically costs money and only appeals to a dying minority."
Nailed It! Germany,I haven't heard anybody buying a DVD or a blu-ray machine in at least the last five years. It is a dead format. No choice but to move on.
Nailed It! Germany,Are they still making disc players in this streaming age? I'm about to toss my DVD collection.
Nailed It! Germany,">Am I the only one who wants to own physical media 

yes"
Nailed It! Germany,Good to know. Homeland is an amazing show though!
Nailed It! Germany,Buy digitally and then save to a HDD so you have forever.
Nailed It! Germany,"I still love physical media DVD's or BR's.  if a show or movie is no longer being released on either DVD or BR i just torrent the project and burn it on to a blank DVD.  that's at least something.   

i'd rather purchase these things but it they are no longer being put in a physical release then so be it."
Nailed It! Germany,"For the new TV  stuff that comes out on Blu Ray there has been a noticeable drop in the amount of extra features that are included.

Game Of Thrones used to have commentary tracks for every episode (sometimes more than one) and tons of behind the scenes featurettes. House Of The Dragon Season 1 had a fraction of what they used to include on the GOT discs. Definitely a sign that physical media doesn't have the same production budget as it used to."
Nailed It! Germany,I did not even know that DVD/Blu-Rays still existed...... so that might be part of the problem.
Nailed It! Germany,because they thought they'd have them forever. instead they just scour them from earth when they could use a tax writeoff.
Nailed It! Germany,"Because instead of getting your money once for it, they know they can have you pay $20 dollars a month for it on a streaming service."
Nailed It! Germany,I stopped using my playstation as a disc player years ago. They tend to fuck up the optical reader or else put too much load on the fragile eject system.
Nailed It! Germany,"In Germany you are very Lucky.Here in Spain the situation was absolutely crap from decades ago.

-Here you can't buy any show digitally.Prime video and Google don't sell TV shows only móvies. With a very very few exceptions from  Microsoft store and don't fully shows a spare seasons normally.

-Here Many majors refused to  publish the TV shows in blu- Ray. And 4k in TV shows don't exist. Yo can't found here halo un 4k or strange new worlds in 4k.

You can't get old shows in blu Ray only DVD and crap DVDs thats lacks dubbing episodes or other nightmares in the releases Where in Germany are perfect.

-Another shows are left in the middle of the release for example supernatural was drop in season 13, we   never view season 14 and 15 in blu Ray.


-Worst of that majors tend to ignore the spanish dubbing from Spain. And prefer use the dubbing from Latinoamérica or don't include it in foreign releases.

For example take star Trek Prodigy in región 1 they have Germán dub,french dub, and..spanish from Latinoamérica.

Spain TV shows market are absolutely crap."
Nailed It! Germany,It barely even justifies having it on store shelves either
Nailed It! Germany,Additionally not having it on discs increases demand for vod service potentially turning a one time purchase into an ongoing subscription
Nailed It! Germany,I can order 1000 Blu-rays for just $2.85 per disc on the first result I found on Google. How can that be too expensive?
Ares,The girl wanted her dad buried but they were all eating him already lmao
Ares,The visual of Joel’s wristwatch prominently in the shot while he and Ellie reunited was cool.
Ares,"I like how Troy Baker is listed as Video Game ""Joel"" in the BTS after the episode"
Ares,there is 100% a very bad reason why david was a teacher before the outbreak
Ares,"I do like how at first it seemed like they only ate the one guy who died, but then joel finds the whole room full of bodies. so they been at this a while"
Ares,[removed]
Ares,Always wondered how a video game actor as good as Troy Baker would do as a live action actor. The answer is good
Ares,So was the implication that they were eating the girl’s father in the dining hall? (Among many other people evidently)
Ares,"""It's okay, I believe him."" 

So badass and so chilling at the same time."
Ares,That grown man just slapped a little orphan girl in the face and then fed her her father. Eric Cartman would be proud.
Ares,[removed]
Ares,the meat from the soup isn't venison is it...
Ares,"Was David sexually abusing the girls/women of his group? And was that why he had a ""violent heart"" even before the apocalypse?"
Ares,"Bella Ramsey is so good. And Pedro can be so menacing, the interrogation scene he was just oozing bloodlust."
Ares,“I made you eat your parents”
Ares,the actor for david did a great job
Ares,Reverend Rapey McCannibal is certainly a character I don't mind being killed off.
Ares,"Fucking amazing episode, even knowing what was going to happen my entire body was full tense the entire runtime"
Ares,She killed two dudes in the steak house and then set it a blaze. Nice of Ellie to leave the town a cooked meal on her way out.
Ares,I feel like a dumb bitch for taking until the reveal to understand that was who the dead guy was. I want to go back and watch 6 because on first watch the university gang looked like thugs and not the starving congregation we meet in 8.
Ares,"You think Troy Bakers character wanting to kill Elie was actually his way of saving her from all the torture he knew David wanted to do to her, and prevent her from being eaten/ abused?

Edit: something one of the comments by u/swordfiend said  really added to the dynamic: 

I just finished listening to the post epi podcast by niel druckmann, craig mazin, and troy baker for ep 8 and they said that James (troys character) has been completely indoctrinated and brainwashed by david and feels threatened by ellie and wants her dead. David pretty much is thrilled by Ellie because of her capacity for violence and wants to ‘own’ her as his pet at his side. I’d recommend giving that video a listen. They go deep in the psychology of these characters, which gave me a whole new appreciation for the episode."
Ares,"I’m seeing double here!

Four Joels!"
Ares,"""It's okay, baby girl. I got you.""

Oh my heart!!!"
Ares,"James' actor has such a cool voice. I think with a little bit of practice, he would make a decent voice actor."
Ares,"""Baby girl"" 🥺 

Gonna go weep brb"
Ares,"Woman: ""What is it?""

Man: ""It's venison.""

Me: ""That is 100% people."""
Ares,"That was hell of an episode, and it also improved my opinion on episode 6 with how they tied them together. Been a while since I played the game, but they managed to make David just a monster of a human in an hour. I continue to be impressed, and I'm both sad and excited for the season finale."
Ares,"Saved Joel, wiped out some cannibals, killed a pedophile, set the place on fire on the way out... Seems like a pretty good day, all things considered.

Shame about the horse, though."
Ares,"Just a random comment. I can't speak to the specific stab injury but I once had a very bad and untreated infection where I felt like I was dying - high fever, sweats/chills, etc. One stick in my butt cheek and I felt like a new man 24-hours later."
Ares,"For some reason I didn't remember who David was... until I saw the dinner.


Super creepy in the game, and they really captured that in this episode!"
Ares,"Indicative of David’s character - his plate was 4 times larger than everyone else’s

Edit - 4x’s the cannibalism"
Ares,"excellent episode, great writing and editing. the reveal that david knows what joel and ellie are up to is the same as the game, but here it felt much more insidious; david aaaallllmost comes across as authentic at that point, and the needle drop hits a little harder.

my only criticism is that the human stew looked a little too obviously fucked up lol"
Ares,Well that was exactly as harrowing as I remembered.
Ares,"""What's this?"" - ""Venison""

Me: ""Ight David and James came back already""

*David and James proceed to enter with actual venison when dinner is already served*"
Ares,"With one episode left, I just hope Joel gets to throw a bottle or brick to distract somebody at least once. It's practically one of his favorite hobbies."
Ares,[removed]
Ares,That moment you find out she's eating her dad.
Ares,"I teared up when Joel called Ellie, “baby girl.”"
Ares,I’d nit pick Joel’s recovery time if him going John Rambo wasn’t so fucking awesome
Ares,"Yo, when he stabbed that dude in the chest and he choked on his blood, dying eyes wide open, that shit was raw as fuck. They shot that death sequence horrifyingly, and exactly how I’d expect from a series that makes so much of how repulsive violence is; another good example of nailing the spirit of the games."
Ares,"""I believe  him"""
Ares,100% that kid’s dad was the ear
Ares,Oh yeah. That’s that shit I like right there
Ares,Lol in the behind the episode thing they showed that they actually yeeted some stunt double to the ground off a fake horse.
Ares,"They definitely made David creepy as fuck here and I've never been as uncomfortable as I was during that whole segment at the end.. he hints at how he really is, and for some reason it made it much scarier. The series is awesome for really creating a vibe and not being afraid to show the worst"
Ares,That was unbelievably intense. Bella Ramsey was incredible.
Ares,It's an interesting choice to not >!have Joel pull Ellie off in the middle of hacking David to death and move their reunion to outside after the deed is done!<
Ares,Little penicillin and that creepy preacher dude will be good as new
Ares,"On the one hand, I wish the season had a few more episodes.   
On the other, if this was `The Walking Dead` this one episode would've lasted a whole season 😬"
Ares,"How about Troy Baker getting to do some legit live action acting once again?! I hope he gets to do more stuff. He's still got it. 


Which is crazy but every time I was watching Dark on Netflix, I kept thinking one of the characters looked VERY reminiscent of him. Like maybe an English version of the show could be possible. I mean it doesn't have to happen as the show was perfectly fine the way it was...but just in case, I say use Baker for that certain role."
Ares,"Loved the ep, but a question: where were all the other people in the resort at the end there? One of their buildings was raging on fire. Wouldn’t others have come out to see what was going on? Or was that steakhouse in a separate area of their community? I was expecting more of the residents to come and cause more trouble, but they walked off at the end as if those few guys they killed were all there was when we saw at least 20 more people at the beginning."
Ares,"The vengeful passion of Joel trekking across the land with a stab wound to save Ellie after his enhanced interrogations culminating in “it’s okay baby girl” was absolutely perfect. 

One of my favorite quotes from another apocalyptic story is, “In an age of rust, she comes up stainless steel.” And damn if Joel and Ellie aren’t stainless steel survivors."
Ares,"I've really liked Bella Ramsey ever since episode 1, and only grown to appreciate her portrayal of Ellie more as the series goes on. I've still been skeptical of if she'd have the chops to take Ellie where her story goes in Part 2 when that gets adapted. 

Well, she just showed me what a fool I was to doubt. What an incredible, hard-edged performance."
Ares,"The guy brings chunks of bloody flesh in a bin to the cooks in the kitchen and they look at him and he says ""it's venison"".

(But in the next shot the deer is brought in whole through the front door). 

Ughhhhh."
Ares,Excuse me creepy preacher sir but I’d just like to confirm whether the mystery meat passes all the relevant food and safety regulations
Ares,I miss the two openings of the first two episodes.
Ares,"""you have a violent heart"" man they are really setting up for the 2nd game."
Ares,I counted 22 stabs…damn Ellie
Ares,Great episode overall. I wish they could’ve filmed one more episode just to spread out some of the story here at the end and let it breathe a little.
Ares,The conclusion to this episode felt strange. Where did the rest of the community go? Their town hall was burning down and nobody came to investigate? Why did they all just cease to exist? Anybody else think that was specifically kinda weird?
Ares,Absolutely perfect episode. David was an amazing monster in human form.
Ares,DAMN but is it ever a good thing Ellie wasn’t still holding that knife when Joel surprised her from behind 😳
Ares,Holy crap Bella was amazing in this ep. Wowza
Ares,If you’re gonna cook human meat at least sear it first instead of throwing it straight into the tomato sauce.
Ares,Nearly perfect adaptation of the Winter chapter of the game. That final scene gave me goosebumps even when I knew what was happening. Also how awesome was it to see Troy Baker in this? In happy for him.
Ares,"If anyone who didn't play the games is wondering what was different in the show, in the game, ellie and david have to fight off a large horde of infected and a bloater while waiting for that dude to come back with the drugs. Then both joel and ellie kill *a lot* more people in their respective parts. Ellie's escape is a lot more complex as the place she was held isn't the same place she fights david, but the gist of it was the same"
Ares,WHAT A FUCKIN EPISODE! A round of applause for Bella Ramsey and her acting abilities please? She absolutely nailed it tonight! Glad Joel is better and they got to reunite. Can't wait to see the finale next week!
Ares,Ahhhh stealth Joel with no gun kills really copying my playthrough
Ares,Great episode. Love how they explore how the apocalypse has changed some people with Joel torturing and killing those guys contrasted against how the apocalypse has allowed some people to be who they truly are like David.
Ares,"I’m curious what other people think: Do you suppose James and his crew wanted to go against orders and kill Ellie out of a thirst for revenge, or was it because at least a part of them knew that a bullet would be more merciful than what David had planned for her?"
Ares,"Anyone else notice James got the biggest plate of food, but also was just picking at it because he knew what it was?"
Ares,"With David, James and a number of other men in the village dead now, good chance the rest of the village is going to starve to death.

Chilling to think that even the death of bad guys means the death of innocents"
Ares,Where was everyone during the final confrontation? I mean the other members of the cult.
Ares,That is right behind episode 3 as the best of the series. Bella knocked it out of the park and David was a great one episode tyle villian.
Ares,[removed]
Ares,"I wonder how it would be to binge the show, for instance, being able to immediately watch this episode after the last episode which was entirely a flashback."
Ares,Fantastic episode. I love that Ellie killed video game Joel.
Ares,Ellie’s screams while hacking David are soooo chilling and real
Ares,"As a red head who teaches math named David I found this episode frustrating. The villian was too relatable in most regards /s 

Really enjoyed it overall and the above line is legit, but still well done."
Ares,"As someone who’s never played the game I feel like all the people who have played the game are being wildly harsh on things I am blissfully unaware of. I feel zero pacing issues, zero issues with the relationship that joel and Ellie have formed and the pacing thereof, zero qualms with the impact of the characters, etc. 

It’s hard to describe to folks that already know this whole story how much everything is absolutely working. Those folks have, in my eyes, the unfortunate perspective of having a video game to constantly compare this show to. To me, this show is the freshest take on a zombie apocalypse I’ve seen in ages, and am loving it."
Ares,"Part of me wishes Troy Baker would get the drop on Pedro Pascal screaming, ""there can be only one!"" but It was a good episode, and it was nice to see Troy Baker in a cameo."
Ares,"""you remind me of me"" wow fuck you David

What an awesome episode. Totally lived up to what my expectations were. Bella and Pascal are so good."
Ares,God fucking dammit. That episode was perfect...
Ares,That went by so fast
Ares,I wonder if David looks like a clicker now
Ares,Wow she fucked David UP! Little tiny pieces...
Ares,Pretty faithful to the game. Wish that David would have said the line of how is he supposed to explain his broken finger to everyone else. Then Ellie introduces herself.
Ares,"Another fire episode! Bella just knocking it out of the park as Ellie. 

We got a little glimpse of how Joel got things done back in the day.

The actor that played David did a good job, he was very creepy just as he was in the game.

It was cool to see Troy Baker in the show (he voiced Joel in the game).


I hope everyone ready for the season finale, because it's going to be crazy especially if it sticks to the game."
Ares,I wasn't sure how Bella as Ellie would turn out but she has killed it every episode so far.
Ares,The clinking silverware at the beginning of the episode.... *shudder*
Ares,"Fun seeing Troy's cameo on the show (more than a cameo, he had a decent sized roll here)  Im curious his thoughts on it"
Ares,"“It’s okay baby girl, I got you” I AM NOT OK"
Ares,"Holy fuck that episode was intense. There were so many incredible lines of dialogue in this episode too.

The final scene with Ellie in the dining hall literally had my jaw dropped. The emotion Bella showed as she killed the cannibal rapist preacher was next level. What an incredible actress.

I love how this show doesn't linger on side characters. They introduce them, somehow make us invested in just a few minutes and then move on. They don't spend half a season stuck in one QZ. They don't draw out things like Joel coming back from the stabbing. I absolutely love that about this show."
Ares,"the biggest twist from david for me its not that he is cannibal or creep r-----. But that he actually worship cordyceps all along, its his God, find god after apocalypse, etc."
Ares,"The final scene with Bella was fucking terrifying. I know she is a very capable actress, but I didn't think she was capable of channeling *that*. Damn impressive."
Ares,Fuck.
Ares,"Jesus, that was intense"
Ares,They somehow managed to make David creepier here than in the game.
Ares,"I thought it was weird that the fire did absolutely nothing the entire last scene.  Neither of the characters acted like there was a fire and they had a lot of fire cutaways like it was building to something.  After she got out I expected the fire to attract colonists, but they just walked away.  If everything was on fire just for the vibes I think it was done badly."
Ares,"I love that they focus on the more human element of these situations, it’s really a character driven program and you can’t have as much action as the game since it wouldn’t be realistic.

But damn after Joel dropped that “Don’t worry I believe him” line and just murdered the other dude, I’m not going to deny that I’d love to see more of Joel just being a badass out here."
Handsome Siblings,Must be a shock to the system going from almost nothing happening for 90-minutes to non stop drama.
Handsome Siblings,"I just came out of a YouTube rabbit-hole about cops getting busted for DUIs, pedophilia, and racial profiling. In most cases (that I watched), 'busted' was usually some sort of paid vacation. Wrongdoing is rarely admitted.

Although I root for Mackey when I'm watching, I see a gross level of 'ultra-realism' in Mackey/Aceveda's corruption as well.

Had an interesting watch last night with ""The Confession Killer"", featuring a DA who gets arrested after accusing the Rangers of misconduct, only to beat that charge, resign as DA, and go on to be the defense lawyer for the 'Killer'. He tried to sue 'the system', but some parts/people have(had?) immunity like Vic.  
Rangers closed \~200 murder cases, and \~20 of them have been proven (over the decades since his arrest) to have been different murderers. Killers on the street, just for what, some better crime statistics?

I didn't think that these shows would compare that well, but you did a good job. As ridiculous as The Shield can be, I guess I think it's a bit too real as well."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Kind of gross the way they lean into the sensationalism and theatrics. ""experience the fall"" makes it sound like a fucking theme park ride rather than a documentary about a profoundly disturbed murderer with a serious neurological disorder (severe CTE) and a history of childhood sexual abuse. A little bit of a sense of gravity would make this a lot less tasteless."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I hate how they blindsided Gronk with those questions but he handled it like a champ. Belichick would be proud.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Personally getting a bit tired of the 1000th killer show on Netflix. Ah well.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"If you feel like wasting a few evenings of your precious time to glorify a retro serial killa check out the Bundy Confession Tapes series on Netflix. It offers no new information and contains no confessions but you’ll get lots of footage and pics and audio of ole Teddy, America’s favorite psycho and who doesn’t love that?!?!   

Spoiler: Teddy cried and begged for his life as he was led to the chair, and he shat himself when the juice hit him. 

My wife and I watched with her Mother. I can’t remember how many times she made a comment about how crazy it was that such a handsome charming fella was such a scary killer  monster.  Henry Cavill is handsome and charming. TB was a wet fart with mommy issues. How anyone sees a person who’s raped and killed so many young lives as handsome and charming I’ll never get my head around. We need to let that guy die. 

The only thing about the Hernandez show that I can say I like is the exposure CTE will get. I’ll probably watch it too because I’m weak and human."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Netflix needs to stop this.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,So is this covering the second murders he was found innocent of or the first one?
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Right?  He had CTE, abused, taught/told by a culture that he could and should kill anyone who he didn't like. I didn't really need a Netflix documentary on this."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I am on the last episode. Where do they talk about sexual abuse?
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,It was super shitty when Gronk wouldn't answer and the reporter just turned to his dad.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"They have an audience, like it or not"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Id much rather have more crime docs than terrible sitcoms and dramas.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Wow-what a coward. If you are going to take a life/lives and your card is getting punched...don't cry like a woman. What a fucking tool.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Stop what?  Whats wrong with a documentary about Hernandez?
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Story telling about murders is as an age old art form. Used to be through old folk songs like The Pines now it's true crime podcasts and docs.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I'm with you.

I like a good story, but as /rocksoffjagger said, it shouldn't be tasteless killer worship."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Both
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,His story is pretty crazy
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Towards the very end.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"No clue, haven't watched it. But it's well documented that he claimed to have been sexually abused as a child."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,it's me. i'm the audience.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Why are we comparing crime docs to ""terrible"" sitcoms and dramas? I'd rather have terrible sitcoms and dramas than terrible crime docs, and I'd rather have good sitcoms and dramas than good crime docs."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,People are all butthurt about killers nowadays. I miss the old days where serial killers were cool.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Agreed. Look at the psychology of serial killers, by all means, but Netflix definitely lean hard into sensationalism and trying to make it a ""sexy"" crime.

Now, Hernandez should have a documentary devoted to him, but it should be focused on his upbringing, the way being a college star allowed him too much leeway and a life without real consequences, and the traumatic brain damage he likely suffered playing football. It should be asking viewers to consider how we treat stars, and whether that needs to be reassessed."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Me too
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I'm in the audience with you! I would be very disappointed if Netflix quit airing these types of shows!
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Care to elaborate? There are more serial-killer focused documentaries and series than ever. I'd say the opposite- serial killers have never been more popular in media tbh.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,All the things you said “the documentary should be about” is exactly what it is about. Watch it.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,">but it should be focused on his upbringing, the way being a college star allowed him too much leeway and a life without real consequences, and the traumatic brain damage he likely suffered playing football. It should be asking viewers to consider how we treat stars, and whether that needs to be reassessed.

Sure sounds like that could be covered from the trailer."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"The greatest is ""OJ : Made In America.""  On ESPN+.   Won an academy award for best doc.   Brilliant to watch, even if you know nothing about OJ."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"My personal favorites are:

1. The Vietnam War
2. OJ: Made in America
3. The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"The Jinx!!!! The Jinx The Jinx The Jinx The Jinx 

Watch The Jinx"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Don’t fuck with cats
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Hmm. How about Mea Maxima Culpa, The Keepers, Wild, Wild Country, The Wild and Wonderful Whites, The Last Dance, and anything Ken Burns."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I can't name a top three there are so many great ones.  Here are some recommendations.

-  Fantastic Lies
-  When We Were Kings
-  The Fog of War
-  Inside Job
-  Restrepo
-  The Tillman Story
-  Standard Operating Procedure
-  The Vietnam War
-  The War Room
-  Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room
-  Weiner
-  OJ: Made in America
-  The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst
-  The Staircase
-  The Inventor: Out For Blood In Silicon Valley
-  Gimme Shelter
-  An Inconvenient Truth 
-  The Last Waltz"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez," Wild country. 

Shadow of truth. 

Evil genius."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,The Staircase.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Dear Zachary is a documentary film, not a series - but it's absolutely stunning.  Do not read up on it first, just go in blind (trust me)."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Mcmillion$.

It's about a criminal empire based around McDonald's Monopoly contests."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"* The Last Dance (I know nothing about basketball and was still really hooked from start to finish.)
* Sunderland Til I Die (I know more about football and I don’t normally like watching docs about a team that I don’t support but this is far more than just a typical fan-service love-in that sports docs can fall into) 
* Making A Murderer (even though you’ve already seen it, I had to put it there because it’s so good.)"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"The Jinx: The life and Deaths of Robert Durst is peak of the genre. To really appreciate its glory though, watch the movie ""All Good Things"" first. It will make the build up and payoff of The Jinx all that much more impressive."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I really like Real Detective
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I usually end up going through a few of these every few months. From the article, it doesn't sound very good, but I'll probably end up giving it a watch soon anyways.

Unrelated: I randomly check out other articles by the authors of articles I read, and I saw that this guy wrote an article about Don Herzfeldt last November. I'd like to catch up on all of Don's stuff I've missed."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"""There's a control and power there that comes from being this monster.""

Yeah, I'd say he tapped into it."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,FYI He also played one of the IT Techs on HBO's Barry. 
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"He did a spectacular job and the book really changes your perspective about serial killers and what we understand about them.

- Almost all serial killers suffered extremely traumatic childhoods typically sexual abuse by a family member was involved

- Their sexual and violent wires have become crossed such that they cannot derive sexual pleasure without violence. This usually makes sense when you consider the nature of their childhood abuses that generally link directly to the nature of their crimes. Especially in Kempers case.

- While it is depressing to consider that serial killers may be more made than born and it could be anyone given the right circumstances, its hopeful that since they can be created perhaps its possible to heal the damage and identify the signs before its too late. It may not be just that they are born killers and theres nothing we can do.

- Overall the book changed my perspective of criminality in general. Its something that the main characters struggle with throughout the film. Perhaps people arent evil and its more childhood development circumstance and environment that leads people to the choices they eventually make.

Anyway the series did a surprisingly good job of staying focused on the work of the fbi and the raw facts they discovered and i cant stress this enough less about sensationalizing and romanticizing killers for dramatic effect."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Cannot disassociate him from that performance. I saw him in HBO's Barry and was like holy shit the guy that fucks decapitated heads is working for the cops!
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,So he’s basically saying that he risked going homicidal?
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Send the man his Emmy
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I hope to see more of Ed in the next season. Such a great character in the show.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"The thing is, there's not a lot of action here for Ed Kemper. He's just a man, in a room, confined. 

But man o man this performance is skin crawlingly real. Cameron Britton, that's *some* acting.

This and Bob Odenkirk as Jimmy/Saul strike me as similar. The acting is in having the audience slowly realize the abnormal psychology behind all the thoughts, and then showing action that ""looks"" normal. "
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,This is something Will Graham would say. 
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Excellent performance from him in the show. When I read Mindhunter the book,
 I envisioned Britton when John Douglas described his experiences with Kemper. Gave me chills. Great read."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I imagine this is somewhat like what Heath Ledger went through during his performance as Joker
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I got halfway through that series, watched the real interviews with the real Kemper, then watched the rest of the show and immediately couldn't remember which lines were from the real Kemper and which ones were from the actor."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,His last scene in season 1 legit made me jump. 
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Definitely one of the more gravitating and enthralling performances I've ever seen. Kudos to Cameron. 
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,The Kemper performance was awesome. There’s a comparison video on YouTube where they have his acted version next to the real Kemper and it’s so close too real life. Excellent show and book.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Who wouldn't have rage from also being a pre-school teacher?
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,his hug was more frightening to watch that any gore or violence in the show 
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I love how the bad guy from True Detective Season 1 was also in it (I forget his name). He was so brilliant as a Russian mobster in Barry.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Oh shit I thought that guy looked familiar.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,“I’ve never seen someone be happy and angry at the same time...”
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I know this is off subject by comparing fantasy to reality, but... When it comes to fictional crime shows, that’s why Criminal Minds was always one of my favorites. I always liked how they addressed and tapped into that criminals were not always born that way, that trauma is almost always involved. The way they actually humanized some, if not most, of the killers, showing that the darkness came from somewhere instead of just being there since birth."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Mindhunter was such a fascinating read. Changed my perspective on criminality as well. It showed me that there are no clear-cut answers. There never will be.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"It's good to point out that not all victims of childhood rape or violence turn out to become serial killers or commit violent crimes. Which makes the whole question of 'why?' have a whole different layer to it. As it is likely not just down to childhood but other factors too mixing with that trauma. Since many survivors of childhood abuse are able to have non violent lives. 

It's interesting that it doesn't always come out of nowhere either. Some do come across professional counseling or get in trouble with the law. It's just signs are missed or the slip through somehow to escalate further. Some can be charming or seem nice on the surface but some are known to be weird violent bullies too. "

Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"The hardest part about it is where does that leave the victims. The natural reaction to a violent crime is to hate and condemn the criminal, but once you understand what made them it becomes more fuzzy. The biggest thing i took from mind hunter is if we want to have less victims we need to stop throwing criminals in the trash and forgetting about them. We have to empathize as terrible as that sounds and try to learn where it went wrong and why this keeps happening so we can begin to prevent it.

Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I found it at a hospital gift shop in the used book section for $0.25. Need to finally read it.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Yea major discovery wasnt so much that they were victims of child abuse it was that almost without exception (i think only Manson but he never directly hurt anyone) they had all been extremely sexually/emotionally/physically abused and all had a story to tell which was uniquely terrifying. So it was a commonality amongst all serial killers.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I'm with you. 

I host a podcast about unsolved crimes, and (as a result) have spent a lot of time interviewing/speaking with family members, investigators, and others involved in cold cases. 

That kind of stuff - no matter how dark or dreary - can stick with you. It's hard to enter a world of such horrifying loss, and then just immediately check out. Many people just can't do it (myself included). 

One episode I worked on back in December plunged me into a pretty deep depression for a few weeks, and it took a lot (mentally, physically, and emotionally) to get myself out of that mindset. Others have recently come close, but I've been trying to work on my compartmentalization (keeping work at work... that whole spiel). 

Hope you're doing well now, and are able to be proud of your work while also remaining in a good mindset. "
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Man, Nightcrawler fucked me up and I didn’t even have to become part of the world. I get it."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,What did you do for nightcrawler?
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,Besides a difference in recording equipment they do sound a bit alike on delivery and timing. Idk what those other guys are talking about.
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I mean... I don't see the similarity aside from the lines. Different delivery and demeanor. Real Kemper seems a lot more intelligent and personable. The actor's portrayal was a little ""thicker"" and less charismatic, at least in my opinion. I loved the show, and I thought he did a great job, but I don't see much similarity."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"They don't seem that similar tbh. The real guy is much less charismatic. More logical and to the point. Wasn't as close as I thought it was going to be, but I actually liked watching Brittons performance more as a result of his charisma I guess. "
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,*totally not a serial killer*
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,I would 100% watch a Noho Hank spinoff. 
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Also, George Remus from Boardwalk Empire!"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I’ll definitely have to check out this Mind Hunter. It sounds like a fascinating look into the head of some of these people. And indeed. Does it touch on how it also affects the other victims, the family of the killers who get condemned for not knowing their loved one was a killer? I feel like that doesn’t get addressed enough."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"May I ask what podcast? I LOVE a similarly-sounding podcast called Casefile, so (1) if you’re that guy, I’m going to fan-girl; (2) if you’re not that guy, I’d love to add a new podcast to my list, and yours sounds great."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Just saw this, sorry for the massively late reply.  I cut on the TV campaign."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Someone points out that Kemper would want to appear that way publicly, as in charismatic and personable. Maybe the acted version is what he is like without cameras around. At least thats how I give the actor the benefit of the doubt."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"They just purposely played up the intensity and intimidation factor in the show, for obvious reasons. IRL he'd be less creepy to talk to than interesting, I think."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,So long as we get to see more of his [bitmoji or whatever it's called](https://i.imgur.com/m4SX1US.jpg)
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"The book does somewhat, the show does not. The focus of the story is the work this fbi unit did which was largely against what was professionally and societally acceptable at the time and even today. Then its about their interactions with the killers and their struggle to not identify with them or empathize. His partner especially had a very difficult time coming to terms with that they were people who had been destroyed before they became killers and the effect that being around them had on their own psychology and interpersonal relationships."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Baha! I wish. I don't have Casey McCasefile's awesome Aussie accent. =D

It's a similar-styled podcast, called [Unresolved](https://unresolved.me/). I came out at around the same time as Casefile, and - while I'm not nearly as huge as they are - I've gotten to cover some interesting stories and talk to some interesting people. It's been an interesting little project.

If you do check it out, I recommend giving one of my newer episodes a listen. I jumped into the first few episodes without knowing anything about audio production, but I usually try to tackle stories that aren't covered anywhere else (with some exceptions). 

Hope you dig it!"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Moreover, who cares if it’s accurate to the real guy. It’s entertaining. "
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Wow, sounds like I need to get on this show! As soon as I finish NCIS LA, i’ll get right on it! Thanks for the synopsis!"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"I actually listened to your EAR episode a few years back (or whenever it was). Funny running into you here, I’ll have to check more of your stuff. "
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Hey, did you stop uploading your work onto YouTube? "
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Thanks for getting back to me and letting me know. I just downloaded a few of your most recent episodes and look forward to listening while I work tonight. I'll be sure to let you know what I think, but just from the 10 minutes I've sampled, your audio quality sounds great and you're a gifted story-teller/reporter. Seriously, man, I'm legitimately stoked to hear more.

Haha ""Casey McCasefile"" does, indeed, have an alluring voice, but I actually find yours more enjoyable. Mr. Casefile has a bit of the Batman gruff to his voice that I've always found a bit funny and detracting.

Edit: I just wanted to say I'm really enjoying your podcast. I've had the opportunity to listen to the first of your Zodiac episodes, and it's a great listen that drew me in as a listener, no problem. On the off-chance anyone stumbles upon this comment at a later date and is interested, I definitely recommend checking out this podcast. It's certainly similar to the podcast *Casefile*, but I see it as a nice compliment to that podcast, rather than a ripoff."
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Thanks! Yeah, crazy to think that those episodes came out almost three years ago... weird how time flies by. 

Been pretty active with the podcast lately, so you might find some of my stuff interesting. Hope it doesn't disappoint!"
Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez,"Nope! It's still up there! 

Because of advertisements, I usually wait a week or two to upload newer episodes, but I've got most of them up there.

Plunderer,A lot of the problem has to do with licensing issues. Old shows use songs and display old movies in those shows. Plus you have royalties to deal with.
Plunderer,"Fox doesn't have the Disney archives.

In fact, Fox has no archives anymore.

Fox Networks is still owned by Rupert Murdoch, who sold 20th Century Fox studios and all its archives to Disney.

So Fox ain't got shit to air from the past."
Plunderer,"CW has a ton of things on tap like Swamp Thing and Tell Me a Story plus Whose Line.

Otherwise I smell more cheap reality, more movies and rerun hell."
Plunderer,"The History channel (and others like TLC and Nat Geo) should air the great documentaries they made when the stations first went live. I think in most cases these channels produced the content so they should own the rights. In fact, that’s why they stopped doing it - it was cheaper to produce the reality shows they have on now. People watch that so they get good enough ratings to make money from commercial advertising. But it doesn’t make for good repeats.

Lots of people have never seen these earlier shows either because they didn’t have access or were too young when the channels were first available."
Plunderer,"Tangentially related but I recall reading that some old shows like Friends are being digitally updated with current product placement. So an old can of soft drink, for example, would be digitally updated to a new one, or a completely different product inserted. I'm pretty sure this plays a role as the rights holders have a new incentive to charge for airing/streaming. Everything's an ad today."
Plunderer,Become a cord cutter and be happy. I don't know why I was paying $150 a month just for cable and another $108 for high speed internet.
Plunderer,"[CW bought shows from the UK and Canada to fill their line up.](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/cw-summer-schedule-2020-1234637322/)  I'm a little surprised more networks didn't do the same.  CW got TaskMaster, Killer Camp, Being Reuben, and Fridge Wars.  TaskMaster is a great show.  It seems they might be airing season 9 though.  I really think they should have started with season 1.  It's a strong start for a TV series.  

Networks really need to find some content because all these repeats are getting boring.  Even the new shows this season are pretty terrible.  Fox did get a foreign show basically with Celebrity Watch Party which it's just Celebrity Gogglebox."
Plunderer,I saw the Dick Van Dyke Show on CBS the other night.
Plunderer,"I wondered if maybe CBS would play some of their CBS All Access shows on the broadcast stations.  They have shows like Star Trek Discovery, The Good Fight, and the Twilight Zone that they could play the first seasons of while they are waiting, and it could drum up more interest in their streaming service too."
Plunderer,"CBS bought Pluto for this purpose.

Otherwise, they are filling up programming hours with content."
Plunderer,"Rights management. It's one of the biggest issues in the TV industry. Shows are often times produced and aired by different entities. 

For example: [Brooklyn Nine Nine.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nine-Nine) The show is distributed by NBC which I'm guessing means they footed the bill to film it. They then sold the rights to air it on Fox for a few seasons. It now airs on NBC and their streaming platform. 

So even if Fox wanted to air Brooklyn Nine Nine right now to fill the gap in air time, they can't. they no longer own the rights to do so."
Plunderer,"There are rules about network prime time broadcasting original shows so they can't just shut down production to save money. They can't just put up archive content.

In theory they could steal content from cable/streaming siblings, but cable and streaming offer a steady flow of subscriber income, so stripping a successful platform to prop up a failing one might be short sighted."
Plunderer,"CW is airing Star Girl and will start showing Swamp Thing.  I don't think a lot of other shows on DC Universe would work well though.  Titans would really stick out from the network's other DC superhero shows.  And Doom Patrol would need to edit out all the ""fucks"" and that would leave half the episodes completely silent."
Plunderer,"What really would make sense is to have a non-stop COVID channel.  Streaming live from hospitals as people move from testing positive, to getting sick, to respirator, to dead.

Might just get people off the beaches."
Plunderer,"Ad sales.  These old shows won't get the ratings and advertisers aren't interested in buying up time there.  Thats it. The value of these shows is almost nothing, let alone to put on a linear network to sell ads against which is incredibly competitive."
Plunderer,I would love it if the networks started airing or releasing some pilots that never made it to air. They’re sitting on a potential gold mine
Plunderer,"Because consumers want new content. Even if it's extreme mini golf.

And I don't see any networks with a shortage of new programming.

People that watch reruns already do so and already know where to find that content.

There's also an issue with not creating new content puts thousands of people out of work. Most staff does not get royalties from reruns."
Plunderer,[deleted]
Plunderer,They all want you to pay for it.
Plunderer,"Some of it is probably related to people not wanting to watch shows with inferior image quality - even when shows shot on analog video are transferred to  HD, its not the same.

A lot of shows in the past were shot on film and transferred to analog format but the original film was probably not saved.

It would be great if networks began showing old movies but Americans seem to have a big attitude about 'old' content."
Plunderer,"Licensing of music in shows, movies and games should be indefinite."
Plunderer,Some archives in still in tape/film media and is costly both in time and money to digitize and reformat .. This is deep archives
Plunderer,"The CW gobbled up Tell Me a Story (CBS All Access) after it'd ceased production, and it'll air on CW soon.

But, yeah, ABC, NBC, & CBS could fill their grids with shows crossing over from their cable cousins, which would double as advertising for streaming platforms (which CBS should consider for their Star Trek line and Twilight Zone, especially)."
Plunderer,AMC is re-showing all of Mad Men this fall.
Plunderer,"I was psyched that SyFy plaed Harley Quinn, and I have been hoping that FX would show Devs. I still hold out some hope, though it's waning."
Plunderer,TV networks are a joke
Plunderer,"That's how they're handling it in the UK. Nights where they screen all of a sitcom (even though they're all available on demand), soaps from 2008."
Plunderer,All their old programming is now considered racist and offensive.
Plunderer,"Network television is repetitive garbage.

The lack of arcs is obvious when binged, too. 

Even pioneers like X Files are barely watchable bar a select few.

Television quality has skyrocketed."
Plunderer,"I feel the same way about Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.  They could be doubling down on updating their libraries with new movies and shows knowing that everyone is at home binging right now, but instead they’re just continuing with the same old slog."
Plunderer,"Yes. Daria got hit hard by this during the DVD releases because the artists wouldn't renew the license so they had to edit the music out. Veronica Mars also had this issue where they used licensed music throughout season 2; hell, they even had an ad for the song before the end credits.

Then you've got the issue of licensing to *other* networks. I don't know about any American examples since I don't live there, but there was a bit of a screw-up when Murder, She Wrote was licensed to the UK; seasons 1-6 are broadcast on 5USA which is owned by ViacomCBS UK and Ireland, but seasons 7 onward are still licensed to ITV. And as far as I know, there are channels in the US which broadcast repeats of older shows, so they may take precedent on airing older shows."
Plunderer,"I think it's also to do with contracts surrounding repeats - one of the reasons iPlayer in the UK doesn't have all the BBC's archival content is to do with different union agreements, [which this article explains neatly](https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2019/01/there-are-very-good-reasons-why-bbc-can-t-just-load-iplayer-archive-content). Obviously in more recent years contracts surrounding repeats would've changed, but I'd guess there's something broadly similar in play here still."
Plunderer,"Television networks typically only license shows for three airings.  Anything in excess of that, would require a new license.   Their parent company may also own a studio that produces shows, but licensing content from them without paying full market fees tends to result in lawsuits by profit participants, such as actors and producers.

Most pilots that haven’t aired are bad.  Often, embarrassingly bad.   Networks have no incentive to air them if they haven’t already picked them up to series.  Even if a pilot were well received, it would be a long time before you’d have subsequent episodes, at which time, most people will have forgotten it.   While there are some pilots that are actually pretty good, the fact that they didn’t make it series typically shows that there is little network support for the projects. 

Occasionally, you will see some content being shared between corporate siblings.   The Disney Sing-a-long special aired on ABC, The Disney Channel, and Disney+.   However, a lot of cable content has to be edited to be legally airable on broadcast television due to FCC issues."
Plunderer,"I bet that is not THAT big of a problem, a lot of old shows are airing already on non-network broadcast channels."
Plunderer,"Ah, my bad! I thought the network was owned by Disney now too! I guess they can suffer then."
Plunderer,They could show the Best of Fox News Collection.
Plunderer,Well....FXX is basically a nonstop Simpsons marathon so they can air it. They sold the streaming rights but it’s theirs to air on broadcast/cable.
Plunderer,"Um, Disney owns Fox entertainment now. The Murdochs split off the News division from the entertainment division.

Where this leaves the FOX TV 'network' I am not entirely sure. But Disney would own the film and TV production element."
Plunderer,"I don't mind seeing more movies on TV, actually. But I hate reality shows."
Plunderer,"They've already done that with How I Met Your Mother.  I watched an episode a few years ago on syndication and noticed a calendar with an ad for a local car dealership here in Georgia behind Robin in her apartment.  Checked Netflix to be sure and yup, no calendar in that version.

Also was watching an old episode of My Name is Earl where they were talking with a billboard behind them advertising a movie that was coming out in a couple weeks.

It'd be weird in shows like Friends if they put in a Nokia ad somewhere when so many episodes would have been resolved with a simple cell phone call."
Plunderer,[deleted]
Plunderer,Who charges that much for internet?
Plunderer,"For the last several years, I have thought that re-broadcasting foreign TV is really underutilized by American TV.  They have been successes for decades - Masterpiece Theater/Fawlty Towers/Absolutely Fabulous with mainly British shows.  But there's a whole world of shows out there. Some of it is available for streaming, but there has to be money making opportunities for networks as well."
Plunderer,Carl Reiner died which may have had something do with that.
Plunderer,"And it had the most viewers of all the networks that night, too."
Plunderer,"Some old shows like that and I Love Lucy are lucky in that they were shot on film. As long as the film itself is saved it can be easily transferred to HD and still have good (if not better) image quality.

Something like All in the Family that was shot on video has a lot bigger problem being shown on HD."
Plunderer,"> CBS All Access shows on the broadcast stations.

They showed season 1 of The Good Fight on the network station last summer."
Plunderer,"Rights are a big deal for music, I don't think its as much of an issue for a TV network showing its 'own' old shows.

They may have to wait for syndication rights to clear for non-network channels but that would be about it.

Seems like CBS has been very smart in retaining complete rights to The Twilight Zone for a while now."
Plunderer,"Sorry but no... Brooklyn Nine Nine was a Fox show seasons 1-5, though originally produced by Universal for s1 as part of a developmental deal they had with Schur. When Fox cancelled it, the show was then picked up by NBC a day after the Fox cancellation, NBC stating they regretted not picking it up from day 1. I am sure there were some arrangements made between the companies regarding streaming rights, but people like Michael Schur who co-created B99 probably have stipulations in their contracts that allow them to take their creative licensing or intellectual property to another production company if terms of a contract are broken or otherwise expire. We are seeing that more these days with shows ending on cable TV, only to be picked up by streaming services like Netflix and Hulu later, I.e. arrested development."
Plunderer,Stargirl was announced for CW well before the shutdown.
Plunderer,"Eh, maybe. But if you are CBS and you air the Good Fight as a first cable run, is that really going to sell worse than repeats of... whatever the hell they're running right now?"
Plunderer,The ratings must be tanking with all the constant repeats.  Airing some older shows and movies could work.  They already aired Indiana Jones a few weeks ago.
Plunderer,I think the value of ads is falling at the moment anyway - because people are generally buying less at the moment - so there's probably extra incentive there not to do things that'd devalue them more.
Plunderer,[deleted]
Plunderer,"Seconding *Taskmaster* - and you don’t have to wait, their official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT5C7yaO3RVuOgwP8JVAujQ) has been adding full episodes every week, up to series 6 so far."
Plunderer,Yeah I’m in the UK and that’s what made me think of it. I’m suddenly seeing classic soap reruns and Channel 4 re-airing old episodes of Big Brother and most channels picking up classic American shows to air
Plunderer,"
>They could be doubling down on updating their libraries with new movies and shows

From where?

Also Netflix releases at least one movie a weekend and a bunch of shows every week. How much more could they do?"
Plunderer,The Simpsons used to be a mess in the UK - at one point it was on at least four channels depending on the season.
Plunderer,"The Drew Carey Show likely will never be released on DVD because there was so much classic rock on the show, [often directly integrated into the plot.](https://youtu.be/ZDkWRP67Es0)"
Plunderer,[deleted]
Plunderer,"I imagine some of the retiscence has other motives. For example them not showing old Doctor Who episodes. If they can stream the entirety of the Who backlog on Twitch for free, I'm sure they'd be able to finagle the rights to stream them over either iPlayer. This was before BritBox too, though I suppose it's possible there were rights talks in progress by that point."
Plunderer,Thats not entirely true. Disney does own 20th Century TV which produced shows like the Simpsons and 24.
Plunderer,You can't own more than one broadcast network.
Plunderer,"Disney owns FX/FXX.

Fox Networks is News, Sports, and the OTA channel. The rest of the cable channels outside of sports and news went to Disney.

So, odds are Fox only has first broadcast and a rerun or two of new episodes."
Plunderer,"Disney acquired 21st Century Fox which was their former studio. Fox Entertainment is the new studio Fox created in 2019.

They still co-produce some of the shows that air on their network and channels like Masked Singer. They are still developing new shows which they own the rights to. Fox Entertainment also own the animation studio Bento Box which animates Bob's Burgers and other stuff like Apple's Central Park."
Plunderer,Stuff like Holey Moley has been fun.
Plunderer,">a calendar with an ad for a local car dealership here in Georgia 

Having a local ad placement like that on a nationally syndicated show is unlikely at best. The show is sent to all stations at once. Is it possible? Sure. I've just never heard of it and am involved in the business and work with these shows daily, HIMYM included."
Plunderer,You must be close to a major US city I'm betting. I'm close to New York city if 10 hours is considered close lol
Plunderer,I live in NYC - I think I have about 60 OTA channels
Plunderer,My cable company for business internet. I'm averaging over 2 TBs a month in bandwidth and they don't care. Family of 4
Plunderer,Person you are replying to said they paid that much for cable
Plunderer,Agreed.  Some shows wouldn't fly well with the general US audience but there are some shows that could do great.  The topical panel shows might be hard for some to understand but they could work but probably on cable.  It would be nice to get some actual British shows on BBC America.  I checked the channel right now and it's Star Trek marathons from 3am to 8pm then with American movies.
Plunderer,"Thanks to streaming services, I'm beginning to sample British shows like My Mad Fat Diaries, Please Like me and Chewing Gum that have long stagnated on my list of shows to watch."
Plunderer,It did
Plunderer,"And it was in color. I don't remember it ever being in color, although I must admit we didn't own a color tv back then. Yeah, I know, it was probably colorized, but they did a great job."
Plunderer,"Nothing you wrote contradicts what I said. Thanks for contributing though. The point remains, Fox had the rights to air the show in the first several seasons and no longer does."
Plunderer,But it was produced by NBC. Aired on Fox. Exactly what OC said.
Plunderer,"Yes, probably, and those ads are likely already sold anyways.

Also, when you're talking about CBS-- do you mean the actual CBS owned stations? Or affiliates? Prime time or not prime time? These are all different concepts there that make a huge difference.

If you're just saying CBS in general, usually meaning an individual affiliate, outside of prime time, they don't have the CBS library, they just own whatever content they own"
Plunderer,CBS is also trying to convince people to pay for CBS All Access.
Plunderer,lots of people are probably still used to not having new shows during the summer
Plunderer,"They know what they are doing. They’ve got a lot of analytics and such., you’re instead, just guessing."
Plunderer,Ad rates have been in the shitter since COVID started.
Plunderer,Its comedy gold.
Plunderer,Some people are just never satisfied
Plunderer,"I know of BBC2, Channel 4 and Sky One... but what was the fourth?"
Plunderer,That's a good thing.
Plunderer,"Man that sucks, I forgot all about that show just because it's never in syndication"
Plunderer,"Recent Daria reruns (like those seen on MTV and MTV Classic back in 2016) use the DVD soundtrack. They've altered the soundtrack in reruns of Clone High and The State too, and MTV/MTV Classic hasn't aired Beavis and Butthead episodes outside of the 2011 reboot in forever because of the music videos."
Plunderer,"You can and many companies and networks do, but its complicated. As with everything in broadcast TV in the US, there's a lot of exceptions.  But certainly the SEC and FCC would not allow a company to own more than 1 of the big four, but the smaller networks have a lot of combined ownership with the big four and each other"
Plunderer,"Well, technically you can't own more than 1 of the big four networks in the US. Viacom/CBS owned both CBS and UPN from 2000-2006, and has been a 50% stakeholder in the CW since launch."
Plunderer,If only that were true
Plunderer,"Welp, I stand corrected. I had no idea. Sneaky mouse..."
Plunderer,"On the sports side, they sold all their RSNs and only kept FS1.

Which Disney then has to turn around an sell them anyway to appease the Govt."
Plunderer,They also have Fox Business. They also own MyNetworkTV.
Plunderer,thanks for the correction.
Plunderer,"The reason it stood put to me was because there was an ad for a car dealership from here in a New York apartment. It was really out of place.

This would have been on either TBS or Peachtree TV (local television station owned by Turner Broadcasting that plays syndicated shows) here in Atlanta."
Plunderer,[deleted]
Plunderer,Living the dream.
Plunderer,"I meant what company, obviously."
Plunderer,"Universal produces the series. You are right that Fox no longer has the rights to air the show, that contract ended when they cancelled the show after s5, but my comment was trying to differentiate between Universal production and NBC broadcast. They are not one in the same. NBC didn’t sell B99 to Fox, universal did."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Lmfaoo I tried watching the first episode yesterday. I liked it until the absurdity of the scene with david tenant and the tutor with the flashdrive. No idea why he didnt just tell her it was the kid in church (who clearly needs professional help). Instead we get a completely ridiculous conflict where the tutor falls and hits her head 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and eventually falls down the basement stairs??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 All because these idiots cant communicate

I turned off the show right after that scene"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I watched it for David Tennant. Figured if he was in it, couldn't be bad. I was wrong. Still love him though."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,[deleted]
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,How they wrote that part of the show....unbelievable but i still had fun with the show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I just finished the first episode and I agree that Tennant's character made a series of increasingly stupid decisions.  He doesn't have any legal or moral obligation to protect the pedophile's identity, so there was no reason for him to not just tell her who the flash drive really belonged to and clear his son's innocent name in the process.  I don't even understand why he kept the flash drive to begin with instead of immediately destroying the thing, which would've avoided this whole mess.

I think the teacher should've been more open to the flash drive not being the kid's though, especially considering how nonchalant he was about her seeing its contents.  Did she really think someone his age would be so cavalier about their teacher seeing actual child porn?  That said, I liked how she basically saw no way out of the situation and so made certain to leave as much evidence as behind to really screw Tennant's character over for her likely eventual murder.

I've really enjoyed the Tucci and Estimond side of things though."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"It’s one of the worst written shows this year. So many truly unbelievable choices made by David Tennant’s character. There’s been a few threads on this show now and every one is the same. 

The show is terrible"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Janice is fucking stupid. Everyone acts stupid.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I stopped watching after the first 10 mins that scene in the train is terrible.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Just an FYI that you can't just watch the prison bits and skip the Tennant bits. The two are entirely intertwined.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Convicted death row inmate turned Sherlock, with an intriguing backstory that is never explored, and, on the other side of the pond, an upstanding vicar who kidnaps the nun from Dracula. How will the show tie these two plotlines together? Spoiler, it won't.

Convince me this wasn't planned as a 20 episodes thing that was ultimately cut down to four for whatever reasons."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Funny how people in the comments are comparing Tucci's character with Sherlock Holmes and not with Hannibal Lecter.

Anyway, this is probably the stupidest show I've seen in my life and the only way I could finish it was at 1.5x and skipping all the parts that felt absolutely insufferable.

Everything is so bad. The premise, the plot, the camera work, the choice of music. I really feel for the cast who were put in this position."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I'm halfway through episode 2.

&#x200B;

Janice annoys me, why on earth wouldn't she listen to Fr. David Tennant lmao?"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I just got the part of the flash drive and it’s so stupid I don’t know if I want to continue. To protect a deeply troubled man that is a pedophile because he might commit suicide. But who cares about the kids or any crime he may commit in the future????!
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I just finished it and my jaw was on the floor for the majority of the show because I am just absolutely astonished at how unseemly, banal, unbelievable and lazy the writing is. One misunderstanding after another immersed with well worn cliché after cliché.  A very unsatisfying ending to an abysmally horrid show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I agree with all the the criticisms of this stupid show but I still really liked it. It’s a bit like those Harlen Corbin adaptations Netflix keeps making. Nonsense but very enjoyable nonsense
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"There is two shows here, one carried by Tucci and Estimond and another buried by the rest."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,It’s a television show bro. Chill.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Glad I came here to save myself any more time invested; removed from my list. I'm sad to see David Tennant in this role.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Yes, I agree. I kept thinking about that floppy disk that led the FBI to the BTK killer in the mid 2000s, and how downloaded files that are saved on a memory device will have some reference to the computer's ID string or name.

And of course, the computer's registry automatically tracks USB device history and creates unique IDs for each device. So had the vicar simply told the police the truth, their forensics team could quickly match the flash drive's metadata to Edgar's computer registry, to validate the story. The vicar's response to the know-it-all tutor was completely implausible.

I found myself incapable of watching most of the vicar's scenes. It was so frustrating and stupid. So I watched the show strictly for Stanley Tucci (his character, at least, was interesting and the story line plausible)."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Also what the fuck is the deal with the OVER USED ""gOdS gOnnA cUt yOu dOwn"" music?! 

To those who haven't seen it, I am NOT exaggerating when I tell you that I heard that song FIVE TIMES!!!"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Stupidest fuckin show on Netflix. I stopped paying for this garbage subscription after watching this show. Another clear attempt to push the lefty agenda down people’s throats. Oh yea everyone is capable of killing NO SHIT SHERLOCK but we’re fuckin reasoning humans. What a shit show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Watching it right now and that scene just happened and was so stupidly implausible that I hopped on reddit. Like that’s how you handle that situation? Makes more sense to implicate yourself/ your son, threaten the safety of the math tutor, and not deal with the safety of harmed children because a pedophile might self harm further? Like what?"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I just paused at this scene to look for reviews before I invest any more time in this garbage 😂
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I just started watching this show. What I found immediately stupid was: 

1. The son was totally cavalier about it being his porn (of course the plot is he was trying to cover for his dad in an effort to get money). Like if it was truly his and he just got caught with illegal porn he wouldn't been cavalier about it.

2. She's been tutoring him for months (at a minimum) if I understood correctly. She should know his character and personality quite well at that point.

Yet her immediate and foregone conclusion is that it is his beyond a shadow of doubt? What???? Is she stupid?

Well I kept watching and she is indeed stupid. I think the writers are trying to make her seem 'clever', but everything she's done that I've seen thus far is just antagonize her captors and make it worse. She's basically begging to be murdered every episode."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I tried this show earlier today and turned it off halfway through the first episode. Decided to check Reddit to see if I was just overreacting to one bad scene

Glad I saved myself 3.5 hours of “this is going to get good eventually, right?”"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Edited, don't know how vicar turned into iCarly"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Im halfway through the first episode, and although David has been making stupid decisions, I find the teacher more annoying.  Why the heck was she so hell bent on reporting the kid, even after David told her its not either of theirs?  The kid was obviously covering for the dad, and the dad was covering for one of his patrons.  If she just left it alone, Im sure the priest would have gone to the authorities about the true owner of the porn. But the stupid lady was so instant SHE be the one to do it.  It was annoying."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Apparently I should have scrolled down a bit further before writing my first reply. That was my point to: why would she be so convinced it was his with him acting so cavalier about it. Edgar's reaction when confronted and realizing he'd been caught by the Vicar would have been the son's reaction when Janice 'caught' him (or at least something close to it).

I agree leaving her DNA and what not all over the place was fairly smart, but that was about it. Everything else thus far (I haven't finished yet) that she has done seems like the writers trying to make her seem 'clever' but to me it just comes off as antagonistic, forcing her captors into a corner where their own solution is murder. She has been downright stupid if you ask me."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I have wondered if there has been a reddit question thread on this.

What would you, parent, do if your child was a rapist, pedophile etc.  Most parents do seem to deny, protect.  But maybe I've gotten that from shows lije this.  And cases lije the Brock Turner case  football player rape cases"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Yea everybody is dumb but she’s the worst cuz she thinks she’s so smart
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Lady can’t stop, think, and listen for a moment. Her stubbornness is unreal"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Same! Was rolling my eyes so hard at that, don't think I even got to the 10 minute mark."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I’ll just watch the David tennant parts for the eye candy in this show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"So so annoying, I had to put basement scenes on 1.5 speed"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Apparently, according to Brits, its,a dark comedy.  The absolute absurdity of stupid decisions.  Not sure it's translating"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Same. Just finished it and I have that *I wanna stare out the car window and think* feeling going on. Maybe I have bad taste, which is fine, but I thought it was a gr8 show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Don't flat line on emotion, dude"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Oh wow, didn't even think about the computer I'd stuff, so yeah totally implausible.  I've seen where Brits say is a comedy so I think us yanks didn't get it.  Regardless I think it was out there.  Which is great that weird things get produced."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Unfortunately many tv shows have these kind of tropes. The lazy writers have to give the characters irrational stupid decision making in order to develop any kind of conflict to keep the plot going
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,SAME HERE
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Are you drunk right now.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"But it wasn’t their kid. It was a troubled grown man who he barely knew. It made no sense for his character to do what he did. A loose “oh the dudes suicidal wah wah” but that would be an even bigger reason to call the authorities and get him help. He was cutting even before any police involvement, makes no sense to protect him from it. 

Instead he very neglectfully and controlling my manhandled and assaulted a woman over and over. 🤣 Highly unrealistic and nonsensical even for the standards built up in the show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I think the down vote shows that parents protect their porno Pedro's and rapists.  Just like this show
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I think she is suicidal and actively wants to be murdered.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Yeah it was the worst part, it felt like a bad fanfiction that had no buisness with the other part of the show."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Just finished 2nd episode and might as well finish it with spoof comedy of genre in mind. Kinda like the series *The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window*
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Still a television show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Huh, that's interesting. It wasn't marketed as a comedy but it definitely has elements of a screwball comedy--which explains why I disliked it so much (that subgenre always makes me frustrated and annoyed because it's so avoidable). Interesting insight. Thanks"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,*The Woman...* was a spoof comedy? I started it and couldn't watch it. I must've missed the point.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Yes it's a comedy making fun of all the cliches of the genre, all exaggerated. Even the title is a joke"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Righteous Gemstones is lampooning Christian mega churches. It’s not a religious show.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I'm a big fan of Danny McBride and Co.


What I love most is his ability to let his co-stars shine. Alot of writers who also act would want to have the best lines but in all his shows his co-stars are the ones who truly bring the laughs. Stevie is my favourite comedy character ever."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,All three are top notch. You don't need to be a Christian to enjoy Gemstones lol
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Kenny Powers is his greatest role and it's not even close

Too many quotables"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"In reference to The Righteous Gemstones, a satirical take on the lives of a family that runs an Evangelical megachurch, you said:
“…but outside of the religious tone it was pretty great.” 

What in the hell is even that?"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"If you want to dig through the internet you might be able to find an old clip of him on his promo tour for ""The Foot Fist Way"" (dark comedy about a shitty kids karate instructor) where he was on Late Night with Conan back in the mid 00's. He came on in character with some of his students to do a karate demonstration (punching boards, flips, etc.) and was berating the kids constantly for screwing up.

This was before people knew who Danny McBride was so they thought it was some drunk guy legitimately yelling at kids for ruining his big late night appearance and the audience was *very* uncomfortable the whole time (Conan as well, maybe he was in on it, I don't know). I remember watching it when it aired and feeling the same then seeing him in Tropic Thunder or something the next year and laughing my ass off realizing what he did."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"All three are great but Vice Principals is the best imo. It really benefits from having such a tight storyline that appropriately evolves throughout the entire show and a satisfying finale. It just feels like such a complete story with no filler or boring, distracting b and c plots to fill time. Not only are the characters fantastic (Lee Russel is the funnest character out of all three shows imo) but the way the show changes course or changes tone throughout the story is really fun. Great pacing."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"If you haven't seen it already, This is the End is an absolutely hilarious Danny McBride performance."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,“You’re fuckin out!”
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,The Foot Fist Way
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I too just showed these to my girlfriend and she loved them. 

They do an incredible job of humanizing awful people.

Agree that Vice Principals is the best one."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I’m from Southeast NC and I love Righteous Gemstones! Hits the nail precisely on the head as far as Christian hypocrisy goes. Also love his other comedies. Dude is one of NC’s favorite sons!
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,everything he has been in is fucking amazing. and walton goggins ffs same thing.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"i've been trying to let everyone know about the gemstones. a couple episodes into the second season and i think it's just as good as eastbound and down, which i think is one of the funniest shows ever made. the crew that makes these shows just nails the type of comedy they are going for. always perfect casting too."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Vice Principals is illegally funny. 

I went on a Danny McBride rampage after Righteous Gemstones, and VP was soo goddamn funny. Man what a series lol."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"The frustration in his voice when he screams (I think in episode 1, it's really early) ""I'm Kenny Powers!"" during an argument with his brother is hysterical to me. I can't not crack up watching it. The prince trying to command the tides."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka, McBride is funny as hell especially if you grew up white trash and actually knew people like his characters. Saying he nails it is an understatement.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Eastbound & Down is super awesome, Vice Principals is really great.

I wish these were available on Netflix!"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,How in the absolute fuck could Edi Patterson not get mentioned in this post????
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"The man is absolutely top tier. 

I'd fallen off of Eastbound and down and never gone back to it, then watched vice principals as it was airing and ended up going back to eastbound and down while waiting for VP S2. What a fuckin treat that was. Don't know why I ever stopped watching I'm the first place."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Did you feel it in YOUR PLUMMMMS?
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,“I love you in a make me cum kind of way”
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I actually found S2 of Gemstones to be pretty bad.  Especially Kelvins storyline, that shit was absolutely awful."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"> McBride's first HBO show, it started off to be a little mediocre

You are saying this precisely because you watched the other shows first.  At the the time EB&D came out, it was a monster hit and the talk of every water cooler in every office."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Not my cup of tea.  I gave up on him after Eastbound and Down when I decided he always plays the same loud obnoxious narcissist character.

People tell me that Righteous Gemstones is good but I am now at the point that I won't enjoy something just because he is in it."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I really haven't been able to get into Righteous Gemstones. Adam Devine is extremely grating and is too transparent of an actor - even when he's playing different versions of himself, he's still always basically just himself. 

I couldn't stand Edi Falco in Vice Principals so I don't know if I can handle her increased role here."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I liked VP, gemstones was alright. East Bound (I know came before) but I just didn't like it."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"> Vice Principals, and Eastbound & Down

Ugh, no."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Interesting I’ve always heard Season 2 of EB&D fell off but came back strong in season 3
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,He don’t miss! I’ve loved every show he’s made.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Who wants to suck an old man’s dick?
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I fuckin' love his shows.
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"I could not agree with this more. I had the same realization in the winter. I’ve always been a huge McBride fan (Eastbound & Down is hilarious) but I didn’t see Vice Principals or Gemstones until this year.

And as much as I love Eastbound & Down, I absolutely love Vice Principals. Yes the whole Gamby/Russell thing is classic and insanely funny, I couldn’t get enough"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Danny mcbride and walto goggins is a good duo
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Gemstones is fantastic, it starts out trying to make you hate everyone but with time you actually grow sympathetic to most of them and realize that while they're kind of shitty people that take advantage of people's faith, they're mostly just a product of their environment, and all have a good side and slowly grow as characters."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"great rec, thank you"
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"At the same time, it’s pretty respectful to religion/Christianity. It doesn’t mock Christians, even the ones who might find an appeal in a megachurch. Even the Gemstones- their faith is not what makes them foolish and they seem to believe in what they are doing."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I really don’t understand how OP can watch that much Danny McBride stuff and still get wooshed so hard that he thinks Gemstones is a religious show lmao
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"In Stevies voice: ""A sock on the the doorknob is the international sign that someone is getting laid. AND IT WAS ME DOOOG!"""
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I feel like christians would be the minority in liking it. Especially the groups that love Joel Osteen
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Right. In my eyes the show shits on religion, especially the mega churches."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Practice is the crutch of the talentless
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,I can throw a ball faster than fuck!
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"""Can I wear the Scream mask? The mask from Scream? When I do you from behind?"""
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Hehehe...what's his name? Shrek?
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"They also said Eastbound and Down ""started off to be a little mediocre"" so it's important to remember that anyone, literally anyone even the bar drunk, can make a post in this sub with their all important opinions."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"My thought too. Does op think the show is trying to glorify Christianity? Or that they are trying to proselytize? If so, the whole theme just went way over their head."
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,Daddy chill
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,the foot fist way is a translation of Tae Kwon Do
GTO: Great Teacher Onizuka,"Conan was definitely in on it, he just has to play the straight man for the joke."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"That's crazy that it's premiering and finishing all within 10 months.

Really felt like it has more than 10 episodes to go to finish the story, though.  Who knows how it'll end."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Didn’t this show just debut this year?
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Someone on the Adventure Time sub recommended this show recently... Looks pretty interesting.  I'll have to add it to my list.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"First season was good, very creative. Second season was great, amazing surprise with a very good story for the villain.

Can't wait for season three!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I'm sad that it's already ending but glad it gets to tell it's story in full the way it intended.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Scarlemagne's story really hurt my emotions. 

Ready to be hurt again."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Yet to finish the first season, thought it was stellar nonetheless."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,What is this show of sounds stilid like trump
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"She-Ra also had 5 seasons in 2 years. Its incredible, I don't know how they do it.

If Cartoon Network did this Steven Universe would've been done in 2 years instead of 6."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Yep, Dreamworks TV Animation/Netflix has a tendency to split a full 20 episode season up into parts, so they likely had the first 20 done around the same time, but only released those first 10 episodes and classified them as “Season 1”."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting Master of Darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish Samurai warrior wielding a magic sword stepped forth to oppose me. Before the final blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time and flung him into the future, where my evil is law! Now the fool seeks to return to the past, and undo the future that is Aku!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Apparently its got one of the strongest starts to an animated show, or so I've heard. The fact the entire 3 seasons are releasing within a year is insane."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Steven Universe had like, the single worst schedule of any show I’ve ever seen. Love the series but it was painful to be a fan many times"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Six seasons and a movie in six years is genuinely quite fast, though."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,They pretty clearly designed each 10 episode chunk as it’s own season at least. It’s not like those six and seven episode “seasons” of She-Ra or Voltron where they clearly had no idea it was being split up when they wrote it.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I'm actually wondering if it was a full 30 episode order and then they split it up into 3 seasons.  Netflix usually likes to see how well a show's first season would do, like with Trollhunters, before ordering more.  But S2 only 6 months after S1, and S3 only 4 months after S2?  There's no way they waited until after the first season to premiere before ordering more, that's nowhere near enough time for to make it."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Which is kind of the opposite of *Trollhunters* where the first season is really two.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,And it has some great music!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"It's been a while, but I feel like Gravity Falls' airing was more of mess than SU's. Venture Bros was also a whole thing, 7 seasons over 17 years, but at least those mostly aired a season at a time."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"The best way to watch the show is to binge watch it. I would basically avoid spoilers for a whole year and binge watch a Season in a day. It was nuts.

It became my favourite cartoon of all time though so totally worth it. I feel like this show will also age well."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Seems like it but the release schedule was a mess. So many hiatus' where production on episodes were done for almost a year and not aired. Or almost 1 year gap between episodes. The first Season alone also took about 1.5 years to air, and the 5th season took 1.5 years, with 3/5 of the episode count of S1."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,They probably saw it firsthand with those other shows (or talked with their showrunners) and knew ahead of time to write it like so.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"On twitter the creator says that the show was always intended to be 3 seasons, and that’s what Netflix greenlit them for. He said the whole series was done being written by May of last year"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"The DreamWorks shows are an anomaly. They get picked up for their entire runs from the beginning - I definitely remember Voltron being mentioned as being 78 episodes from an early point on, and the same goes for She-Ra's 52 episodes."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"You love to see it, always great to see when a creator has a plan mapped out from the beginning and the network/streamer is cool with that, 30 episodes is a good amount to commission"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"This show is phenomenal. The animation is absolutely stunning, and the story and world are incredibly interesting. I really hope this catches on because this show has quickly become one of my favorites."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"This was great. Really liked how the music lined up with what was happening in each scene. That cliffhanger ending though, it'll be real disappointing if it doesn't get renewed. I'm a bit worried as I haven't seen much advertising for the show or a ton of people mention it outside dedicated discussion threads. I'll try to get some more people to watch it."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I just binged this today (home sick with a cold) and I adored it. This show was such a wild, creative, ride.

I want to describe it but I feel like most of the joy of the show is just experiencing all of the characters as they're revealed.

Twisted gangs of talking animals all have their own styles, personalities, and musical themes which play when arrive. The fight sequences have a bit of a Samurai Shamploo vibe. The soundtrack in general shines as unusually varried, with rock, R&B, soul, hip-hop, folk, synth, EDM, amongst other genres here and there.

It's just a lot of fun to watch. Enjoyable characters, fights, and visuals. It needs more episodes, so watch it!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"This is why people should look into Netflix cartoons more often. They're actually pretty damn good, great music, great VA's. I liked how the main character (a.k.a. Kipo) was voiced by the same person who voiced a character from the Netflix show She-ra, Glimmer of Brightmoon."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Gave me the same feeling I got from watching Futurama the first time, absolute gem"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I will never not refer to the bees in the show as RGBees.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Amazing show. Really hope that it gets the numbers that Netflix is looking for. I don't want it to end without every person involved in the creative process coming to a satisfying conclusion. It definitely is on its way to carving a spot in the greats of cartoons, IMO."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"This is a wild ride. The animation is so fluid and dynamic it feels like you're in there. Every environment is beautifully and lovingly rendered, the sense of scale is tremendous and the colors are alive and harmonious. The voice cast is super talented and the soundtrack is hands down the best I've ever heard on any series ever, it's eclectic and diverse and perfectly matched to every scene. The jokes are actually funny and the scenes where things explode actually make you go 'holy shit' like they're supposed to. Dialogue is perfectly balanced and nothing feels cliche. 

More importantly to me... the theme throughout the show with Kipo's self-realization is relevant to so many lives. The show celebrates being different, like, actually different, where people point and stare and are rude. It celebrates putting yourself out there to defend the dignity and validity of your friends. This show really really gets it. :') 

This is like a masterclass in animation"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Enjoyed the crap out of this show. The characters,  the setting, the music, everything weirdly works. Has a real adventure time feel. 

One of these adventure shows that's been popping up under the radar like Hilda and Last Kids on Earth. Really hope we get more"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Cute show. I want the sound track!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I just watched the first season and I have to say I love it. From the post apocalyptic to have strange and abnormal creatures live like Avatar the last air bender(creatures part). Not to mention world design of all the strange and abnormal things, There is even character devolpement on all sides. The music fits it so well.  I think this is a very well thought out and executed story, that  I had the absolute joy to experience. I hope to continue to enjoy the story to see what happens. I feel there is a lot of depth to this story, but we will just have to wait and see."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"This show is amazing. I was just gonna watch the first couple of episodes to get a feel for it,
but I got hooked and ended up binging the whole thing in one sitting! The characters are great, the world it’s built is fascinating, the music and animation are top notch - really recommend it! 
Really hoping we get another season though, that  cliffhanger ending really left me wanting more."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Holy fuck that was hot.  HOT.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Just finished the season. Fantastic!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"In the third episode, Kipo contrasts deciduous trees with coniferous trees. Although most conifers are evergreen, not all of them are, and there are many evergreen trees that are not coniferous. Literally unwatchable."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"It was amazing ! I love the universe, the characters, the music ! There is that ""something I can't really describe"" that makes me love a show, a book or a game ! I'm 38 and happy to see animation getting better and better ! Thanks :)"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,What's the age range for this show?
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Really enjoyed this show. Too bad the sub doesn't have an episode discussion for each episode.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I went into this skeptical but ended up really enjoying it. Characters feel real, great themes, great animation, designs, world, concept. 

It feels like we're getting more quality animation lately. While it's a totally different kind of show I've also been loving ""Bless the Harts."""
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Up to episode 4 and it's pretty great so far
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Does anyone know the song from Twin Beaks, where the raccoons are running?"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"u/radkipo (I think this is how to tag you??)

**Mandu Plush!!**

I apologize if the formatting etc for this is a little off.  I literally just made a Reddit account so that I could say this haha!

I have probably watched through the show 6 times now.  I have watched it so many times that even my fiance knows the words to some episodes and he hasn't even been paying attention. XD  I've also been trying to convince all of my friends and family to watch it.

&#x200B;

I LOVE Mandu.  I was looking at the facebook page after watching through the show for the first time and saw that at one point in time there was a giveaway for a Mandu plush!! I unfortunately missed it and cannot find the plush for sale anywhere (eBay, Mercari, Amazon, etc.).  *Will the Mandu plush ever be for sale??? If there are no current plans will there ever be?*  

I need a herd of Mandu to eat cheesy snacks with me in my burrow. owo"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I love this series perhaps dreamworks best series so far!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Someone needs to create a subreddit so I can post my theories without spoiling things for anyone... please!!!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Oh snap, didn't realize this was already out! Will have to watch :)"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Thank you!!!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Just finished watching the show & will say it’s ok.  It’s on the low mid end of shows I’ve seen this year.

I don’t like it enough to recommend while also not disliking it enough to warn people off it.  5 out of 10."

Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Show creator here.  Really hope it picks up some buz in these next few weeks!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I felt like they were on a streak of good music choices, until the last battle with kipo. The music didn't fit the fight at all imo. The choice felt horrible other than that they did amazing with the music. Is it just me?"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I think that Netflix and other streaming servicea are the best thing to happen to animation in ages. Shows that wouldn't be greenlit for cable television now have a chance and now they can be way more creative.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,She also played Katana in Suicide Squad and the Female in The Boys.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"> nothing feels cliche

Actually, the show has a lot of cliches."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Looking forward to season 2 of Hilda and loving Kipo so far. I'll check out Last Kids on Earth.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,It's out!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Hmmm.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,She grew up in a cave.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I took that with a grain of salt because 200 years from now after civilization was destroyed. Why and how would they know everything? In the world I am so surprised the know as much as they did about the stars and galaxies. Unless it's a later plot point.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,5 to 65
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I don't know the actual rating, but based watching it, 12+ish? Hopefully someone with a better answer will come along.

I quite enjoyed it, either way!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,[TV-Y7-FV](http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/TV_Parental_Guidelines_Brochure.pdf)
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,like if kids are old enough for adventure time they're old enough for this.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I was wanting that one too. Shazam wasn’t working.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,It might be on the soundtrack which was released
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"So glad you love the show and are spreading the word.  As of now, there is no plan, but hopefully we get enough people interested in the show to make some merchandise"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Does Dreamworks have any other good shows? Seems like most are just movie cash ins.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,r/KipoAndTheAgeOfWB
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Dude I never watch animated shows on Netflix but this was next-level. You've added a lot to this genre. Thanks for making an enjoyable show.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I have a friend who is sort of notorious for being into all the new hip cartoons, and this came as a strong recommendation.  SO I invited 3 friends over and we watched the first 8 episodes until they had to go, and I watched the last 2.  This show is instantly one of my favorites.  I'm not that old, I started cartoons with Dexter's Lab really, and this was spectacular.  I'd put it up there with Samurai Jack, Infinity Train, She-Ra (your studio-mate?), and honestly if we get more story it could compete with Teen Titans and Avatar.

It made my eyes get watery both from the plot points in the later half, and because of just how special this show is and how I'm so happy it exists.  Black characters!  Gay characters!  EVERYTHING going on with Wolf!  Humming Bombers!  Joan Jett!  Jamock!  The dreams!  The subversion in the last episode!  The music.  I need more than the ost, I want it all, the score too.

I'm trying to get my friends to watch, and I plan on rewatching it in a month or two.  I'm trying to sell it as ""Hip-hop Spirited Away with late 2000's to 2010's Cartoon Network sensibilities"", which should get everyone on board.  Congratulations."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"You're a creator? Well congratulations, the show is phenomenal, and I don't say that lightly. IF it somehow doesn't pick up a lot of traction, I don't doubt that it will eventually become a cult classic. It would be criminal if a show like this went virtually unwatched. If it gives you any solace, I've already convinced four of my friends to watch it, and ALL of them are completely hooked! I feel like with better advertising, this show would have been a huge hit off the bat.  


I tend to be picky about what shows I consider my ""favorites"", and this show may have just become one of my favorites. I've even considered getting a tattoo based off of this show already!  


Thanks again for the fantastic adventure that this show provides!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Well this show is fucking amazing! Thanks for sharing your vision. My son (4) and my daughter (9) and myself love it. And that’s super rare. Big fans here.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Hi, I just wanted to thank you for making this show! I've always been a fan of fantasy and animated shows so of course I was going to watch this one as well.

But oh my lord, I did not expect to fall so in love with the world and the characters that you've created. I just kept pressing play at the end of each episode, I couldn't stop myself.
 The last time that happened to me was with Adventure Time, and I can only hope Kipo gets the same recognition."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Can I ask, as someone completely not in the industry \*at all\* (though well paid, my job is infinitely more boring, trust me). How do you go about creating a show like this from concept to finish? Do you come up with an idea, ""wireframe"" it (or whatever the correct word is) and then find a sponsor to advance money to develop it? The whole intersection between the creative process and the business of developing a show is so opaque to me. You seem really interactive on Reddit, and while I'm a nobody to ask for an AMA, I'd kill to get a bit of insight (ELI5 if necessary) into this.

My 6 and 8 year old daughters are blown away by the show, by the way! It feels like what Adventure Time would be if it was more coherent and more intelligent. The only other show we three all were equally pulled in by was Del Toro's Trollhunters."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I could tell from the trailer that this was somebody's singular vision. I'm so glad I looked up the comic. It's such a beautiful thing to see someone's creation brought to life. My wife and I are bingeing, two episodes left now, and we love everything about Kipo. 

I'm so happy for you, it's a magnificent achievement. Like.. it is sublime. Thank you 😊"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Just finished your show, it was phenomenal! Looking forward to Season 2!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Just gotta say binged the last few episodes today and freaking loved it especially the animations with the action scene’s like WOW this is some next level stuff  I was just in awe the whole time and I love the characters
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Thanks for the show! We just binged it as a family (daughter is 5)  over the last 2 days and all of us were into it.   
  
I haven’t been this into an Netflix animated series since Voltron ended. The world building was incredible and Kipo herself is amazing."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,I just started watching it with my daughter last night and we're hooked!!  It's amazing!!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"This show is the best on Netflix for this genre!! Awesome story, amazing music, cliffhanger on point! #season2"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"You did an amazing job, and the show deserves to be seen by tons of people, so hopefully lots of people end up watching. Are you allowed to say whether the initial order was for only the 10 episodes already out, or if it was for more episodes? Some Netflix shows seem to work like that."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"What's the name of the white cat!? I'm trying to look up the name of the voice actor but I can't figure who it is. 

Also I really enjoyed it. The music especially was super catchy and fun."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Late to the party on this thread, I'm on episode 4. I am not a music person but I'd straight up buy this soundtrack. It's a banger. I am gunna push this show on all my friends cause it's amazing thus far."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Put this show on for my nephew and I got into watching it more then I thought I would felt like a kid again watching Saturday morning cartoons I’ve watched the series 4 or five times already. Love this show hope it keeps gaining buzz. Great job keep it coming hope Netflix realizes the rare gem they have here.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Damn dude that snake in Episode 4(?) just made me burst out laughing. Like every line of hers was straight fire
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Your show is great, We just watched the first two episodes. Me and my SO talked about the good vibes it gave us, my SO said the show had that Miyazaki sense of adventure. Thanks for making it!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"I can only hope, the story is incredibly refreshing and the characters are very lovable. Awesome work and I can’t wait to see if there’s more!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Just finished the series with my 8 year old daughter. She is extremely upset about the cliffhanger ending and no news on a 2md season yet. Lol. As a dad, over the years I've found so much delight in adventure shows with strong girl characters, even more so when they are the lead. Thank you for this show!"
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Hey this series was a wonderful experience. I'll be honest with you, I binge-watched this back-to-back and it made my week. Thank you.

My girlfriend sucked me into the series by pointing out the EDM bees on episode 1."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Really enjoying it! Thank you!
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,Your show is AMAZING! I put it on for my kid but I got hooked myself.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Ever since I first watched Over the Garden Wall four years ago, I’ve been looking for an animated series that could blow me away in a similar man. 

This show is EXACTLY what I’ve been searching for. The creativity, the humor, the style, the MUSIC... all of it is absolutely perfect."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,They put way too much rap music imo.
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Lol, the female."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Honestly that's true!  But cliches can be well done, and they are well done here."
Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts,"Yep, the show is full of clichés and tropes, but instead of beating a few tropes overvtge head over and over again, it's more like they are all thrown in the show intentionally to be celebrated. Girl power, celebrate diversity, learn acceptance, kid hero, body changes, simple evil villains, power of kindness, it's like every lame cartoon trope from the late 80s/early 90s threw a huge celebration and became self aware.

I loved it."
Smile at the Runway,"“In a drama, I’m not the person with a knife, I’m the person getting chased. In a comedy, I’m not the person farting, I’m the person who smelled it.” 

This is so great. He's just so self-aware about his role and he plays it perfectly."
Smile at the Runway,"Damn, wasn’t aware that there was such a strong opposition to Bateman. I’ve always enjoyed his comedy work, and absolutely love the podcast he’s doing with Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. His dry humor has always hit for me."
Smile at the Runway,I didn’t know he and will are sober and in aa. That’s dope. I’m def gonna listen to that
Smile at the Runway,"For me, Bateman being in something, immediately tells me I should at least give it a go. It may not always be a groundbreaking film but it’ll be decent anyway"
Smile at the Runway,"No mention of “It’s Your Move,” one of the greatest comedy series ever?"
Smile at the Runway,[removed]
Smile at the Runway,Easy to forget sometimes that everyone on reddit is perfect and one potential situation of handling something badly is worth hate-brigading every single post about him for the remainder of time.
Smile at the Runway,"Only just hearing now that Ozark’s next season will be its final and have to say, I’m pretty glad about it. More than any other series I felt like this one stole the mantle from Breaking Bad of having an everyman way in over his head against dangerous people. If you go too long on a show like this, the tension just melts away too much."
Smile at the Runway,"This is a terribly written article that was solely created for clicks. That makes [two Guardian articles in one week, keep the ball rolling guys!](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/the-dallas-mavericks-are-consistently-white-in-a-black-league-why)"
Smile at the Runway,Regardless of his personal behavior I still love Bateman in Ozark.
Smile at the Runway,"Dude as a server there’s been some rough days and I’ve been off with tables for sure and absolutely came off as a dick and my shitty tip reflected thatS I’m sure if I got famous there would be a good amount of people over the last 15 years that would be commenting saying I’m a dick. However there’d wouldn’t be all the people saying how nice I can be too because that doesn’t get the blood pumping like talking shit. So calling a human being an asshole because they were mean to your mom and then everyone using that as evidence that someone’s an evil person is just fucked. Find me someone who never has bad days and unfortunately takes it out on their fellow humans now an then. Have some empathy, man no ones perfect. Even Betty white called a couple people a cunt now and then I’m sure."
Smile at the Runway,✨Don’t look up to actors✨
Smile at the Runway,Author writes Damp Down.  “Bateman tried to damp down the situation.”  Isn’t it Tamp Down?  [link](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tamp)
Smile at the Runway,"Try as he might, the whole Jessica Walter incident soured my opinion of him completely."
Smile at the Runway,Arrested development AND Ozark both fire. Marty f*ing Byrd and Michael Bluuth forever.
Smile at the Runway,Horrible bosses. Hilarious.
Smile at the Runway,This title is misleading and makes it sound like Jason Bateman was trashing AD
Smile at the Runway,Their podcast interview with George Clooney was great. Love Smartless
Smile at the Runway,It’s a damn shame he felt this way. Jason Bateman has always been one of my favorite actors ever since I saw Arrested Development when it originally aired on TV. His performance in the movie Bad Words is just pure gold in my opinion. I watch that movie at least once a year. Even his performance in Extract was great.
Smile at the Runway,Ozark is amazing!
Smile at the Runway,Holding strong on Tambor despite Walter being dead and everything we now know about Tambor is an interesting choice. Also weird he didn't offer any kind of words about Walter when she came up.
Smile at the Runway,Oh Michael.
Smile at the Runway,He's one of the most bitingly sarcastic actors out there. I love him.
Smile at the Runway,"I’ve always thought he was a great actor. He’s hilarious when he wants to be but he has range when he wants to play darker movies/shows like The Kingdom, State of Play, The Outsider, The Gift, or Ozark."
Smile at the Runway,There’s always money in the banana stand!
Smile at the Runway,I felt that It’s Your Move was the show that put him on the map. Show didn’t last long but all the kids loved him.
Smile at the Runway,"Anyone who likes Jason Bateman should watch The Gift.

Very well written, creepy movie, where he plays somewhat against type"
Smile at the Runway,"He’s brilliant at most things he does. And i like that he brings a relatability to his characters than just “actors acting”. 

However, i wish i could get into Arrested Development. I love straight-faced humor but couldn’t get into this show despite a few tries -meh"
Smile at the Runway,"What's most interesting is how it seems like if David Fincher doesn't take a risk to join Netflix to make Mindhunter then Arrested Development maybe never gets brought back to Netflix, and Bateman potentially never gets a chance to pitch Ozark. Totally just me reading between the theoretical lines, but that's how I read it."
Smile at the Runway,There's an alternate universe in which [Sam Seder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EcQrbMGXElo) plays Michael Bluth. Just sayin.
Smile at the Runway,"I think he might have little tolerance for stupidity...different than being an asshole. In fact, he seems one of the most grounded, intelligent actors in the pantheon. I wish the article would have touched a bit on his contribution to The Outsider. Remarkable show. The dude is just incredibly talented and everything he's in is better for it."
Smile at the Runway,All I know is that he is delightful to work with and I'd do it again.
Smile at the Runway,"I had such a crush on Jason Bateman starting on silver Spoons and going into “Its your move.”  Loved that show and really watched arrested from day one because of him. Still looks great, IMHO"
Smile at the Runway,"I love how incredibly human it is to recognize one's flaws and try to better themselves. Giving grace to yourself truly allows self growth. Will continue to admire is work and The Ozark is the best shows he's been on, in my opinion."
Smile at the Runway,PEOPLE DONT LIKE JASON BATEMAN????? MY GOD
Smile at the Runway,"I LOVED his movie Bad Words, and I've tried to get into Ozark before but was meh about it.  I think I'm gonna give it another shot.  Bateman is such a talented performer."
Smile at the Runway,"This explains it a bit. I’ve been confused for years because everyone I’ve ever known that worked with him said he was awful to work with, but he keeps getting cast and putting in excellent performances"
Smile at the Runway,"I was like a decade late to Arrested Development, if not more. Glad I tried it again recently though, it's hilarious."
Smile at the Runway,"He had some of the best lines in Dodgeball, loved his performance."
Smile at the Runway,What happened to his sister Justine?  She was pretty.
Smile at the Runway,I like him. I need to watch Ozark eventually
Smile at the Runway,"“Extract,” is one of my all time favorites."
Smile at the Runway,Lost all respect for this douche after that cast interview and he attacked Jessica Walter for speaking her truth
Smile at the Runway,"I’ve always been a fan of Jason Bateman. I always thought that if I were an actor it would be his sort of style I would use. 

A very good article."
Smile at the Runway,Jason Bateman is a god among men. KILLS it in Ozark.
Smile at the Runway,"TIL:  Jason Bateman is an asshole.

I had no idea.

The article opens with this bit about the beauty of being the director/lead actor.

It comes down to....

'My acting is never, ever, ever the problem and so much less time is wasted when there is a director (me) who understands this.'.

Wow."
Smile at the Runway,"An ex’s mom told me about how she used to work at the retirement home where Jason Bateman put his mother. Apparently he had very little time for his mom, was extremely rude to staff, and just a general asshole."
Smile at the Runway,"I watched the first season of Ozark, and while it's obviously a really well made show, it was just too dreadful for me to watch.  Maybe I'll pick it back up and give it another try sometime."
Smile at the Runway,Jason Bateman is one of our favorite actors (me and hubby).  Never heard anything negative about him.  Weird.
Smile at the Runway,"Life can and does punish us for remaining at the party too long.  Bateman has the talent to eventually, as a sober person, crawl back into the lights.  The latest season release has only 7 episodes vs the usual 10.... but the notation, something like ""part 1"" likely means they will eventually complete the remaining 3 episodes.  I think that Ozark has enough potential to make another few seasons of quality work."
Smile at the Runway,I love Jason Bateman. Game Night is an awesome film if anyone's not seen it.
Smile at the Runway,I had no idea he was the star in Teen Wolf Too. lmao time is crazy.
Smile at the Runway,What a fantastically written article about one of my all time favorite ‘straight man’ actors
Smile at the Runway,I want to see a reboot of The Naked Gun with Jason Bateman as Frank Drebin.
Smile at the Runway,"I love you Jason, be my everyman!"
Smile at the Runway,"He should be in the MCU, who I don’t know, but I think he should"
Smile at the Runway,Ozark stayed at the party too long …
Smile at the Runway,TIL JB has a daughter named Maple Bateman lol
Smile at the Runway,Boy. That reads bad re: Arrested Development. I love Ozark but it kinda sounds like the other shoe might eventually drop on something really terrible that happened on the set of AD
Smile at the Runway,So
Smile at the Runway,He just always came across as extremely douchey. I didn't know he actually was.
Smile at the Runway,"That article uses ""sumptuosness"" and ""propulsive"" within the first couple paragraphs. 

This is why I don't read about television."
Smile at the Runway,"ugh god another crying story about druggies? jeez this keeps up imma do myself the favor of ODing just to spare me from the bitchin from bunch of squares.   they dont even look like skeletons to have "" had a problem"". no cuts, no missing limbs.  sadly, this is when artists turn trash, when they have no recreational assistance.  no more pep in their step."
Smile at the Runway,"Ozark is great, but Arrested Development was pretty bad."
Smile at the Runway,I thought it said Bateman got arrested. And the title made me think “he must’ve messed up drunk” lmao
Smile at the Runway,"Thanks for posting, saw a flash of the article on the news. Wanted to read it, it did not disappoint. And confession time, I've never seen Arrested Development. Wanted to just never got round to it. I've even got season one physical boxset."
Smile at the Runway,One of my favorite actors of all time. Ozark is the best
Smile at the Runway,Coming back to read this.
Smile at the Runway,"I don't think so. I have always loved his work. Hell,  I'm just showing my wife arrested development and it's hysterical this time 'round for me. Hilarious stuff."
Smile at the Runway,Such a good article!
Smile at the Runway,what’s the rap on him?
Smile at the Runway,The real question is Ozark an Arrested Development sequel or prequel?
Smile at the Runway,Huh
Smile at the Runway,"It’s not the greatest movie but him and Ryan Reynolds in The Change-Up still makes me laugh out loud. No matter how many times I’ve seen it. 

“So I can’t sleep with my wife. I can’t sleep with other women. What the hell is that???”

“Marriage.”"
Smile at the Runway,I loved him on arrested and Develpment and on that show it was his mommy that was so amazing lol!!!
Smile at the Runway,“Okay.”  :)
Smile at the Runway,The Outsider was really good too. Starred in it and directed I think.
Smile at the Runway,Recently spotted him in later seasons of Little House on the Prairie
Smile at the Runway,Michael…………..
Smile at the Runway,Its your move
Smile at the Runway,There’s always money in the banana stand.
Smile at the Runway,Can he and Jessica Walter trade places?
Smile at the Runway,Seems like a truly good and self aware guy. Got turned on to Smartless and really dig it. A pleasant change from the typical vapid Hollywood type.
Smile at the Runway,He was considered a bully when he was younger
Smile at the Runway,Just what Boris Johnson keeps thinking...
Smile at the Runway,"I read this as ""Ozark is ~~about to come~~ back on."""
Smile at the Runway,every girl thinks he’s so hot.   it’s hilarious
Smile at the Runway,Who else absolutely hates wendy byrd lol?
Smile at the Runway,He’s a jerk just even listen to what he says about fans
Smile at the Runway,"I would say that in Ozark, he is both the person with the knife, and the one being chased, and gets to be the one who smells the fart, but also was the one who cut it.  

In fact, the ""smelled the fart that I made"", plot line is one of the most common devices used in Ozark."
Smile at the Runway,"I love the fact that he has line deliveries in Ozarks (to completely serious lines) that could play just as well in a comedy. You change the intro lines, the tone of the music, etc and it goes from being heavy to hilarious."
Smile at the Runway,He's literally the straight man in every role. I would think that's because he's pretty damn good at it.
Smile at the Runway,"His minor part in Dodgeball doesn’t really fit his normal mold. He just says really goofy, off-the-wall lines. Definitely more of the “farter”."
Smile at the Runway,"He's great at both, but I actually think he's funniest when he's ""farting"", like his small but hilarious role in The Sweetest Thing where he cracks jokes and insults the whole time."
Smile at the Runway,In dodgeball he def would have been the dude who farted LOL
Smile at the Runway,I don't know My philosophy is he who smelt it dealt it
Smile at the Runway,Bateman has been in show business longer than most people on Reddit have been alive; frankly it’s a miracle his career has lasted this long.
Smile at the Runway,He was definitely farting in best in show
Smile at the Runway,"[""...I make my living playing sort of man-boy.""](https://youtu.be/qqxMaQytIXU?t=3m52s)"
Smile at the Runway,"Ironic for someone named ""Bateman"""
The Healing Powers of Dude,Ciaràn Hinds is brilliant.
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Ciaran Hinds dies in everything I've seen him in, so I don't expect his character here to have a high chance of survival."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Mance Rayder!
The Healing Powers of Dude,Is Rory Kinnear gonna give birth to himself from his Rory Kinussy like in Men cuz if so i need to binge s1 fast.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Can they add an interesting story?
The Healing Powers of Dude,actors i've heard of? in the highest budget show ever made? CRAZY
The Healing Powers of Dude,"The first season was so boring and in many cases kind of stupid. Why was the dark lord on a life raft, he just coincidently met up with Galadriel? She just jumped off a ship and decided to swim across the ocean? The elf and the dwarf spent the entire season discussing what good friends they are. The volcano erupted, covered everyone in burning ash but everyone is okay. The army from Nimonea or wherever just happened to show up at a little village at the exact moment necessary with no pretext or reason. It was just stupid moment after stupid moment staring wooden 1 dimensional characters.

I wanted to like it, particularly with all the back lash regarding black elves, but man was it boring and dumb.

I wanted to add a bit of stupidity. The part time black smith enthusiast (turned out to be the lord of darkness or whatever) giving black smithing advice to the greatest black smith of all time, who has been doing it for thousands of years, and the black smith taking the advice, and being like ‘oh yeah, never thought of that’, wtf."
The Healing Powers of Dude,What role is George Constanza gonna be playing??
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Biggest letdown I've ever seen on television. Every single scene and dialogue seems so fake and cringe. Unbelievable they didn't just copy paste the style from the movies, and they could have done pretty much anything story-wise. But when everything looks like plastic it has a long way."
The Healing Powers of Dude,"I am a die-hard LotR fan, and I have read most of Tolkien's extended works, including the Silmarillion and The History of Middle-Earth. Love the films as well.


I thought Rings of Power was barely watchable. Terrible pacing, forgettable characters, and a wandering story that wasn't interesting in the least. The cinematography was gorgeous, and I liked the cast, but wow was the entire series a complete letdown for me.


I know that there is some conflict around the rights to Tolkien's original story, which I think is why the RoP went ""off-book."""
The Healing Powers of Dude,"The show lost me when they went from boat, to full gallop, to battle, to victory all in the span of timecode that was no longer than 10 minutes.  I felt abused by a show I thought was pretty great up until then.  I'm not even sure they CAN win back my viewership when they set up an entire story/season which is working up to something then blow straight through it."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Haven't seen Rory in anything since his fateful Black Mirror episode. 🐷
The Healing Powers of Dude,"they should ditch the showrunners as they did with picard season 3, but I don't think the show is redeemable"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"bets are open about which one of those will play an asshole character, and which will play a good, strong, empowered and determined one"
The Healing Powers of Dude,Black Mirror ruined Rory Kinnear for me.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Mance!
The Healing Powers of Dude,Why is everyone suddenly spelling Ciar**á**n Hinds's name with the fada the wrong way around
The Healing Powers of Dude,This fan fiction will never be cannon in my eyes. This show was born out of Jeff Bezos lust for money and fame and the writers have an obvious hatred towards Tolkien’s vision. Fuck this show.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Is anyone even looking forward this mess of a show anymore?
The Healing Powers of Dude,Can they add some new writers?
The Healing Powers of Dude,Nah I’m done with this show. No way I come back for season 2
The Healing Powers of Dude,"""You killed a Consul of Mordor!"" - Ciaran, probably"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"I found the first season pretty unwatchable, got about halfway through before bailing.  It was too hard to suspend disbelief and I found many of the characters uninspiring; the mediocre writing as well left a lot to be desired.   
To those that stuck with it...best of luck with Season 2!"
The Healing Powers of Dude,How wasn't this cancelled
The Healing Powers of Dude,Just cancel it already
The Healing Powers of Dude,*Worst fucking deal I’ve ever made.*
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Maybe they'll be cast as Doromir and Agathirn in a party of harfoots and the wizard Brindorf to destroy a magical item in ~~The Southlands~~ Mordor.

Jesus Christ this show was a disappointment all throughout but especially at the end of Season 1. Capped by those cringeworthy fan service lines from The Stranger. What a complete and total waste of effort and resources."
The Healing Powers of Dude,how'd this trash get a second session?
The Healing Powers of Dude,I’m most curious how long Amazon is going to persist with this farce to save face.
The Healing Powers of Dude,The bald man is so handsome I fell in love with him when he appeared in penny dreadful.
The Healing Powers of Dude,i really hope tanya moody's buds call her 'madeye' or it's all a waste
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Whoa, I don't know Rory Kinnear, but I love his dad in all the Beatles movies"
The Healing Powers of Dude,Did they add new writers
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Nice, now replace the showrunners."
The Healing Powers of Dude,That show is dead.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Not even Ciaran Hinds will be able to save this show from itself.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Good actors but no thank you.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Sooo is aragorn a black woman now
The Healing Powers of Dude,I'm still not going to watch it.  Season 1 was a bitter disappointment.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Has anyone prepared Tanya for the “black”-lash to come? At this point it’s like predicting the weather…
The Healing Powers of Dude,"It doesn't matter how many great actors they throw at this huge, stinking turd, it's still gonna be a huge, stinking turd!"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Have they got new show runners and/or writers?

If not it doesn't matter how good actors/actresses they get, you can only polish a turd so much."
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Not interested at all. The first season wasn't good. The only thing I liked was the practical makeup/prosthetics for the orcs.

Everything else was just bland high fantasy garbage."
The Healing Powers of Dude,"I will at least try season two but my hopes are low, the show is not horrible but it's definitely not good, it barely scratches mediocre for me. Some of the casting, the pacing, the writing, all of it could've been done so much better but I have my doubts these showrunners have the ability to pull it around, we'll see."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Bruh who is still funding this dumpster fire?
The Healing Powers of Dude,I was so excited and also very hesitant to watch this lotr adaptation. I got through an episode and a half before realizing it really doesn’t exist in the lotr universe and was more for like little kids. Really disappointed hopefully PJ comes back one day
The Healing Powers of Dude,Whattttttt?  Mance Rayder is joining LOTR?
The Healing Powers of Dude,Rory Kinnear should appear in more shows/movies
The Healing Powers of Dude,We're still getting a season 2 after the crap that season 1 was? ok then.
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Why was Sauron on a raft? Was he waiting for Galadriel?  Was it a happy accident? Where was he going? His entire backstory and all of his motivations are blown to bits the second that his identity is revealed so what were his motivations for the first 90% of the season? Was he just baiting Galadriel? Why was he on a raft?? WHY WAS HE OUT THERE? Was he leaving??? Did he somehow know she jumped out of a boat and he just set up the entire thing to run into her??

Also, why are the heroes being duplicitous? This is a universe where they (in the show!) establish that there is objective morality and the ends do not justify the means under any circumstance but everyone is acting like they're Game of Thrones characters trying to trick each other and hide their true motives even when it doesn't really serve them or their goals. The actions of the heroes are indistinguishable from the villains. Is the message that even in a binary ""good and evil"" world, there's not actually any good?

Why was he in the middle of the ocean??? What was he doing out there? Why did he go there? Why does he allow himself to be put in jail? Was that intentional? Why was his plan so dependent on other people acting in a very specific way? Can he predict the future? Can he bend them to his will already? If so, why the theatrics and convoluted series of events? WHY IS HE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?? It's almost like the show runners are dumb people who perceive ""smart"" as being complicated with a bunch of steps because they don't see anything else because they can't abstract the motivations of smart people because it's so foreign to them so they just thing it's them plotting out seemingly random things like they can predict the future. Surely that's not the case because there's no way this would be handed off to complete morons right?

Is the simple answer, ""~~because the writers are dumb~~?""

It can't be that! They paid a billion dollars. Why was he out there? Why are the elves dumb? Why are there old elves? Why the fuck are the elves so ugly? Why do they trudge through the snow?? They don't leave tracks in the snow. Why are they sinking into it??? Why is everyone not bowing to/falling in love with Galadriel? Why are the other elves not terrified of her? Why do none of them call her ""aunt"" or ""cousin""? Where is her husband? Did they make her single because they wanted a romantic temptation with the living personification of evil? Is she dumb because she's horny? That seems sexist. Can they not write a woman character without having some of her actions informed by temptation so they made her single? Are they that shallow? Do they think that little of their audience?

WHY IS HE ON A RAFT IN THE OCEAN FOR NO REASON AND WHY DOES ANYTHING ELSE HE DOES MAKE SENSE? WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ALL OF THAT?"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Amazon employees are having a field day by commenting positively about this dumpster fire I see.

Its a ok serie when you don't compare it to the movies."
The Healing Powers of Dude,"This will have what to do with Tolkien, again?"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Rory Kinnear is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. If you want a masterclass in acting, watch Penny Dreadful."
The Healing Powers of Dude,I'm torn between never wanting to see or hear about RoP again and keep watching just to poke fun of it.
The Healing Powers of Dude,"I find the hate this show gets really weird.

Ciaràn and Rory are great additions though. I haven't really seen anything Tanya Moodie has done"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"This show isn't as terrible as I thought it would be, definitely delivered far short of it's potential with some daft writing but it also had some genuinely good elements to it (Elrond and Durin were the strong point for me, they were fun to watch and I loved the atmosphere)

There were too many plots going at the one time and the show would constantly take the foot off the accelator when one plot started getting interesting and cut to another plot to spend 20 mins watching less interesting characters deliver dull monologues.  Constantly killing momentum at the exact moment something is about to happen, made the episodes feel like they were padding them out and were afraid to stay with a climatic moment for too long.

I'll give season two a chance, there's just enough there for me to come back to, but if they repeat the same mistakes then I'll probably bail at that point."
The Healing Powers of Dude,But why? Did they already pay for the second season or something? Nobody's gonna suffer through another one.
The Healing Powers of Dude,That guy in the middle looks like the host of hot ones
The Healing Powers of Dude,Are they hiring better writers?
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Another steaming pile of money, I have zero faith in this."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Long haired elves or GTFO
The Healing Powers of Dude,"I dug this show.  Sorry, my comment is not a pithy negging one-liner."
The Healing Powers of Dude,so they didn't cancel season 2. why?
The Healing Powers of Dude,Yea I’d be cautious attaching my name to that pos.
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Rory Kinear will never be the same for me after watching Men. If you've seen it, you know why."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Rory Kinnear was so bloody great in *Penny Dreadful* that the fact he didn’t win an Emmy (or Eva Green) just shows be how worthless award shows are.
The Healing Powers of Dude,From the thumbnail it looked like Colin Robinson. Was curious the direction they’d be going with energy vampires.
The Healing Powers of Dude,I think it’s the law that every old times HBO show wit swords and horses has to have hinds in it.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Did they add any new writers
The Healing Powers of Dude,Great stuff!!
The Healing Powers of Dude,So the flop continues....
The Healing Powers of Dude,That's nice. Now what will they do to add viewers?
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Can't have someone in that show doing a half decent Irish accent, so Ciaran can't be a harfoot anywho"
The Healing Powers of Dude,Is the Show good?
The Healing Powers of Dude,Mance effing Rayder
The Healing Powers of Dude,"More majestic horse rides, please."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Wait. How is there a season 2 after the massive train wreck that season 1 was?
The Healing Powers of Dude,Siiiiigh
The Healing Powers of Dude,"It doesn't matter what they do going forward, after 5 episodes, I couldn't take it anymore."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Who cares about this dogwater show. It doesn't deserve the name LOTR
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Cool. I won’t watch this season, either."
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Great show, despite what the smoothbrains on reddit think. The visuals and costumes were amazing."
The Healing Powers of Dude,"They could add the entire cast of the original movies and I still wouldn't watch this hot garbage. They ruined it before it even got off the ground with those Tolkien-hating show runners and writers who thought they could actually one-up Tolkien with his own world building and characterizations. Galadriel as presented as the heroic female lead of this crap is not just a pale shadow of what is represented in the books, she's a complete bastardization of her. As to the rest...just crap after crap after crap. I definitely won't be coming around for season 2. When it comes to adapting fantasy ""franchises"" such as this and Wheel of Time, Amazon has no clue what they are doing and neither do the show runners they hire."
The Healing Powers of Dude,Who cares? Travesty they are going to make another season.
The Healing Powers of Dude,"More diversity castings, whata surprise… just make a portion set in the damn east if you want dark people in lotr, theyre not in the west… the blue wizards could be spotlighted aswell"
The Healing Powers of Dude,I think I’m the only one on Reddit that genuinely enjoyed the show.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Maybe the story will be better
The Healing Powers of Dude,"If they want to throw millions away and see it come back, hire whoever made *the Last Of Us*, they have a good story and a good cast"
The Healing Powers of Dude,"Well it wasnt exactly better actors this show neede.. Oh well it did, but it needed better writers first and foremost !"
The Healing Powers of Dude,Still going to be mid though…
The Healing Powers of Dude,Apparently they can't stop until they ruin the next big cultural mythical franchise. I already feel sorry that such a great actor as Ciaran will waste his energy on that guaranteed train wreck.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Have they hired new writers yet?
The Healing Powers of Dude,How the fuck did this even get cleared for a season 2?? I want to say 95% of the people that watched this show hated it and ripped on it. I guess they decided to go with the other 5% without a brain and said fuck yeah! tHeY wAnT mOrE
The Healing Powers of Dude,How about hiring some writers who aren't complete morons?
The Healing Powers of Dude,But will it not be shit? Maybe actually hire show runners that know what they are doing.
The Healing Powers of Dude,I for one am looking forward to the YouTube reviews of this guaranteed flaming dogshit. They were a great source of entertainment to me.
The Healing Powers of Dude,Won't change the writing.
The Healing Powers of Dude,this show sucks ass they're getting wasted
The Healing Powers of Dude,Man they should stop spending so much money on good actors that will anyone need to work with boring and bad writing and hire better showrunners. You had a diamond and provided a plastic pebble.
The Healing Powers of Dude,I am soo looking for to season 2.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I really hope he gave himself the full rehearsal experience and we get to see it as a special or part of the 2nd season
Somali and the Forest Spirit,This is almost as crazy as the time I crashed my Scion TC at a 100 mph!
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"""But the more I practiced the line about the bean salad, the more I began to wonder: what I was trying to accomplish here? If I won, which version of me would they be giving an award to? Which version did they want to see? Nathan Fielder, the comedian? Or the persona I'd created for this production?"""
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"If the practise for this speech appears in season 2, I swear to God, I'm going to go completely insane."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Door city over here
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Can’t believe he didn’t comment on how heavy the award is. 
Would love to see the flow chart of this acceptance speech…. Dependent on: Get a laugh / no laugh"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Is it an actual prize? , or did Nathan stage a phoney awards ceremony and present himself with another trophy?"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,We better get an episode in Season 2 that documents his rehearsal process for getting the award
Somali and the Forest Spirit,remember a video of Nathan and apparently there are no videos of him out of character and its great to see him still either being completely himself or being someone entirely different.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Is it just me or does he look a lot older in this video
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Find a job where you can do exactly what you'd be doing if you weren't working and you'll never work a day in your life, even if you were working."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Fuck he’s a funny guy
Somali and the Forest Spirit,😂 that show is cray
Somali and the Forest Spirit,How can it be unscripted? Didn’t he have writers help him with his rehearsals?
Somali and the Forest Spirit,The show is scripted though.  He scripts all of his actions and meticulously picks out the best scenario for him.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Isn't the Rehersal by definition scripted? Literally, the point of the show is that they rehearse and script/ predict out every single interaction and story beat."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Non-scripted? The show seemed totally scripted to me. Loved it but i find it hard to believe it wasn’t scripted.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Damn how big is The Rehearsal’s budget this season that they got Audra McDonald
Somali and the Forest Spirit,That sounds exactly like the sort of thing he’d do
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"He never breaks character on camera. That's part of his whole thing. He's definitely playing the role of rehearsal Nathan here, I think this is a bit for the show. Being confident and having jokes land due to the amount of in depth practising and over analysing, while also at the same time still being in the awkward ""Nathan for you""character mode, is quite the acting achievement."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Mark this post or something because I have a serious prediction: whatever is happening in season 2, we’ve already seen part of it, first that strange cameo at the baseball game awhile back, and now this."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I called this many moons ago: that he’d win an Emmy or something and it would all be part of season 2. Can any redditors with skills find my comment? I’m thirsty for recognition
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"When I was binging Nathan for You for the first time, I stumbled across an appearance he did on Jimmy Kimmel. The interview was hilarious, but I was slightly offput by some of the weird comments. I was absolutely shocked to see literally the next episode I watched was about orchestrating that specific interview."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,It’s days like these I curse the Germans for inventing automobiles
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Your comment is 32 minutes old. Makes me think of Psalm 32. Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I'm happy to see our man saying things once more and going places.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"""It wasn't until after the show had concluded that I was told there was no bean salad. So to make my speech a hundred percent authentic, I reorganized the event, inviting all the same guests. Only this time, I hired this professional chef to prepare ninety pounds of bean salad and place the bowls on tables in highly foot trafficked places around the auditorium. This way, nobody in attendance would be able to recall which version had bean salad and which didn't."""
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Load up on those anti-psychotics friend, it’s looking and sounding like that’s exactly what this is 😂"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"I was looking at the people on stage with Nathan but in the background, trying to decide if they were actors or not"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Considering it would be trivial to just go film such a scene next week, that shouldn't be very mind blowing.  It's how a lot of his stunts work."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Trish the dish!
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Lmaooo
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Bean salad got a laugh
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Yeah I'm starting to question whether the entire award show was faked for a season 2 episode of the show
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Dumb Starbucks
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"There are some pictures of him from either high school or college and they are hilarious.  They take place at a party and he's in the background reading a book, lol."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,There is only one time (I think) where he breaks character and believe it or not it’s on his show. It’s when the gas station attendant promotes his grandson’s pee. The man himself confirmed it on his AMA.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"His youtube is up and has tons of stuff like student films he did back before he was famous. Videos from 16 years ago obviously filmed on a DV tape recorder lol.

https://youtube.com/@nathanfielder"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,It was the SuperEyepatchWolf video I’d guess
Somali and the Forest Spirit,He definitely is at least a couple hours older than last time I saw him
Somali and the Forest Spirit,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcJcsKaWAAEJijA?format=jpg&name=900x900
Somali and the Forest Spirit,You’re probably looking at one of his aging mirrors
Somali and the Forest Spirit,The rehearsal was shot in early Covid so if you’ve e been watching that then he’s gone from mid to late thirties
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"He’s greying pretty quickly the last couple years and doesn’t seem interested in dying it - good for him, I think it looks good"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Guy has worked a TON recently. I mean he does it all. He creates the show, writes it, stars in it, everything. That has to be insanely demanding. Not surprised he is aging."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Check back tomorrow, he should look younger by then"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,SharePoint administrator!
Somali and the Forest Spirit,It's unscripted because their was no script.  Unscripted doesn't mean they can't get any help.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Improv comedy counts as unscripted
Somali and the Forest Spirit,He has a lot of good flow charts for how conversations *might* go.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"The entire Angela storyline was reactionary. Unless the entire thing was completely staged, there's no way they storyboarded the whole season out before filming."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,This series was heavily staged and a fair bit of scripting
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Like the Kimmel story set up episode of Nathan For You.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"I'm not aware of the baseball game, I'll have to look for that"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,The baseball game was just him having a fun day out with his coworkers.  He was spotted with Emma Stone and Benny Safdie who are working with Nathan Fielder on his new show The Curse.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Just wanted to make an online stranger smile. So here it is, you called it.

https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/wtnqbt/_/il7fkil/?context=1"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"He better win an Emmy at some point, should already have at least one for Nathan for you."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,you said 32 twice when divided by two is 16 which is 8+8.  88 new beginnings
Somali and the Forest Spirit,No pulp
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I'm starting to question whether the entire show was faked so he could win this award
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I think he breaks character during his argument with Angela.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Also during the ghost realtor episode when she starts talking about her succubus experience, and he’s just flabbergasted"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I was laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes the first time I saw that.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"There are a couple of other times as well. When he's driving that super drunk dude home from the antique store episode, and then he and his brother start talking about how they double team girls together, there's a very brief shot of Nathan breaking into a smile as they keep going on about it. I'd also say he broke in the ghost realtor episode, but that one is a toss up."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"He just looks at the dude like ""what did I just hear?""

one of the all time great TV moments."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"There’s actually another time too. In one of his very very old youtube videos it goes something along the lines of him making a meta joke about the kind of person who would be watching his stupid video, then he stares at the camera for a while. It’s got to be one of the only times I’ve ever heard of him breaking the 4th wall for the “character” he has created."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Could be any little kids pee. No older than 5
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Is improv if he practices?
Somali and the Forest Spirit,How was it not staged?
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"If the premise is that they rehearse every single possible interaction beforehand, then that's scripted. Just because once or twice an episode, one of the real people does something that causes them to divert their path (where they rehearse what happens next anyways), that does not make the whole thing unscripted. They have an overarching direction for the show. 

For example, pro wrestling is entirely scripted. However, there are times in the moment where somebody messes up a move, someone gets injured, they forget a line in a promo, or the crowd is not giving them the reaction they want, so they improvise on the spot. That doesn't make the whole show unscripted. They just had to improvise to take back on track.

You would never call pro wrestling unscripted, despite the fact that any moment plans could change because of any number of factors getting in the way. 

It's the same with the Rehersal. They had a goal, they had obstacles, they reacted, and adapted the story. That's scripted with improvisation."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Here’s the first article I found on it. I guess it was a little longer back than I thought. My perception of time has been off. 

[https://decider.com/2022/10/08/nathan-fielder-embodied-every-mets-fan-during-last-nights-game/amp/](https://decider.com/2022/10/08/nathan-fielder-embodied-every-mets-fan-during-last-nights-game/amp/)"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"That’s certainly possible, but it is also possible they were shooting something for The Curse there. The Safdies shoot rogue all the time for their movies, wouldn’t be surprised if they were getting some sort of coverage at the game for the show."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,You’re a saint!
Somali and the Forest Spirit,You responded with 12 words. When added to 88 new beginnings I get 100 which is exactly how fast I was driving when I crashed my Scion TC.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,I’m beginning to wonder if Nathan Fielder has staged the entirety of the universe
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"I agree, once or twice he seems to show true exasperation with her comments lol."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"In The Rehearsal, there’s a bunch of times where it looks like he might be breaking character with Angela. He spent a ton of time with her compared to other schemes he developed, and you can see in the later episodes he’s somewhat legitimately fighting with her about some of her insane views and opinions, even if he also knows it is great material for the show."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"He definitely breaks with the ""Jesus, Bill"" during the Finding Frances episode as well."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Shout out to that J squad!
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Bruh 🤯
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Believe me all improv comics practice. I went to an improv performance and none of the things they asked of the crowd actually changed anything. 

What I mean is they had a sketch pre written and then asked for vague things like a location and then just went through a sketch of two parents having an argument in front of their child at the zoo. The location didn't matter at all except the ""kid"" saying look at the monkeys like twice."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Her reactions were genuine.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"I feel like your argument is moot. The awards aren't worried about the actual dictionary definition. They have a category and decided shows like that best fit in there because of their unscripted/improv elements. They aren't claiming that none of it is planned or written in advance, its just the category that perhaps best fits the show. Don't overthink it"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"This would be more like if they pulled random people from the crowd on stage with the pro wrestlers. So the pros are still good at what they do, so they can still improvise with amateurs and do some moves. They prepare themselves as well as the can, but at the end of the day, they don't know how it's going to go.

""The Rehearsal"" was born out of their process for ""Nathan for You."" They did a similar flow chart to help themselves predict what the randos would do so they could react well and make it funny, or make it work.  But they found that their predictions were almost always completely wrong, and the unexpected contributions of these unique people became some of the most valuable parts of the show. Finding Frances was basically like ""Well, this guy is interesting. Let's hang our with him and see what happens."""
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"You’re confusing the “rehearsed events” of the show with the actual show itself

To give a better comparison - it is like making a documentary about a stage play. Every piece of the play in the documentary would be scripted, but the documentary itself is not. 

We watch Nathan make scripts and change them in the show - and while things are meta those actions in the moment weren’t scripted in advance. We’re watching an unscripted show about someone attempting to script their life. 

The wrestling comparison doesn’t work because “scripted” in visual media and “scripted” in casual use aren’t the same thing. When people talk about wrestling being “scripted” (I usually hear the term “staged” which I think eliminates some of the confusion) they are generally making a comparison to other sports and the notion they are completely live and unpredictable. The context changes what the term means.

The Regearsal had scripts for portions of what they were documenting, it had storyboards and planning, but ultimately it’s still more like a documentary than it is what’s considered “scripted television.”"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,[removed]
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"“The pressure of trying to live up to the first season of my hit TV show “The Rehearsal” was starting to get to me, so I thought I’d try and escape for a few hours by being an anonymous spectator at a professional baseball sporting event…”"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"He was at the LA Kings game a few nights ago as well. They showed him not only on the jumbotron, but on the broadcast feed as well. I remember thinking ""Huh. Nathan does *not* seem like your average hockey fan, but cool."" I mean, he is Canadian, so maybe it's a genetic trait."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"True.  But I guess my point was I don’t think they were shooting anything for The Rehearsal.  Yes, maybe The Curse."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"While that may be true of a lot of them, it's definitely not the case for all improv. Take Middleditch and Schwartz for example. The crowd participation at the start has a major influence on the sketch. I'm sure they still practice, but not by planning a scene."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"I am not over thinking it, I am just trying to have a discussion about whether it's actually scripted or not. Nothing serious. Happy they won something. It's s a great show and it doesn't get enough love for how creative it was."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"> We watch Nathan make scripts and change them in the show - and while things are meta those actions in the moment weren’t scripted in advance. 

Sorry, but no.

That was scripted.  Fielder has been making this kind of content for years.  He films and presents it to look authentic, but it isn't.

It's no different than when a magician says he's reading your mind and can tell what card you had.  It only works on those who want to believe."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Yeah I took a bunch of improv classes to get more comfortable Public speaking and we performed really small shows.

We definitely would practice certain games but the scene very much was not scripted. We'd end up in weird places almost every time"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"You're right, good improv is practiced not planned.

Bad improv however......."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"It’s planned and structured but it isn’t scripted to the seventh degree - there was absolutely no way to script what was happening at the end of the season, and part of the whole point is that no matter how much effort he put into attempting to script everything he couldn’t get himself or others to fully predict everything and stick to a script

You’re missing the entire point of the show haha - and missing the difference between “scripted” and “highly planned”

Edit - and there’s tons of evidence of Nathan for you showing things go off the wheels and quite obviously many of the guests not being scripted or told what’s going on at all. You’re confusing nathan’s character for the whole content being fake, which again misses his entire underlying theme

Edit - really, respond and block me immediately?"
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"You originally referenced a different specific staged screen and then, embarrassingly, revealed that you didn't even realize it was staged.  Now you're referencing an entirely different scene.

You're the one that's missing... a lot.  But you're the perfect mark for that kind of conceit. 

You're the kind of person who thinks a hero pig saved a drowning goat, because you saw it with your own eyes, and there's no way tv would ever trick you, and all narrators must be reliable.  It also sounds like you don't understand terms like ""scripted"" or ""planned"" or ""staged"".  

> it isn't scripted to the seventh degree

And you're lecturing people about writing?  Bone apple tea."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Agree completely. Her performance was wonderful. 

Mossbacher got a second shot with Andor."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,Literally every actor in that show should be getting some award. Show was incredibly well done all around.
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Heard, chef."
Somali and the Forest Spirit,"Naija in the building!!! So happy for her, I haven't finished the Bear yet, but she's been great in everything I've seen."
ID:INVADED,"If you like that sort of series opening, you should check out at least the first episode of ID: Invaded.  The main character wakes up in a mysterious dimension with no more context than the viewer has.  Without spoiling too much of the mystery of the first episode, I think I can mention that it's a sci-fi crime series, sort of similar to Psycho-Pass."
ID:INVADED,I mean we can pretend Dracula existing in the first place didn't make it clear magic existed I guess but I don't buy it. The point was them killing someone who had never done them wrong and the existence of plenty of benevolent magic users helps prove it is possible
ID:INVADED,"I'm not trying to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure you accidentally said Syhpa instead of Lisa at the end of the post."
ID:INVADED,"> we're led to believe that the Catholic Church actually had some form of divine power.

That they can perform a task that makes water anathema to vampires does not necessarily mean it's divine in origin as a phenomenon. Given what that world is like, it probably isn't.

You're really mistaking the forest for the trees here. Magic in that world materially exists, even if it's beyond present understanding doesn't mean it somehow stops working. That's not how the laws of nature are. Gravity still works whether you believe in it or not.

There is not a dissonance between there being magic and monsters, and human religion being full of shit.  "
ID:INVADED,">That they weren't an institution based entirely on superstition and lies, and they may have been correct to murder Lisa after all. 

I don't know where you got that idea from. That priest is never shown to be anything but a petty, power-hungry asshole. "
ID:INVADED,"I don't think science and magic in the world of Castlevania are mutually exclusive. Lisa is a scientist, all of her acts are performed through science, and she's adamant about that fact. Sypha is a wizard, her actions are magic, and that's fine too. It's not fine that the church killed Lisa for being a scientist, however. The two can and should exist together in that world, but the church is bent on keeping it's populace ignorant and dependent on it. Presumably, the church is afraid that if the general population learns to embrace science, they'll eventually reach a point wherein they no longer have need of the church. "
ID:INVADED,"Falling Skies have the same premise. Instead of other countries invading U.S., it's aliens.

I suggest watching it. It's not a bad show."
Dorohedoro,Great show. Hope people give It a shot
Dorohedoro,"Huh, was gonna watch it on an app but guess I’ll wait for it on Netflix. I like bigger screen better."
Dorohedoro,It's pretty faithful to the manga too.
Dorohedoro,"This show is wild, was hooked from the first 10 seconds of the trailer. Really hope they make more."
Dorohedoro,"Great, looking forward to watching this."
Dorohedoro,"Hopefully they get more time, budget and texture artists"
Dorohedoro,"Now if they can stop with the shitty CGI I’ll watch it

Edit: I grew up watching cowboy bebop, akira, and trigun. I’m a bit biased."
Dorohedoro,dorohedoro s2 pls!
Dorohedoro,Now make a proper BERSERK please
Dorohedoro,Buy Claymore rights plz
Dorohedoro,"More Castlevania and final space plz. FS isnt classic anime but wow, its incredibly good."
Dorohedoro,Netflix animes look weird to me. I can't seem to finish a season of any of them.
Dorohedoro,"Id wish they just struck the deals with some famous writers and do animated adaptations of their series. I mean, Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive or Erikson's Malazan are perfect materials for animated tv series. It would be way cheaper than live action and allow for better storytelling than 2hour movies."
Dorohedoro,KENGAN ASHURA S3 AHHHH PLEASE
Dorohedoro,"I'm too late and no one's gonna see this, but guys, the majority of the anime you're listing isn't made by Netflix. They label them ""Netflix Original"" because they have the sole translation and streaming rights. Knights of Sidonia, Seven Deadly Sins, Dorohedoro, Beastars, Kengan Ashura, none of it is made by Netflix. They don't fund them either.

Meaning asking netflix to continue any anime is useless."
Dorohedoro,It would be great if we get  love death  robot  Part  2
Dorohedoro,"More Love, Death and Robots. That was a massively creative series that was just fantastic."
Dorohedoro,">Upcoming in 2021 and beyond are Spriggan (David Production), Vampire In The Garden, (WIT STUDIO – a group company under Production I.G), and Super Crooks (Bones)."
Dorohedoro,More baki
Dorohedoro,More Baki and Kengan
Dorohedoro,Berserk please. A true adaptation.
Dorohedoro,"Please don't be 3d animation, please don't be 3d animation, PLEASE don't be 3d animation"
Dorohedoro,[removed]
Dorohedoro,"I watched devil man cry baby and kakegurui on netflix and was blown away by both. I'm down with some more anime.

Seven deadly sins seems to be more popular than either of those shows though, which I find odd since it's a fairly standard escalating power levels shonen type anime."
Dorohedoro,No shitty 3D animation please. Go back to 2D anime like Castlevania and/or Violet Evergarden. Shit like Berserk is disappointing when hampered by shitty block-looking animation bullshit
Dorohedoro,"Looking at the list they've contracted,

MAPPA are the people behind God of Highschool & Jujutsu Kaisen - these 2 recent shows have had amazing animation. Fluid fights and just downright amazing angle control. They're also in charge of the final AOT season, so Mappa is definitely great.

As for the 2021 list, Bones (My Hero Academia) and WIT Studio (Attack on Titan s1,2,3 and The Great Pretender) are also high quality studios.

Netflix has great studios under their contract. It's up to them to give enough time, space and money in order to succeed."
Dorohedoro,Hope that means they continue making Knights of Sidonia!
Dorohedoro,"Great, so they can make 2 seasons then abandon them all on cliffhanger endings? Hard pass on Netflix OC until they commit to actually following through."
Dorohedoro,Great Pretender slapped
Dorohedoro,Can't wait to see what Science SARU do next.
Dorohedoro,Been waiting for season 2 of Attack on Titan for 5yrs
Dorohedoro,"More *Ajin,* please.

But also, I applaud this fervently. I grew up between old-school My Little Pony and Toonami. There’s not much I enjoy on TV besides unreality and animated stuff tends to be right up my alley. I’ll resub if this goes through for sure."
Dorohedoro,"They already have so much Anime stuff. I started watching some crazy show about a guy who's head was turned into a Crocodile head.. the world is full of sorcerers and he has to put their heads in his mouth so the man in his mouth can tell Crocodile man if that was the sorcerer who turned his head into a crocodile... On the 5th episode now and I have no idea what the hell is going on, completely lost track of the plot after around 15 minutes. Its beautiful animated though

&#x200B;

Edit: Also I realise everyone hates the 3 part godzilla Anime, but I freaking loved it. It was amazing, especially episode 2"
Dorohedoro,"Scrap the live-action, hire the original creators, and make more Avatar!"
Dorohedoro,"Was just thinking yesterday about [Eden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i8Ds2nVVXE) and the fact that it's still not out, wonder what happened to it..."
Dorohedoro,"Anime content: good

Anime live action: hell no"
Dorohedoro,All I want is another season of Love Death + Robots
Dorohedoro,Needs more JoJo
Dorohedoro,"I haven't seen anyone mention The Promised Neverland.  I'm not huge into anime, I just kind of fell into this series, but I was completely hooked!"
Dorohedoro,Would be cool if they took over for new seasons of OPM. The manga looks so good and deserves the same attention to detail on the anime.
Dorohedoro,"I just wish they would stop with the 3d style bullshit. Im sure some people like it but I think it just looks terrible. Its a shame cause I'm sure a lot of the shows have good content but the 3d style dosent do it fo me. I know a lot of my friends feel the same way about it too.

I suppose it could be the studios and not Netflix themselves doing it, but idk"
Dorohedoro,"Cool. Not my thing, but nice for those who like it."
Dorohedoro,More trash for the trash gods!
Dorohedoro,Yawn
Dorohedoro,"I’m always saying what a lack of anime there is...
/s"
Dorohedoro,Castlevania season 4
Dorohedoro,"More ""Love, Death and Robots"" type shows.  I love the thematic ties of multiple animations styles, a lot."
Dorohedoro,Finish 7 Deadly Sins and Castlevania pls.
Dorohedoro,please... no more 3d animation...
Dorohedoro,"This is the cycle repeating itself again and helping usher in new fans the same way old fans were made.

how many of us old guard anime fans found out abut anime by switching channels and landing on something called dragonball z,sailor moon,pokemon etc?

And how many new ones are going to be made by looking for something  to stream and stumbling across something that starts the love affair.  


The old stuff had SO many issues also yet i will always have a soft spot in my heart for the horribly censored dragonball z.  The flaws didnt stop me it just made me want to find something better."
Dorohedoro,"Now, if only they'd only realize that deciding to release the shows episodically in Japan vs all-at-once in the rest of the world leads to more piracy, things would be better.

Seriously, Everyone else realized that a majority of anime fans want to watch the content as soon as it's available to be watched and started simulcasting anime as it aired in Japan as a means to fight piracy.  Deciding to withhold the content in select markets is a huge step backwards and only fuels piracy.  It's just proof that Netflix does not understand what the anime community wants, and only garners stronger distaste towards them with every studio they sign exclusivity deals with.

Imagine hearing about an amazing new anime coming next week that has you pumping with excitement.  The first episode airs in Japan, nothing appears on Netflix.  The next episode airs, still nothing on  Netflix.  By the third episode, you are tired of waiting and find an illegal stream elsewhere to watch it.  It's frustrating that Netflix doesn't understand that what they're doing hurts their image in the anime community."
Dorohedoro,Netflix please stop I can’t handle another butchered anime you’ve already done too many shows the dirty
Dorohedoro,Netflix have identified its weak among the weabo demographic
Dorohedoro,Bro just give me more altered carbon resleeved movies.
Dorohedoro,"Just let me filter it out by default please. No problem with people wanting to watch what they want, I just want control over what is suggested to me."
Dorohedoro,"Just make a full series about some of the better anime shorts on “Love Death + Robots.” 

First episode about the bioengineered, human piloted monster arenas got me hooked and I need more. “Sonnie’s Revenge” was the name of that short, for anyone curious.

Not to say there weren’t other really good shorts, each one had its own little world that could be fleshed out, I just love the adult cyberpunk pokemon world."
Dorohedoro,I'm still waiting for their Pacific Rim anime and Blade Runner: Black Lotus. It's been years since any significant update.
Dorohedoro,Still waiting on my S3 of Kengan Ashura!!
Dorohedoro,That Godzilla anime series was awesome
Dorohedoro,"They need to team up with crunchyroll and get in on that action. I'm talking Dr. Stone, Re:Zero, My Hero Academia. All sorts of good stuff."
Dorohedoro,Don’t be shy stop doing CGI and animate Berserk
Dorohedoro,Now *please finish Knights of Sydonia*
Dorohedoro,"Oh great, more netflix stuff that will end on a cliffhanger and get cancelled, can't wait"
Dorohedoro,Finish spice and Wolf plz
Dorohedoro,I haven’t watched the last season of 7 deadly sins yet because I assume it doesn’t end yet and I’m not sure if they are continuing it.  Hopefully.
Dorohedoro,"More hand-drawn and less CG, please."
Dorohedoro,What animes are actually good in netflix?
Dorohedoro,"Well considering manga made over 3 billion in digital and physical copy sales, compared to comics which made 1.85 billion in sales. I'd say its a safe bet."
Dorohedoro,Still no hentai sadly.
Dorohedoro,Please for the love of twinkies NO MORE 3D ANIME!
Dorohedoro,"If they can find more shows on the level of Great Pretender, if be down. The final arc might have been a train wreck, but the production was on point."
Dorohedoro,I hate the CGI bullshit they make. Awful
Dorohedoro,"If it’s with that TERRIBLE shitty CGI, hard pass!"
Dorohedoro,No more of this ugly 3D shit
Dorohedoro,Onepiece needs more love in the west
Dorohedoro,"Hot take, 3D anime isn’t worth watching."
Dorohedoro,"I am happier when Netflix works directly with producers instead of weird licensing where you have no idea what their plans are long term. That said, how Netflix approaches anime and Japan are very different. As before, I sadly expect very little to change but I hope at least one decent property comes of it."
Dorohedoro,Just... no more 3D please
Dorohedoro,Just buy Crunchyroll
Dorohedoro,Always nice to add more kids content.
Dorohedoro,Looks like I'm cancelling Netflix then.  /r/animewasamistake
Dorohedoro,The Great Pretender needs another season - here's hoping!
Dorohedoro,Or how bout just get shows we already like like how Netflix was supposed to be...
Dorohedoro,"I thought Anime was drawn, not the 3d 15fps garbage the put out."
Dorohedoro,[deleted]
Dorohedoro,Some real hand-drawn anime would be nice
Dorohedoro,"I just wish they stopped with the 2 fps action scenes. 
Not even Castlevania was safe from them."
Dorohedoro,"I haven’t watched much recently, but I really loved that my favorite old school 90s and 2000s anime were one off series that told a complete self contained story within 25 episodes, sometimes 50 if it was two seasons. They should take advantage of the Netflix model of short running series and just tell complete stories rather than drag storylines and then inevitably cancel them before they’re finished."
Dorohedoro,Can they just add Shippuden please
Dorohedoro,What happened to the Castlevania team tackling Devil may cry?
Dorohedoro,Don’t fuck it up like you did Berserk
Dorohedoro,Solo leveling please please please
Dorohedoro,Netflix needs to quit fucking around and pick up The Venture Brothers.
Dorohedoro,"Are they still doing the witcher anime?

Also, would love a Warcraft anime, one which each season explores a different time periodd"
Dorohedoro,"Fix Kengan Ashura, you cowards! Invest in better animation than that awful CG that makes it near unwatchable!"
Dorohedoro,"Oh God, more garbage animation? I know they're trying to get content, but they shouldn't forsake quality.  I've stopped watching Netflix produced/ogc anime because I feel like I'm watching some 20fps slideshow and it hurts."
Dorohedoro,"Fuckin weak, I hate anime."
Dorohedoro,Anyone else find the animation style in a lot of netflix animes to be just......weird?
Dorohedoro,"Man, I really liked Ajin DemiHuman and Knights of Sidonia. I can’t be the only one...."
Dorohedoro,More Castlevanias and Great Pretenders and fewer Dragon Dogmas please.
Medical Police,"Awesome, I hope Netflix can get the streaming rights to Childrens Hospital too!

The cast according to Netflix (though from the trailer it seems like most of them are going to have smaller cameos):

* Erinn Hayes
* Rob Huebel
* Malin Akerman
* Rob Corddry
* Lake Bell
* Sarayu Blue
* Ken Marino
* Fred Melamed
* Tom Wright
* Jason Schwartzman
* Eric Nenninger
* Megan Le
* Beth Dover
* Zandy Hartig
* Brian Huskey
* Michael Cera

Only really missing Winkler and Mullally, but maybe there's still hope for a surprise cameo."
Medical Police,"Hopefully, this will lead to revival of NTSF:SD:SUV::"
Medical Police,I wish there was a place to watch all the Children's Hospital episodes.
Medical Police,"Finally!  Childrens Hospital is one of the best shows that barely anybody has seen.  The fastest dumbest smartest comedy, I fucking love it.  Hopefully this does well on netflix!"
Medical Police,Is it really so crazy that I faked my own death because I had too many e-mails?
Medical Police,"Righteous! 

Children’s is the best and I can’t wait for this. Looks absolutely insane"
Medical Police,"Malin Akerman is a real comedic gem. She can handle dramatic roles, too, but she's so freaking funny. I was bummed that Trophy Wife bit the dust so quickly.

EDIT: Also, for anyone who likes horror movies, please watch The Final Girls. She's great in it, and it's a creative send-up of the slasher genre."
Medical Police,I love smart stupid humor. I can't wait to watch this.
Medical Police,"God I loved children’s hospital

“Are you gay, are you blind??”

“DO NOT CALL ME BLIND”"
Medical Police,Oh hell yes. I've been dying for more Childrens Hospital and this is basically just a concept season of that? Gimme
Medical Police,"I love this group of comedians. The same comedians circle NTSF:SD:SUV, Burning Love, Wet Hot American Summer and Children's Hosptial"
Medical Police,Children's Hospital is one of my favorite shows ever.  I can't wait for this
Medical Police,"Wow, this looks so good that I'm going to binge re-watch Childrens Hospital right now...."
Medical Police,I really hope they continue the show within a show concept of Childrens Hospital
Medical Police,"Children's Hospital is one of the all-time great comedies, criminally underrated.   

   

Night shift is my favorite episode."
Medical Police,Netflix finally with the quality product
Medical Police,Okay now this is exciting news.
Medical Police,This is unexpected and amazing.
Medical Police,[deleted]
Medical Police,Fuck Star Wars. I want Medical Police.
Medical Police,That looks stupid as hell. Im in!
Medical Police,"I really can't tell if this looks great or absolutely horrible.  

I know for sure it's not in between"
Medical Police,Hot damn I'm excited for this.
Medical Police,Only 2/3 of the way to Doctor Cop Lawyer
Medical Police,I'm excited for this. I liked Children's Hospital and Angie Tribeca. So silly they are funny.
Medical Police,"""From the Team"" means [They're remaking Children's Hospital with the same cast](https://youtu.be/KARVE5Ep3xU)? I am so down!"
Medical Police,I love children's hospital but I didn't laugh a single time during this trailer :(
Medical Police,Being a cop and a doctor clearly makes you a cocter.
Medical Police,"Oh shit, I have to make sure I have an ample amount of marijuana when this debuts."
Medical Police,Hopefully it turns out better than the [several other spin offs](https://youtu.be/t-U-SBQeWzM)
Medical Police,"YES PLEASE! 

Loved children’s hospital.

This needs to have a cameo from Dr Lucien Sanchez... STAT


https://youtu.be/Ee6qxFaGmtM"
Medical Police,[deleted]
Medical Police,"I liked Children’s Hospital but based on this trailer, I’d rather have another season of Angie Tribeca."
Medical Police,"Man I wanted to laugh at this, but it’s just soooo dumb"
Medical Police,There is not a lot of medical drama parodies. The last one I saw was Jay's Anatomy from Nick Cannon's Short Circuit.
Medical Police,It's the school nurse from New Girl!
Medical Police,Did they find a cure for cancer?
Medical Police,So Annabel Porter stopped being a lifestyle guru and quit Bloosh.
Medical Police,fuuuuuuck i completely forgot about children’s hospital I need to rewatch that
Medical Police,"Hey Netflix, “Cop Doctors” is a *way* better name."
Medical Police,Are they still based in Brazil?
Medical Police,Is that Blue Falcon?!
Medical Police,I had that comb as a kid. Neat as fuck.
Medical Police,"Love the trailer, hope the show is good!"
Medical Police,"If you love Wet Hot American Summer, and haven’t seen Children’s Hospital, you’re missing out on so much good tv."
Medical Police,Yes please!!!
Medical Police,"[One of the many reasons I’m excited for Erinn Hayes to have her own comedy series.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vBkBS4O3yvY)  She was also great in the criminally under-appreciated comedy *It’s a Disaster*, which is a film well worth checking out."
Medical Police,[deleted]
Medical Police,Ok that ending made me laugh
Medical Police,but where will DETECTIVE CHANCE BRIGGS be?
Medical Police,Is no one gonna comment that Nickelodeon's Doug came up with this idea?
Medical Police,"I've never heard of Childrens Hospital (no apostrophe, OP) but since everyone in this thread seems to be head over heels for it, I'll give this a chance.

But, frankly, this trailer makes the puns and their delivery sound kind of lame... It's weird because it stars a lot of comedy actors I like."
Medical Police,As a Brit.....I don't get it? They seem to be trying too hard  :(
Medical Police,That look like a series I will be tired of really fast - the constant irony upon irony...
Medical Police,"Is anyone else not bugged by the constant misspelling of Childrens Hospital in the post title and in these comments??

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!"
Medical Police,This feels like a high-budget show posted to Youtube.
Medical Police,"Just can't get into these shows, it's all so on the nose. There's zero subtly to the jokes.

When every character is a moron it's just...meh."
Medical Police,So how is this funny? Is this an American thing?
Medical Police,That John Cena?
Medical Police,I hope Bob Dukka makes a cameo
Medical Police,Is that Fredo on the stretcher at the beginning?
Medical Police,"3, 2, 1..."
Medical Police,"Anyone else getting Neil Breen vibes from Rob Huebel? Absolutely nothing against him, I just wanna know if anyone else got that."
Medical Police,"Is this a spinoff, or could I watch this having never seen Children's Hospital?"
Medical Police,I’m not a clown anymore! I’m a doctor!
Medical Police,[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkN8WtFTpE)
Medical Police,"Looks greeat, haven't seen children's hospital but I'll watch this."
Medical Police,My wife is going to love this.
Medical Police,I am very impressed by how American she would despite having to learn her lines phonetically
Medical Police,"See you later Alligator. 

:| .... ur an alligator"
Medical Police,Is there a clown?
Medical Police,thats the dude from “human giant”? i will watch
Medical Police,So this is basically if ntsvsdsuv had a kid with children's hospital....
Medical Police,That guy in the thumbnail is like John Cena mixed with Mark Wahlberg. Who is he?
Medical Police,"Haven't watched the trailer yet, but Rob Heubel's in it so it's probably hilarious."
Medical Police,F#%@ yes!!!
Medical Police,"So someone somewhere thought you know what? why don't we just take Scrubs and Brooklyn nine-nine, 2 of the best sitcoms of all time and put them into a fucking blender. Has to work right?"
Medical Police,RemindMe! 1 Day
Medical Police,I’m down for it
Medical Police,That looks dumb as fuck
Medical Police,Anyone else think the guy at 0:49 looks like Sugar Ray Leonard?
Medical Police,"I like the lead actor, I remember him for his hosting job on MILF Island in 30 Rock. He’s hilarious lol. I can’t wait to see this."
Medical Police,"Garth Marenghi's Darkplace meets Scrubs?

Because you should totally watch Garth Marenghi's Darkplace."
Medical Police,"Great cast, but fuck is it hard to find Rob Huebel funny, personally."
Medical Police,Great to see the trailer
Medical Police,Reminds me of my personal favorite Angie Tribeca. Tribeca! Get the hell in here!
Medical Police,"You may laugh, but this is basically this:

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical\_Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Investigation)"
Medical Police,This is supposed to be funny?
Medical Police,.
Medical Police,"Netflix has a lack of comedy Originals that's up my alley (Futurama, 30 Rock), this should help."
Medical Police,"This is being made by Warner.

HBO Max is coming soon to compete with Netflix.

This show is pretty much doomed unless the contract allows it to move to HBO Max. I hope I'm wrong and Netflix won't cancel this after 1 or 2 seasons, I love Childrens Hospital."
Medical Police,Fuck Kevin James.
Medical Police,"People are worn out from cop shows and medical shows? LET'S COMBINE THE TWO.

&#x200B;

Netflix has been making some really dumb decisions lately."
Medical Police,I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a few cameos.
Medical Police,"Ken Marino? Sold, day one watch."
Medical Police,They had me at “from the makers of Children’s Hospital”. They had me again at the trailer. Now they’ve had me a third time at Lake Bell.
Medical Police,"Sure we have Huebel, but I don’t know any of these other people.

Where’s Rory Spindell, Just Falcon, Dixie Peters, Ingrid Hagerstown and Lynn Williams?"
Medical Police,Also Craig Robinson! Can’t leave out the Pontiac Bandit.
Medical Police,I too want so badly for Children’s Hospital on Netflix now
Medical Police,"Huh, just the other day I was thinking of what Rob Corddry was up to these days."
Scissor Seven,Yeah likewise. turnsout theres already a season 2 being made hopefully it gets brought over to netflix also.
Scissor Seven,"Got a notification from Netflix about this show today so went into it blind. Next minute I finished the whole season. What a fantastic, funny and ridiculous show!! Weird thing was that the English subtitles didn't match the English audio. I couldn't find any info on the show anywhere, such as imdb. Anyone know why? I really wanted to know who the voice actors were."
Scissor Seven,[deleted]
Scissor Seven,[deleted]
Scissor Seven,"I think my neighbors were awakened by the sound of my outbursts of 2 AM laughter while binging this show last night. The creativity with the story telling, humor, action, and animation is top notch! Long live Scissor Seven!"
Scissor Seven,am I hearing cantonese mixed in with some mando or??
Scissor Seven,Sounds like Ronny chieng dubs the main character. His voice is very distinct.
Scissor Seven,"Season 2 surprised me, they filled in the blanks and added alot of depth while keeping the humor both present in the first season. Has me excited for a third season and it had no business doing that lol"
Scissor Seven,[deleted]
Scissor Seven,this show was excellent. It nailed the comedy and executed the shounen formula very well. and the chicken flashback was the best part imo
Scissor Seven,Watching it right now. Was googling around to see if Stephen Chow had anything to do with this - seems like his style of comedy.
Scissor Seven,I love the show action scenes are smooth. And the offbeat humor is great. I love how I can still get the anime shonen references even in english. What is better English or Mandarin I honestly love Ronny Cheng's voice and it's a pretty good English dub. Help.
Scissor Seven,"Watched this on a whim today. I saw it in a meme format. I just realized it's also in English and I switched and recognize voices and found this post.

it's goofy and I'm assuming there's some Chinese humour/wordplay I miss, I'd love to know more about this!"
Scissor Seven,At the end of episode 1 they ask an old lady if she'd like to come in for hair cleaning services. The duck then says they also offer special services and laughs. The old woman calls them scumbags. I think it's funny because hair washing is a euphemism for prostitution.
Scissor Seven,"So I started watching this when it first came out but got distracted with other shows so I never finished it. I recently picked it back up again and noticed that there’s bleeps now, was that always a thing? I feel like they swore a bunch in canto without it being censored. Is that just me?"
Scissor Seven,"This show is awesome, I found the second season online but it was Chinese only. Have to wait for Netflix or a fan sub :("
Scissor Seven,maybe I can try do  fan sub
Scissor Seven,"Yeah, good show, excellent dub if you ask me, I love the chinese songs. The animation is slick and satisfying, and it is very funny."
Scissor Seven,Its so good. Stumbled upon it. Watched the entire thing in one night. All 14 episodes
Scissor Seven,ya'll it on youtube
Scissor Seven,"Season 2 is out and can find sub online for it, more interested if anyone knows if it'll get a season 3. season 2 ended with so much hype!"
Scissor Seven,Are there epic fights like hxh one piece or berserk
Scissor Seven,"Is it just me or does the ""assassin"" version is seven speak canto? He speaks both mando and canto randomly lol 
*edit* yes confirmed via older comments"
Scissor Seven,Season 2 was out I think last week? Fewer episodes though but even better.. and of course the humor. I underestimated this anime the first time I watched it. I thought it was just some comedy anime. The story and fighting scenes really gets better in the second season
Scissor Seven,"Just finished it and I love it. I feel like watching another Whacky comedy like this with good art, any recommendations?"
Scissor Seven,"well, one if best manhua it has comedy story action. if you are rick and Morty fan you go enjoy this well it has one extra i.e story which isn't in rick and morty."
Scissor Seven,Just found this show a couple days ago and watched all 3 seasons already now I’m sad hope the wait for season 4 isn’t long 😂
Scissor Seven,"There is a season 2 in chinese check out killer seven. Can't find it with english subtitles though, hopefully netflix buys it"
Scissor Seven,"It's originally in Mandarin and a lot of the jokes don't translate well to English so for the English audio they probably rewrote some of the jokes, especially the ones were the characters slip in some Cantonese phrase or make references to some Chinese pop culture stuffs. The subtitles are probably made to be closer to what the Mandarin audio says."
Scissor Seven,"Yeah it is way off for some reason. Might be better to watch one or the other, but I think there is some stuff that can only be read with subs on. 

No idea why there is no information on it, but it somehow seems to all be related to the translation stuff. It won an award, I’m thinking Netflix liked it and wanted it show it even though it wasn’t originally intended to be broadcast like it is on Netflix."
Scissor Seven,same! just started watching today and i'm already addicted
Scissor Seven,"Yeah, the band that does the OST is dope. Unfortunately they're Taiwanese and expressed pro-HK sentiments, so the studio has [cut ties](https://www.reddit.com/r/Donghua/comments/dxmcjd/scissor_seven_discontinues_collaboration_with/) to ""resolutely protect the sovereignty of our country and completeness of land, rejecting all speech and actions that will split the homeland in any way or form""

I guess it's my own fault for enjoying something made in Xi's paradise"
Scissor Seven,[deleted]
Scissor Seven,"Yea, I heard that too in episode 10 all of a sudden. My Chinese and especially Cantonese suck, though, but I was suprised to hear it! I wish I knew more than a few basic words and phrases"
Scissor Seven,The trailer isn’t even on the Netflix YouTube channel. Maybe it has something to do with being Chinese-made.
Scissor Seven,From what I've found and given the fact that
Scissor Seven,"Yes, there's A LOT."
Scissor Seven,"Obvious suggestions but:
- One Punch Man
- Mob Pyscho 100 

Both have amazing animations and are funny"
Scissor Seven,"You guys can watch all season 2 with subs in this channel, here is the first episode https://youtu.be/Z53VeLU0RJk
Yeah they are in HD, so it should be more than enough lol, enjoy!"
Scissor Seven,"Yeah I guessed that, I ended up turning off subs and really enjoyed the jokes in the English version. Wish I knew Mandarin and could watch the original. Plus the music in the show was actually so good"
Scissor Seven,It's stuff like this that makes me miss fansubs when they would keep the saying/wordplay/jokes in and explain. I mean.. it's obviously hard to translate things. I just like learning stuff like that
Scissor Seven,I think you're right about the translation stuff. I have a feeling that the show was originally made in Mandarin. I went back to listen in English for one of the jokes and it was translated differently because the Chinese reference wouldn't make sense in English. The English sub is probably the translation from Mandarin and not for the English version? Just my guess
Scissor Seven,"Yeah some of the jokes rely on Canto mixed in with Mandarin, they changed a bunch of jokes to make it play better for a US audience in the dub"
Scissor Seven,"Damn, it got taken down. Do you have any other links?"
Scissor Seven,I always thought it was nifty when manga did that in the margins.
Scissor Seven,https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1ASu_XSQKyQhOnp31P2z_w60uIrtM-58j
Scissor Seven,Ty
Scissor Seven,"I was not expecting to love this as much as I did, I was mostly just looking fr something different. The worldbuilding in this is great."
Scissor Seven,I haven’t even heard of it. Any anime it reminds you of?
Scissor Seven,"It's Chinese, so pretty different but it has similarities to martial arts shounen with slice of life elements. It can get pretty cartoony sometimes."
Scissor Seven,Actually no to be honest but I'd recommend checking the first episodes out as there quite short.
Giri / Haji,"I loved this Giri/Haji.  The acting was superb, I loved the different cultural nods to both the UK and Japan, and the humour was phenomenal.  I was surprised when I dind't see people raving about this show.  And I agree regarding the 'particular scene'... I thought the scene was very touching, so well done, so heart-felt I couldn't understand the vitriol it received."
Giri / Haji,"I enjoyed it for the most part! I wasn't a fan of the cop and the relationship between her and the main detective. It felt forced. I think the writing could have been a bit better. The acting was great, especially the brother and the friend."
Giri / Haji,"I loved it.  It's great when there's something different to enjoy.  Even though I didn't like Cats, at least they tried, you know?  But this I think suceeded.  It was incredibly entertaining and the characters were really interesting. 

The only parts (SPOILERS) that really bothered me or seemed a bit odd were:

* Sarah really jumps on board with helping international gangsters all too easily.  She's a cop who turned her boyfriend in for planting evidence.  Yes, it was perhaps more out of revenge than duty, but still.  They didn't really provide any reason she'd just go ""Okay, I'll help you with crime.""
* And then there's the morality of the Mori family as a whole, particularly Yuto.  We're supposed to be rooting for them, I suppose.  But shit, they did/do everything wrong.  I think that's part of the purpose of the film, exploring these imperfect people.  It's just a bit upsetting to realize they all suck and the world would be better without any of them (except Rodney, perhaps).  
* Justin Long and Donna get killed and nobody seems to care.  His father was foreshadowed as a big Philly mobster on his way there, and Donna had some weird thing with Yuto that was never explained.  So they die and those plots just get forgotten.

But also major points for having Justin Long in this!"
Giri / Haji,"See, I don't think any of that stuff is a bad thing, at least through the more charitable lens I see them.

It's a soap opera, first of all, and I don't mean that pejoratively. It follows many characters, their relationships, their individual stories. Yes, *Giri / Haji* tries to flesh out the stories of a lot of characters, and I'm glad it does; it's why I love the genre as much as I do. This isn't just the story of a crime 2 people are trying to solve. It's the story of many people living through a crazy situation. It's really ""a show about misfits - broken people lost in a big city, trying to put themselves back together again,"" as writer Joe Barton put it.

About that crazy situation. Yes, it's wild, kinda blockbuster action movie-y ,and probably isn't treading on new ground here wrt to yakuza pop culture stories. But also, it's not really about that. That's used as a propulsive engine to attach the rest of the story to, the misfits-in-big-city stuff. It amps everything up, raises the stakes, and I think allows the show to go to some more extreme places stylistically.

And that aspect of the show wasn't afraid to take some big swings character-wise, which I liked, e.g. the thing with the drugs and the police and the car, and what that wrought, late in the season. Was that a wild turn? Sure, but it's one I bought well enough — crazy shit happens in real life — and I wanted to see how the characters reacted to it.

I take it you didn't like the dance sequence? I loved it. Stylistically this show was ambitious from the get-go, and this scene fit into that I think. Way too much TV these days looks the same, and is visually and stylistically unambitious as hell. *Giri / Haji* was going for stuff, and more than any other element that's why I liked it so much. Whether that be the animation inserts, the dance sequence, what would be a normal shot of 2 people having a conversation instead [heightened](https://i.imgur.com/TXJuATb.jpg) with rain and some bright colors, or even the way they jumped around the timeline a bit through a soap story, which mixed things up and felt new to me."
Giri / Haji,I absolutely loved it and captivated throughout the whole thing. Super underrated and not getting enough exposure
Giri / Haji,"What?! I’ve never heard of this, but I’m totally watching it tonight from your description. Sounds like a ridiculous dreamscape."
Giri / Haji,I don’t agree with OP’s critique at all. I thought it was brilliant and original. The dynamic between the two brothers showed real development and nuance. One of the best series around right now. I especially loved the interpretive dance scene at the end. Didn’t see that coming.
Giri / Haji,"It was a bit weird. But that’s expected with Japanese (and korean) shows. I was more impressed that BBC let japanese TV style into the show. 

In any case, it entertained me, which made it worth watching."
Giri / Haji,"The head of drama said, ""It's unlike anything you've ever seen before on British TV.""  He wasn't lying."
Giri / Haji,"I though it was  a great police drama. I thought it was a great family drama. For about 6 episodes then people started having the same conversation, for the 3rd time. I liked the little stylistic flourishes it had in the earlier episodes but that in no way set up *that* sequence. My main gripe is almost nothing is resolved and if everyone is having an existential inversion point then it seems monochromatic so the drama is nulled. I would still suggest it just for the novelty."
Giri / Haji,"Will Sharpe is amazing in everything he does.

It took me a bit to realize that Rodney was Shun from Flowers"
Giri / Haji,"It was a good show, but bonkers? That award would go to second season of You."
Giri / Haji,"I am five episodes in and it feels like a live-action anime.  Not that I watch anime, mind you.  From the way the OP says “that sequence”, I am looking forward to the inevitable cliffhanger setup for season 2 which is as customary for Netflix as the Rodney character."
Giri / Haji,By the same production company that made Chernobyl
Giri / Haji,"LOVE the show.  Binged-watch the entire show in one night (had trouble getting up for work in the morning, lol).  WORTHY!

Anna Sawai (plays Yutu’s girlfriend) is *fucking* HOT."
Giri / Haji,"I just finished it last night. Ya, wtf episode 8? There were times where I loved this show, actually laughing and feeling...feelings at how some scenes were played out. And then there were parts that simply left me at a loss as to how a sequence of events could lead to this specific destination. 

I will say that I do recommend the show regardless"
Giri / Haji,I hugely recommend this show.
Giri / Haji,"Just watched the trailer. Most definitely watching this one, looks great!"
Giri / Haji,"I was told this was gonna be a crime thriller, which it didn't turn out to be in the end (imo). Therefore I'm left with mixed taste."
Giri / Haji,First 2 eps were ok episodes 3 and 4 were amazing and 5 and 6 were boring as shit imo. Haven't seen 7 and 8 yet
Giri / Haji,"I'd have to agree, I thoroughly enjoyed it however, there are an outrageous number of plot points (many of these choices by the characters) that were completely unbelievable and served no logical purpose beyond driving the plot (at least in interesting directions).  Absolutely riddled with, ""wouldn't this be cool?"" ""Yes, let's do that"" style writing. eg the amount of time the characters spend just generally hanging out with each other when time is a factor and the stakes are so high."
Giri / Haji,That dance shit reminded me of the OA season 1 finale
Giri / Haji,I'm so glad you created this thread. I was going to watch two shows based on the weekly recommendations thread but I forgot both titles. One of those was definitely this one. thanks.
Giri / Haji,"just finished watching this and I think your review is pretty spot on.

I just kept on thinking to myself ""how the fuck are we wrapping all these crazy stories in 1 episode""

what a ride. lol. But yeh lucky comically ridiculous but also really good"
Giri / Haji,I think it started off well when everything was a mystery. It was interesting seeing a Japanese detective running around London looking for a yakuza hitman. It should've stayed that way for me personally because I didn't really like all the other characters backstories even though I watched them I just felt bored because of the mediocre writing. I think it should've just stayed almost taken style in the sense that hed be on his own getting into gunfights with the different gangs of London and close in on his brother alone through his own detective work.
Giri / Haji,Should I watch this show?
Giri / Haji,"I’ve just finished it now. I’ve never had such mixed feelings on a show before.
When it started I was really invested and liked the stylish stuff and the characters. Then around episode 6, it focused on Kenzo’s wife, the daughters romance, and suddenly more and more subplots are introduced. It seemed to lag a bit and motivations were a bit all over the place.
Then THAT scene happened; which in itself was nice to watch but completely out of place.

I also feel like all the plots were really lazily wrapped up? And like, even Rodney, who was the best part of the show, did he really need to be there? Like he never really contributed to the main plot line (aside from planting drugs on the copper). 

It was all very bizarre. Really confused. I did love the first 4 episodes though."
Giri / Haji,"I know I'm mad late, but I think the thing that was incredible about this show was how well it did with pulling all of those things together until the last 3 episodes, when it started to fall off the rails for me.

Seriously, the subplot with the gay club kid especially was great. The problem is they really didn't know what to do with a lot of those subplots so they got resolved in silly ways. The british gangster guy randomly deciding to help them at the end, the gay club kid spending the night at his mom's house ??? 

Definitely truly unlike anything I've seen on tv"
Giri / Haji,"I don't like it personally, perhaps because I am bias in that I know some Japanese, the Japanese parts were jarring. I couldn't see why they have to be Japanese. Perhaps it is an excuse for the crew to visit Japan? Other than that, I agree that it was creative and wild, not afraid of walking on uneven ground, even if it is ill-advised. I think the Britishness of its cinematography also adds to the experience, but at the same time, to me, the story just takes me out of the experience, making every viewing more of a chore because I couldn't care less what happen next, and just waiting for the next visual spectacle to happen, drinking in the atmosphere, kind of the opposite of a crime thriller, somehow, much closer to a noir, neo-noir or hard-boiled crime movie British version."
Giri / Haji,There's this dance scene that caught me so off guard. It just made me laugh my butt off
Giri / Haji,"The writing is good, but yes, it goes bonkers at times, and ""The sequence"" is EP08 is too much for, hummm, almost everybody.

I still do not know what to think about it, I think I would recommend it, after all, it is only 8 episodes...

Oh and Sex Tourist Roy is the best character..."
Giri / Haji,I haven't watched it yet and I'm Muslim. Why is it called haji?
Giri / Haji,"If you know it's a BBC production Netflix simply optioned for international broadcast because they outbid BritBox, why focus on the Netflix aspect in your thread title? 

Also, if you liked this you might want to watch McMafia."
Giri / Haji,"Really mixed. Really mixed. Yup. Lot's of ""Why is he going along with this?!"" moments that make no sense. And yet... you keep watching, because... it's interesting."
Giri / Haji,Starts off brilliant but goes stupid and boring as it goes on.
Giri / Haji,"I agree with you so much, I could barely get through it. My husband thought it was decent tv drama and I just thought it was laughably bad. The lack of chemistry between Kelly Macdonald and Kenzo. I thought all the actors were pretty bad except for Will Sharpe. And the car rolling over with a loose baby inside! What."
Giri / Haji,Sarah just wants the D.
Giri / Haji,"I shouldn't comment a more-than-two-weeks comment but oh well. 

I agree with several criticism made around about this series, but I don't get how people expected the Moris (or the cast as a whole) to be ""good people"". 
Hell, it's a drama about gangsters, people going with gangsters for their reasons and people part of a corrupted system that supports said gangsters. 
They aren't good people FROM THE START. 

If Kenzo was a good everyday policeman, would you really send him only because he knows the guy he is supposed to be looking for?
If Yuto was just a ""Guy that made bad choices"", would he murder people like that? 

It's a crime drama about criminals and people walking on a thin line who ends up falling from said line, sooner or later. 
The real criticism I would have is with Sarah. 
She really isn't given too much of an explanation about why she goes along with it, but as I have learned to do with years in fiction, I just tried to read between the lines and think for myself what the hell she could be thinking if she was a real person and not a character with a specific set of ideals and principles. 

If you go with that mindset, you can see her being so full of the shit given by her department that she chooses to be the ""bad girl going with the bad boy"". After all, if they made her feel like shit for doing her duty once, why she should do it again and ignore that this good looking japanese chad is a positive presence in her life? 

Most people don't live their lives trough big ideals and motivations, they try to do so while still answering their personal desires and feelings. She Is just a woman who can't see anymore the value in trying to be something more than what she is deep down."
Giri / Haji,I don’t understand why the killed Donna. It really pissed me off. I would have loved to see a spin-off show about her.
Giri / Haji,">They didn't really provide any reason she'd just go ""Okay, I'll help you with crime.""

Well, she's obviously in love with Kenzo."
Giri / Haji,"I thought the dance sequence was fantastic but also terrible. That is basically how I feel about the entire show. It's wild. I can't really explain it any better than that.

Edit: I will say that some parts just work better than others. Everything revolving around the Japanese characters is good to great (though wife's and mother's infiltration mission is a big place-palm-on-forehead moment), the wannabe Guy Ritchie gangster stuff doesn't work at all and the Rodney storyline has its ups and downs but mostly collapses by the end which is a shame because the actor is really good"
Giri / Haji,"I don’t agree with the OP, I thought it was absolutely fantastic.

Top 3 show of 2019 for me."
Giri / Haji,Sooo good
Giri / Haji,"I'm only up to episode 2 and OP nails it. I can only imagine how batshit it gets in later eps. I won't say it's not entertaining, but I also won't say it's A Good Show either. 

It's basically [this, but with police instead of doctors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_AmdvxbPT8)"
Giri / Haji,Completely agree
Giri / Haji,">Shun from Flowers

Who actually wrote and direct Flowers I believe too"
Giri / Haji,Way more bonkers.
Giri / Haji,"I mean that entirely depends on your expectations. With You I knew what I was getting even though they did turn it up to 11 in the second season.

With Giri / Haji what I expected was a fairly pedestrian BBC procedural with a bunch of Japanese supporting actors and what I got was a freewheeling genre mashup that culminates in a rooftop dance sequence."
Giri / Haji,"There is not a cliffhanger, you get a solid and satisfying conclusion."
Giri / Haji,"""Live action anime"" is exactly what I thought too. Or maybe a Takeshi Kitano yakuza movie by way of *Line of Duty,* while stumbling over an unfinished Danny Boyle screenplay. These madmen mashed together what feels like 5 different genres from 2 different countries. Their house of cards sure shakes a lot but it's still an impressive sight."
Giri / Haji,YES. There felt like no stakes. They literally just take a trip to the beach when Kenzo’s family are in danger . So confusing
Giri / Haji,Haji means shame in Japanese.
Giri / Haji,"For those of you confused about why the Muslim part is relevant: Muslims that do the pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj) are called Hajji. 

But I do like the idea of just throwing ""and I'm Muslim"" in at the end of random statements. ""How's the guacamole? I haven't tried it yet and I'm Muslim."""
Giri / Haji,Haji is Japanese for shame.
Giri / Haji,Because nobody outside GB will watch it on BBC but on Netflix.
Giri / Haji,So people know they can watch it there
Giri / Haji,"That's fair. I just finished it as well and that's basically how I feel overall. It's both loveablely good and loveablely bad. Some of the artistry feels out of place, but overall I enjoyed it.

Also I did find some of the characters' storylines a bit clunky, but Rodney and Abbot more than made up for that."
Giri / Haji,Same would have liked a bit more closure for characters like Rodney but overall it was a brilliant ride.
Giri / Haji,It was so good
Giri / Haji,"Just finished this series and I cannot believe that you would say this. Not a bad series by any means, but top three from 2019?"
Giri / Haji,The first half was great.   The second half was some of their worst TV I’ve seen in the last year.   Almost like it fell of a cliff and new people brought it back
Giri / Haji,"Ahhh

Ok"
Giri / Haji,That roof top standoff dance off was something else. Can't believe someone approved that.
Giri / Haji,"Yeah it's such an awesome show, surprised Reddit has been quiet about it."
Giri / Haji,Halfway done.  One of the best shows in a long time.
Giri / Haji,"Very good show, I suggested it to many friends and everyone loved it."
Giri / Haji,Just saw the trailer after your post and I'll definitely check it. Thanks.
Giri / Haji,"Just finished it, was sure there’d be huge discussion threads on reddit but found nothing. Amazing show. Just 9 episodes, and got better each episode. Highly recommend it"
Giri / Haji,"Halfway through and annoyed because I can't find much discussion on it :/ with Netflix shows I like going to the Reddit discussion threads after every episode.

[Spoiler question for ep 4](#s ""Was the reason Sarah's police boyfriend was arrested because he planted false evidence so the police could arrest the gang members and leader? If he did plant false evidence, why would someone also in the house accept it?"")"
Giri / Haji,"Yes, I watched it because I like Kelly MacDonald.  Totally not what I was expecting but I’m glad I watched it.  It was good."
Giri / Haji,fucking ROY
Giri / Haji,I need friends with taste lol guess thats why Im here
Giri / Haji,agreed.  I saw a trailer few months ago and impatiently waited for the NF release and was amazed as it actually turned out being really really good.  Also surprised it doesn't have more of a reddit presence
Giri / Haji,I was surprised not to see anything too. Great show. The link for question sent me to home page though
Giri / Haji,I’m from the UK and while it was well received (I loved it) it wasn’t the smash hit I’d hoped it’d be. Here’s hoping it takes off on Netflix. And Takehiro Hira is a *snack*.
Giri / Haji,I love how well cast every single part is. An absolute feast for anyone who loves character actors in particular.
Giri / Haji,"Thanks for the recommendation, never even heard of it but will definitely check it out"
Giri / Haji,Aw hell yeah.  I'm down for more Will Sharpe in *anything*.  This sounds good.
Giri / Haji,"Watched it a couple of weeks back when it dropped on Netflix. I'm pretty biased because I'm a sucker for anything Japanese, but I really enjoyed it! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime thriller."
Giri / Haji,"Thanks, I added to my queue. I prefer the foreign shows."
Giri / Haji,Posted about it a lil over a week ago because was shocked hadn’t seen much in it. LOVED it. Can’t wait for 2nd season
Giri / Haji,"I saw it a few months ago after it came out and it's an interesting mix of a cultural mash up and the last episode is a trip and reminds me of the last episode of ""Why Women Kill""."
Giri / Haji,"Thanks for posting this. I was going to make one myself, but was too lazy. Best show I've seen of 2019."
Giri / Haji,How much of it is in Japanese?
Giri / Haji,"Yosuke Kubozuka's been my favourite Japanese actor for so long, and seeing him in this was not only a pleasant surprise, but completely awesome. Absolutely loved this show."
Giri / Haji,"I am loving this show. Starting episode 5 and so far the interactions and dialogue feel very real in a way that I don't often see television shows doing, along with lovable characters and a good injection of humor. The East meets West approach is also very appealing and I hope that gives it a large audience from both sides."
Giri / Haji,Early on it was great.  Then it fell off a cliff for me
Giri / Haji,Great season!
Giri / Haji,"it wasn't on my home screen and i also had to search for it on netflix.  i was prompted to watch it after you recommended it on the main thread, halfway through now and really digging it -- thanks!"
Giri / Haji,I was looking for something to watch tonight. Does it have a “complete” story to its season? I’ve been burned by “to be continued” a lot lately.
Giri / Haji,"I enjoyed it for the most part - some yakuza clichés, but ok - but the last episode made it all fall apart for me. Especially when they started to dance, that was horrible and stank of ""we don't know what to put here, so let's put something wacky and pray that critics will call it original"" on the writers' part."
Giri / Haji,"It was not great, not terrible, but a good watch nonetheless"
Giri / Haji,"Good start, draggy in the middle, ok-ish on the later part. Overall, good watch. Just don't force yourself in watching it on one seating, you'll get bored."
Giri / Haji,"I thought it was just OK. Not bad but not worth the hype either. It was on a lot of 2019 'best of' lists. I'll admit the amount of subtitles was a bit much for me. Even though the majority of the show takes place in the UK, there is still a lot of Japanese."
Giri / Haji,"Is he the police officer? If he is I thought he did a phenomenal job!

Apparently it's from the studio which made Chernobyl so that should convince more people to give it a go"
Giri / Haji,by far the best character in the show
Giri / Haji,I'd say about 25%
Giri / Haji,Or danced off?
Giri / Haji,"It's more or less complete. Without spoiling it, it could continue with the same characters, or they could go the anthology route if they wanted."
Giri / Haji,I loved the dance personally. Idk if I've seen anything like that before on TV
Until Dawn,"I’d love to see it done well, but the very nature of what makes Lovecraft’s writing effective are difficult to translate to something cinematic, almost by definition."
Until Dawn,"My only concern is that Lovecraftian horror has never done well in box office, and studios seem to be really afraid to dive in on it. Annihilation from last year is the closest I've seen a modern movie come to Lovecraftian horror. The least well received part of the movie (the finale, which Paramount wanted to completely scrap) feels straight out of a Lovecraft story. I personally love very abstract horror, even if it ends up more disturbing than truly scary. Audiences though seem to find it either too high brow or too unconventional."
Until Dawn,"I bet building all the non euclidean sets would be a pain in the ass.

&#x200B;

Seriously though, instead of making a new show with a cosmic horror theme, next time an established show loses its main character due to sex crimes, they should just take that show completely off the rails with some lovecraftian shit.

&#x200B;

Imagine if after Netflix fired Kevin Spacey, the next season of House of Cards started up with the new President getting briefed on some Cabin in the Woods shit the secret one world Government runs to keep the Old Ones happy."
Until Dawn,[deleted]
Until Dawn,"Bloodborne is the greatest game i have ever played! And i think nothing comes closes as to how fromsoft adapted lovecraft's stories into the game. The world isn't ready, we lack insight. Grant us eyes, grant us eyes!"
Until Dawn,Shadow over innsmouth would be cool
Until Dawn,After the past ~15 or so odd of years of 'zombie' - 'cosmic horror' needs to really stand out. Bloodborne was amazing.
Until Dawn,Chernobyl was secretly cosmic horror.
Until Dawn,"“The next Game of Thrones will not be achieved if risks are not taken.”

Truer words have never been spoken. I really like this idea"
Until Dawn,"I thought [The Endless](https://www.google.com/search?kgmid=/g/11f006b8vc&hl=en-US&kgs=77962ea78770f042&q=The+Endless&shndl=0&source=sh/x/kp/osrp&entrypoint=sh/x/kp/osrp) (2018) was a pretty good romp for Lovecraft fans. Not based on a Lovecraft story, just nails the technique pretty well. Check it out!"
Until Dawn,"Since a significant part of this thread has gone towards discussing previous adaptations of his work or works that are Lovecraftian in nature, I thought I'd recommend the mini series Over the Garden Wall. It's very much not Lovecraftian in aesthetic (it's like Sleepy Hollow with hints of 20s Louisiana) but the story that is told as well as how it is told is Lovecraftian. It's also a cartoon with some goofy moments but overall unsettling and shrouded in mystery the whole way through. Big recommend."
Until Dawn,"Guillermo del Toro has been trying to adapt Mountains of Madness into a high budget film for a while. Really wish it would happen:

https://theoutline.com/post/3598/guillermo-del-toro-at-the-mountains-of-madness-revival?zd=2&zi=hnlkvmal"
Until Dawn,"I think the problem here is that some of these things are specifically described as “kind of like x and y, but not really because they’re completely indescribable.”  There are also a lot of them that are said to be so alien and incomprehensible that just looking at them induces madness.  It’s probably hard to include that as a visual element, so how and why would you convert the story to a visual medium?

All of that said, the game Sinking City launches this week and is based on Lovecraft, so we’ll see what it does."
Until Dawn,Would be cool to have 10 seasons of a high quality hbo series
Until Dawn,The colour of space? At the mountains of madness? The shadow out of time? THE RATS IN THE WALLS!
Until Dawn,How do you translate *the existential dread brought about by something being so unimaginably complex that it defies all notions of scale* to the big screen? The same way that you can't film Douglas Adams' Total Perspective Vortex.  It's just so hard to do
Until Dawn,"The only real way to adapt Lovecraft is to use his creations, but not his full stories (which would then piss off Lovecraft fans). I love his horror, but it’s not particularly emotional or cinematic."
Until Dawn,"include his cat as a running joke

what was his cat's name again?"
Until Dawn,"I don't know much about it, but I think for now, the closest thing we get might be the ""Lovecraft Country"" that J.J.Abrams and Jorden Peele are producing for HBO."
Until Dawn,"If the world is ready for it, it's not cosmic horror."
Until Dawn,"Give me The Outsider and The Music of Erich Zann, please."
Until Dawn,"I've found that with movies it's often those which are inspired by Lovecraft which end up being better Lovecraft movies than a lot which get adapted. The Void, for example, really is an incredibly underrated movie dripping in cosmic horror.

It just seems like a hard license to figure out for the big screen. Guillermo del Toro is giving At The Mountains of Madness a swing at it sometime this century though..."
Until Dawn,my dream is that david lynch makes a lovecraft inspired thing before lynch dies
Until Dawn,A videogame called Bloodborne adapted some of Lovecraft’s works into it.
Until Dawn,Ive been thinking of this a lot lately. It would be so amazing if done right
Until Dawn,Grant us eyes!
Until Dawn,You need directors who can create that sense of existential dread that Lovecraft is known for. Cary Fukunaga could do that I think. Who else? Thoughts?
Until Dawn,11. Old Man Henderson.
Until Dawn,"Or some live action Junji Ito. That would be cool.

There's definitely a hole in the movie industry made for cosmic horror."
Until Dawn,Guillermo Del Toro is the one I nominate to do this.
Until Dawn,How the fuck do you adapt a type of horror that is literally described as “unimaginable”?
Until Dawn,"I fully agree that the world may be ready for it. Thematically, people seem to progressively desire more 'darkness' in media. I'm personally aching for more cosmic horror/complete nihilism. Most of his work is hard to adapt, but I think it's doable. 

Colour Out of Space could be the best one to adapt (if someone can crack the actual visual depiction of the 'colour'). It kind of follows the physical and emotional destruction of a family, which I think gives the story a very personal and familiar feel"
Until Dawn,"For me, the thing about Lovecraft that makes him a lot of fun, is the unique voice that he writes in.

I'm not sure that can be replicated unless you had a director who is fucking amazing.   Lovecraft has this frenetic, almost desperate pacing to his use of words.  Any hack could use film to tell a story with the same basic plot elements Lovecraft uses, and make it boring.

[http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/nwwf.aspx](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/essays/nwwf.aspx)

&#x200B;

If you pay attention to how Lovecraft says he writes in this essay, he behaves a bit like his own creative team rather than one person.  First he writes the script.  Then he acts it out in his second-order story.  Finally he edits it.  That's what is going to make adapting him difficult.  You're not dealing with someone who merely wrote a story--you're dealing with an author who wrote his story, experienced it via imagination acting out characters, and then wrote about that experience.  It's how he makes the desperation and fear so personal and palpable."
Until Dawn,"Just please don't adapt that one about a street that is slowly ""infested"" by foreigners. 

Also maybe rename the cat in Rats in the Walls. That one might not fly."
Until Dawn,"They can adapt Call of Cthulhu as much as they want, but it wouldn't beat my first experience with it. Listening to an audio reading, in the dark, and with a migraine. It was a *really* fun experience."
Until Dawn,"“Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn."""
Until Dawn,"The Color Out of Space is highly adaptable too, its been done but could still be done again.  


Shout-out to the Darkest Dungeon DLC heavily based around it."
Until Dawn,This would be awesome!
Until Dawn,"""it was an horror so terryfying that cannot be described""

there's a lot of that in Lovecraft, there's a good documentary about this with interviews to good directors on this topic.

Until Dawn,"I'd definitely watch that, Dreams in the Witch-House, has pretty decent adaptation. I think it was part of a masters of horror series but one of the better produced ones."
Until Dawn,I think it's a great idea but I don't agree with some of your choices.  I think the temple would be a great place to start.
Until Dawn,"It’s ready for cosmic horror, but nobody would like a direct Lovecraft adaptation. People have probably been pitching them for decades and there’s a reason they don’t get picked up.

Now, Lovecraft’s use in the modern world is his influence on a few generations of creators. Stephen King and his son Joe Hill, China Mieville, Junji Ito, etc. They’ve all made some great Lovecraftian fiction."
Until Dawn,"Following the sea of similar comments, a concept like this has been tossed around for as long as there's been television. It's cool in theory, but extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, in execution. If you put a picture of a horror beyond description, you diminish the potential."
Until Dawn,You can buy his complete collection right now for 50 cents on google
Until Dawn,"https://youtu.be/8OTO7Rqln9Q this video gives a great insight into cosmic horror and why it'd be hard to be implemented. I'd definitely watch it if you haven't

Coming face to face with the unknowable or unnamable would have it's purpose defeated once you try to put a shape on it and show it to viewers- it wouldn't be unknowable anymore."
Until Dawn,H.P Lovecraft i pretty much love everything movie done about is work he was that amazing. Sci fi and horror.
Until Dawn,"Season 4 of Agents of Shield had them dealing with a kind of seductive book of evil written by the MCU version of the Lovecraftian god, and ghost rider, and robots. It was awesome."
Until Dawn,The Rats in the Walls could work if you did it right
Until Dawn,"What, no Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath? That read like a proper Hobbit book back in the day."
Until Dawn,"You see, the problem with cosmic horror is that it revels in obscurities and the unknown. As soon as someone tries to ""make"" something out of that unknown, it is no longer unknown, and hence most of the psychological suspense is ruined and you wind up with a relatively dumb monster movie.

&#x200B;

The only games that have done justice to Lovecraft's works would be Amnesia: Dark Descent and Bloodborne. Amnesia because it illustrates the madness of someone who is witnessing this stuff, impossible to tell if anything is fact or fiction all at the mercy of a merciless entity who seems to mostly just be toying with you. Bloodborne, because it has themes of Lovecraft, but the Soulsborne series itself revels in obscurities and unknowns, and most of the stuff you see is never truly revealed, yet you know there is some malevolence there, even if all they do is watch you, or at times speak with you, yet know far more than you do. That is the essence of cosmic horror. This type of storytelling makes for a really bad movie though.

&#x200B;

Why Cthulhu, Yog-Sottoth, and Nyarlathotep have remained so popular isn't because Lovecraft made them incredibly deep characters. He barely even described what they were. Almost everything about them has sprung from the imaginations of thousands of writers after him pondering humanity's primal fear of chaos and the unknown using his universe."
Until Dawn,Stuart Gordon needs some more love in this thread
Until Dawn,Just let Del Toro make a movie and go from there.
Until Dawn,"As someone who loves Horror moves like Hereditary, Witch, Babadook

And someone who loves TV shows which create atmosphere with music like Dark and Hannibal...

Please someone adapt Lovecraft who has an understanding of the medium enough to create dread inside a scene!"
Until Dawn,"I agree with you, but at the same time I don't think specific stories from Lovecraft would work due to reasons others mentioned; these involve unimaginable terrors that wouldn't work on screen, not to mention that they're so well known for the niche group of fans that there would hardly be any surprises plot-wise. 

I'd love a Lovecraft-**inspired** story instead, involving the same monsters/locations as a homage but on a smaller scope (perhaps main story would revolve around a cultist group or residents of a small town where madness is spreading). With the same formula of an educated sceptic finding out about something irrational and mystic, only to realise that this is the true reality of his/her world, as he/she ventures deeper into the truth.

There's so much potential here, even without awakening of the Elder Gods, moving to astral planes or making it a ""save the world"" scenario. Just an atmospheric horror with great story/character development with a bit of Lovecraft thrown in and I'd be instantly sold."
Until Dawn,"Just get Hidetaka Miyazaki.

Wouldn't get past the first episode"
Until Dawn,I think it's better off in gaming. Unless really well done somehow it looks cheesy on film.
Until Dawn,Isn't Jason X technically cosmic horror?
Until Dawn,Or just give me bloodborne 2. Turns out cosmic horror is more enjoyable when I can savagely beat it to death after it scares me
Until Dawn,The only way this would work was if you had nicolas cage play all the parts in the movie and do all the special effects as well.
Until Dawn,"Until any of that is made you could always watch anything political in the US or the EU, make sure to cover all parties stances and trust me you will never sleep again or end up in a padded cell wearing a very and I do mean very long sleeved shirt."
Until Dawn,Do it like the Coen Brothers adapted Buster Scruggs.  There's so many good ones.
Until Dawn,I'm all for cosmic horror.  If you are so inclined please look up the Laundry Files series of books by Charles Stross.  Pretty much James Bond + Cthulhu.
Until Dawn,"I'm sorry that you don't want to hear about the racism because it goes hand in hand with his work and it is not subtle.
In his short story ""He"" the main character is shown a dark future of New York where it has been taken over by demons and asians and the way he wrote it the Asians were the scarier prospect. There are plenty of other examples, horror at red hook, the evil old man, medusa's coil, call of cthulu and many others. Lovecraft's fear of the unknown and the other stims directly from his fear of foriegners. The human villians are nearly always Africans, Italians, Portuguese, Asians. If you are going to look at his work you can't just ignore the parts you find inconvenient, it's too ingrained."
Until Dawn,"I'd rather see an anthology that does cosmic horror/weird fiction from relevant modern writers: Laird Barron, Nathan Ballingrud (he's got a series coming out for his stories from North American Lake Monsters good for him), Jeffrey Ford, Gemma Files, Victor LaValle, Thomas Ligotti, Caitlin R Kiernan, Brian Evenson, Matthew M Bartlett, Jeff VanderMeer, the list goes on.

We're in the golden age of these genres right now and there's a lot of really good shit that could be riffed off of."
Until Dawn,in 2019? how do you think they will react to cat named N*ggerman?
Until Dawn,"I would love it, if it was done well.

The problem is fucking SJWs who would come out of the woodwork upon seeing he name. Because he was a virulent racist. I tend to think he was a product of his time. But as we all hear screamed at the top of their lungs everyone throughout history needs to be held to the standards of the moment it which we speak it."
Until Dawn,Please god no. His works don’t lend themselves to the medium at all. It’s much better to see original cosmic horror inspired by Lovecraft created specifically for television and film.
Until Dawn,It’s so difficult. Lovecraftian eldrich abominations are no longer that once they are given physical imaginable forms that are set and defined.
Until Dawn,"I'd love to see more cosmic horror on TV. It's basically the next best medium for it besides books and maybe podcasts. I think most networks just don't want to show any influence from Lovecraft's stuff because of his racist tendencies. You'd have to make pretty much the entire thing around that fact so people don't needlessly look for the wrong ideas. It *probably* would be fine just making a cosmic horror show that doesn't really reference HPL at all but with the budget that'd be required to make a show like that good, it's likely seen as too much of a risk right now. 

Once someone does the legwork of making a cosmic horror story in another medium first that properly takes Lovecraft out of the equation, we'll probably see a TV show on it within a few years. I haven't read nearly enough cosmic horror to know what authors might be able to pull something like that off though. 

Honestly, I just want a Bloodborne TV show more than anything else."
Until Dawn,"I couldn’t agree more. Lovecraft’s work hits on something deep and horrifying that can easily be brought over to a well done film adaptation.


Also to get a Lovecraft movie fix now I would strongly recommend the movie [In the Mouth of Madness by Carpenter ](https://youtu.be/gsavwK1gOJE) . It has very strong and direct influences from Lovecraft and is peak John Carpenter with some David Lynch themes thrown in."
Until Dawn,Theres a game coming out about cthulu called the sinking city
Until Dawn,"They'll screw it up, you know they will.

&#x200B;

Unless John Carpenter and/or Ti West direct every episode without studio  interference."
Until Dawn,"I thought the movie The Void really nailed the Lovecraftian horror down well. It had madness, cults, space-borne nightmare creatures, etc."
Until Dawn,True detective season one had cosmic horror?
Until Dawn,"Whenever lovecraft is mentioned nowadays, people are afraid of being called bad people and have to preface whatever they say with ""I know he's a racist, but..."" everyone needs to get over themselves. That same logic would apply to essentially every single author before 1950."
Until Dawn,"Legendary was gonna do it a couple years ago, but it never materialized."
Until Dawn,Don't forget Pickman's Model. One of my favorites
Until Dawn,"Yussss, I'd be all over this. But maybe choose Wayne June as the narrator?"
Until Dawn,"I dont think you can put his works to image and do it justice, his true greatness was getting you to craft your own horrific imagery"
Until Dawn,The worlds been ready for a while. Its the producers which are not ready to translate such ... undefined masterpiece
Until Dawn,No Innsmouth?
Until Dawn,"I love cosmic horror, but I feel like it's a genre difficult to adapt to the screen. A lot of the emotion associated with it comes from fear of the unknown, or the idea that we lack an understanding of the universe. This usually doesn't translate very well in visuals, though it's not impossible. Stuff like the ""things"" you couldn't see in Bird Box (I know lots of people don't like this movie, but I thought the unknown aspect of it was well done), the mind-trippy vision in Dr. Strange, and the Apostles in the Berserk manga are evocative of aspects of cosmic horror. But still, I feel like good visual representations of this genre are few and far between."
Until Dawn,"Honestly I think one might have better luck adapting something like *Providence* accurately. The issue with anything episodic like this is character - GOT worked on a huge scale because audience connected to the characters - you lose that bond in an anthology show, even with a narrator.

Still, something could be dope. There’s a show in development now called *Lovecraft County* (I think) that’s aiming to loop a lot of his lore into some kind of continuing narrative.."
Until Dawn,"My word, made in the same way-is as Chernobyl, it could be the best mini series ever, for sure. The Dunwich Horror is fantastic."
Until Dawn,"I think cosmic horror in general is already becoming fairly common (really getting going with the first Hellboy movie, I think), but Overly Sarcastic Productions shows why [his stories, while at their core effective, might be a little hard to adapt and still remain scary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmdzptbykzI).

Lovecraft is a very text-horror writer, often leaving it up to the imagination of the reader as to what the scary thing is like. If you can't translate that well, then you have to paint really compelling characters to be invested in, and... that's not Lovecraft's strong suit."
Until Dawn,"You would like the game edge of nowhere. It's essentially an adaptation of ""at the mountains of madness""."
Until Dawn,They were going to have a lot of HP Lovecraftian style stuff on TV but then they cut all the magic out of game of thrones and now we have nothing left.
Until Dawn,JJ Abram should do this with Warner Bros
Until Dawn,Check out Channel Zero. It's a horror anthology show that's pretty well done. Every season is at least pretty good but Butcher's Block (season 3) has a pretty cosmic horror vibe.
Until Dawn,"Until vr becomes the norm in home television viewing, I don’t want it. Yet."
Until Dawn,"It’s very hard, in a visual medium, to depict something that, when looked upon, will drive you mad."
Until Dawn,"I think the issue is that most of Lovecraft'd stories are kind of flat from a character perspective. You could loosely adapt a lot of them, but you'd have to completely gut most of the stories."
Until Dawn,"I don't think this'll be that great of an idea, as the horror of Lovecraft's stories relies on the fear of the unkown, and taking . that element away, (unless they don't show any of the 'monsters') will greatly reduce the fear"
Until Dawn,"I've been really excited for an independent Lovecraft adaption that has been in the works. For his dream cycle series, it is called the Dreamlands and it has been in the works for a few years. Check out the trailer, looks really promising! https://youtu.be/zEiC4a6PLcI"
Until Dawn,No it'll just be some teen drama
Until Dawn,What director would be able to pull off a great Lovecraft adaption?  I think you would almost have to use narration and dialogue straight from the stories to keep the same vibes.  I loved the 2013 'Cool Air' adaption because of that.  'Patient 17' isn't a direct adaption but it's one that I really liked.   The 'Cloverfield' trilogy was genius when they tied the origin of the monster to the humans themselves.
Until Dawn,"We've got ""The Last Lovecraft"", what more do we need?"
Until Dawn,Im currently working on adapting the Call of Cthulhu into an Opera!
Until Dawn,"There is a Beyond the Wall Of Sleep movie that my wife has a small part in:

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279688/"
Until Dawn,Wayne June would be the perfect narrator for the job.
AJ and the Queen,"Considering Netflix practically guarantees any new shows at least 2 season, this must have been exceptionally terrible."
AJ and the Queen,All 36 people who watched are going to be devastated.
AJ and the Queen,"I love ru paul, and drag in general, but I couldn’t stand this show. Barely got through the first episode."
AJ and the Queen,"Not a shocker.  It was possibly the worst show I've seen in a long time.  Awful writing, awful acting.... Just bad."
AJ and the Queen,"Good, this was unwatchable, a complete misstep."
AJ and the Queen,"Netflix thinks LGBT representation attracts views, and thought this would be a hit based on being heresy to say otherwise. Doesn't change that real people do not care about representation without a solid product associated."
AJ and the Queen,"I guess I'm the only one who liked this show. It was sappy, cute and Tia Carrere was hilarious."
AJ and the Queen,"Not the greatest show in the world, but man there were some great moments! Fucking Oprah tapes had me crying! Haha"
AJ and the Queen,You don’t say
AJ and the Queen,"I love RuPaul, but his acting needs work. The writing for this show was also bad. No driving conflict; it felt like scenes strung together. I made it through two and a half episodes, and that's only because I love RuPaul and RPDR. If it wasn't for that, I would've turned it off halfway through the first episode."
AJ and the Queen,"Damn. I'm disappointed. The sub on here for the TV show somehow ran with a rumor that it got renewed... 

So this is disappointing for mega fans of the series and Ru that thought it was already renewed."
AJ and the Queen,"They came, they virtue signaled, they ~~conquered~~ canceled."
AJ and the Queen,"I really love this show, Ru has range."
AJ and the Queen,“Canceled after one season at Netflix” is a very common phrase
AJ and the Queen,"So disappointed. The first episode was rough, but after that I loved the show."
AJ and the Queen,"That's not always the case, granted. Tuca & Bertie was cancelled a month or two after premiere of its first season; curiously, this was just after the studio unionized and their other show (Bojack) was cancelled around the same time."
AJ and the Queen,Only past tense.
AJ and the Queen,I love drag race but this was a pile of shit. I couldn't stand the kid actor. I had to dip after the first episode too.
AJ and the Queen,Same.   Could not watch.
AJ and the Queen,"I think its biggest flaw is each episode ***was an hour long***. It forced itself to fit an extra half hour of content for each episode and it shows. 

I love Ru and watched it out of support, but this show was all over the place. They didn't know what they wanted to do with their story and it was all just incredibly messy with some contrived interactions and plot. 

It was great seeing all those queens cameo, but the mainstory was a mess. Worse that it ended on a sorta cliffhanger"
AJ and the Queen,Agreed. I thought it was wholesome in comparison to all the other shows. Sad to not know what happens to AJ
AJ and the Queen,I loved it!
AJ and the Queen,"Yes! Lots of really good one-liners. Not the worst show, not the best."
AJ and the Queen,There were mega fans of this?
AJ and the Queen,"Boy, you sure tried shoehorning that in. You sure tried."
AJ and the Queen,"And Tuca and Bertie had a lot more people who would say it was really good than AJ and the Queen did.  I know I liked it more, and I'm practically the target audience for AJ and the Queen."
AJ and the Queen,Writer from bojack have said that this wasn’t the case and have pointed out that Netflix works with shows that a unionized
AJ and the Queen,I think the biggest issue was that it was written and starring Ru..... :p
AJ and the Queen,"What do you mean when you say ""all the other shows? There are much more wholesome shows on Netflix"
AJ and the Queen,He dies.
AJ and the Queen,Inexplicable mega fans are a staple of the internet. I understand it with long running stories because even bad they have investment. But short shows it makes no sense to me
AJ and the Queen,I imagine mega fans of Ru Paul are immediate mega fans of the show
AJ and the Queen,"Not really.  I'm a huge Ru Paul fan so I gave it a shot and went into it with a very forgiving attitude, but I still didn't like it that much.  I'm not going to hate on it as much as a lot of the other people here (it did have some sweet and funny moments), but just because you like a star doesn't mean you'll like everything they do."
AJ and the Queen,"I didn't like it, the acting was bad and I don't need an overdose of Rupaul; I love the RPDR queens, but I'm sick of Ru and her shallow, wealthy boomer mindset."
AJ and the Queen,"Sad more people aren't talking about this, it's actually very good. A lot of charm and heart and it made me laugh out loud several times in the first three eps, which is all I've seen so far. I wasn't sure if I'd like it since Drag Race isn't my thing. Looking forward to seeing the rest."
AJ and the Queen,"Ok so there are some elements of this show that were enjoyable: the lewks, all the drag race queens, Louis, etc. Overall it seemed to lack a clear point of view, and most of the story is not that interesting. The kid was insufferable. How the tuck is mama ru going to make a show and not have at least a Michelle cameo?"
AJ and the Queen,"How is this so bad with all the money invested ? Watched first episode.. completely predictable...  Jokes not landing ... They present the kid in a very annoying way so there is no ."".oh poor little kid"".  It's all in the script for this campy shows and there is poor writing and lukewarm deliverance...."
AJ and the Queen,"Shocking at how they choose to release it at this state. 

It's not terrible. I was expecting more. The best bits are when the show don't take itself too seriously - the banter between ruby and cocoa, and generally fun interactions between the characters. Those are funny!

But the relationship between aj and ruby feels so contrived.

The script is all over the place."
AJ and the Queen,"Watched the first two episodes and so far it's quite good.

Theres heart, humour and character development. 

Definitely one to watch"
AJ and the Queen,"This series has so much soul. It’s an emotional roller coaster. I’m laughing my ass off one minute and crying the next, then laugh-crying then cry-laughing. It is SO good. There are so many 80’s in-jokes, cameos and callbacks. I’ll have to watch it again to pick up on all the background jokes I missed the first time. The little girl is such an amazing actor. And RuPaul absolutely bares everything, pores, wrinkles and all. The veneer comes off and you see the real person. It is so brave and heartwarming.  There is campy acting in places that is TOTALLY on purpose, like the bad guys temper tantrum in the bed. It just screams with comedy, yet the painful scenes have really really serious, and really really good acting that hits you in the feels hard. 

The pacing of the first few episodes seem quite slow but picks up in the rest of the series. It is still quite slow compared to most modern shows but gives an overall feel-good pacing like Schitts Creek, but has WAY more laughs and tears."
AJ and the Queen,"It is a shame RuPaul is such a terrible actor because otherwise this could be quite good. To his credit, the writing is pretty bad it would take a lot of skill to turn this to something more digestible"
AJ and the Queen,I honestly don’t think I’ve experienced child acting that bad. It’s honestly irritating. I mean the adult acting isn’t any better by any means. And maybe the kids just given a bad script. I love ru Paul. What a star. But an acting one? No not really. Just because you can lip sync doesn’t mean you can act. People should also be telling tic toc kids that too. Probably where they found that little girl. You can make me feel for a character when every moment she’s just being annoying.
AJ and the Queen,"After 3 episodes,I finally put a tourniquet on my suffering and sacrificed the time already lost. I couldn't imagine worse TV."
AJ and the Queen,"Couldn’t get past the 30 blind jokes in the very first episode. Literally the definition of lazy comedy. I love RuPaul but this show is awful. The pacing is so slow, the writing is terrible, and the comedy is almost nonexistent."
AJ and the Queen,"This is a tv show i‘m letting run in the background while i do other things. With this, i miss out on most of the bad jokes and acting. Also, i don’t think Dragqueens are for kids. I don‘t like the fact that the kid is watching some of these shows, but gets told to stay away from the changing rooms with all the tucking going on..
That‘s the most disturbing part about this show."
AJ and the Queen,"This was one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I'm a huge fan of the RuGirls, and love seeing them featured. However, that was the ONLY redeeming quality of this series. A friend of mine posted, ""I felt something was missing..."" to which I replied, ""Yeah, like a plot, good writing, passable acting"". I can excuse the show if it realized how bad it is, but you know that RuPaul and Michael Patrick King (who seems only to be able to write in the style of Sex and the City... a show that has NOT aged well over a decade later) thought it was a great, meaningful piece of television. I don't get offended by much, but just the fact that every episode had to have a joke about blind people was completely offputting. Throw in a charmless performance by the kid, who spends most of the show yelling like a brat and RuPaul's lsck of acting range (which is ironic, considering how much flack she gives her contestants when they put in static performances on Drag Race) and you have a whiney, pointless mess that makes you wonder who the heck is greenlighting this dreck at Netflix."
AJ and the Queen,I just finished the first episode.  I really enjoyed it and will continue watching.
AJ and the Queen,What an awful way to start 2020. I'm honestly surprised this is the best Rupaul could come up with.
AJ and the Queen,"Im still into it, barely and only because of the girl AJ. i dont have enough fingers to count how many times i would have slapped that kid for cockin that kind of attitude with me, the screaming, rudeness, stealing.. get the fuck outta my RV."
AJ and the Queen,"This podcast does a pretty hilarious review of the first two episodes:
https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/united-queendom-podcast/id1482277960?i=1000463428016"
AJ and the Queen,"These days there are so many new shows, I wait until after more people have had a chance to watch it so I can read reviews and determine if it's worth watching or"
AJ and the Queen,"Lacking a clear point of view is part of what makes the ending satisfying though. Even if you don't want to watch the end, go to episode 10 and listen to Robert's final line. I get why not everyone will like this but as someone who's a comedy nerd and really doesn't like crap TV, for me, this is something RuPaul should be very proud of."
AJ and the Queen,"I always enjoy itwhen people rubbish a TV show which is clearly heavily plot focused and then complain that the first episode seems slow...yeah, it's slow. The rest of the series is really good, particularly the subplot with Tia Carrera."
AJ and the Queen,">There is campy acting in places that is TOTALLY on purpose

Camp is one thing. Bad acting with limited range is another.

Ru has his strength. He shines in the comedic banter with other characters. But the deeper emotional scenes... It wasn't easy to watch. I don't feel anything coming from him."
AJ and the Queen,Ru does well in silly and light scenes. He doesn't have the range to pull off emotional scenes and it shows.
AJ and the Queen,It was written and produced by RuPaul. All the blame rest solely on him. It's awful TV.
AJ and the Queen,You don't see the difference between having a child in an adult dressing room vs watching a drag show?
AJ and the Queen,"The writing feels schizophrenic. It's like various people patched it with their own style and it isn't cohesive.

Netflix greenlighted it cause drag race is a hit and they think mama ru shits golden egg."
AJ and the Queen,Yea you are right. I watched it until the end and the show gets significantly better once the kid starts to be less insufferable and Ru enjoys himself a little more.
AJ and the Queen,I watched it til the end. It isnt the worst but the acting is really rough. The onky parts of the show that feel organic are when Ru is in drag. Most of the RuGirls outact RuPaul.
AJ and the Queen,That is not what i said. But i do think that both of these things are not for kids.
AJ and the Queen,"Aside from certain *specific* queens who bill themselves and their performances as a more adult show (but, again, that's merely a subset)...

There are plenty of queens whose persona & performances are family-friendly.

Drag Shows & Drag Performers aren't inherently ""inappropriate""...not unlike any other entertainment genres (eg. comedians, actors, videogames, etc)....that's just a myth & prejudicial generalization.

Edit: typo"
AJ and the Queen,"Might be, but i haven‘t seen a family-friendly drag show in this series. I don‘t mean to hate on drag shows i just really don‘t think they are for kids."
AJ and the Queen,"When I say Drag Show I mean drag performances, drag cons, drag restaurants, drag brunch...not necessarily RPDR or any other drag TV series. 

My point is there is nothing inherently inappropriate about drag or drag queens. 

The only thing inappropriate about RPDR really is the language and the occasional sexual innuendo...but that's not about *drag* being inappropriate - it's about a TV show with mature language and sexual innuendo being possibly ""inappropriate."""
AJ and the Queen,"She gets better halfway thru. Shes been screwed so it literally takes her a second to trust ruby. Its so good and rewarding at the end. Keep going please, i hated the lil bitch til the turning point too. There is a turning point tho"
AJ and the Queen,She gets less screen time in some episodes so those ones are better but she’s annoying as fuck the entire time.
AJ and the Queen,"It gets better, I watched it a while ago and can’t wait for season 2!!"
AJ and the Queen,"It gets better.

They try to give the kid some arc that explains the crabbiness."
AJ and the Queen,I watched a good amount and still hated AJ she doesn't get better and it seems they just told the actor any emotion just yell. Gets real old real fast.
AJ and the Queen,"If you like drag queens and drag persivere because there are some great dresses and wigs, but the kid doesn't get any better."
AJ and the Queen,"She gets a lot better and a lot more of a real kid instead of a tv kid. She'll still be sarcastic and too...blasé about shit, but unlike the first 2-3 episodes it's in a believable way given what we know about AJ's background."
AJ and the Queen,"I finish two episodes as well, she is very annoying and mean. I seen kids like these, but they all had terrible home lives. It makes sense."
AJ and the Queen,"I loved it. Yes at times RuPaul overacted and badly, but it was very heartwarming and one of those guilty pleasure shows."
AJ and the Queen,Cant wait for 2nd season either
AJ and the Queen,Thanks for the advice. Life is too short to waste on this
AJ and the Queen,Looks exactly like what I was hoping for. Looking forward to it.
AJ and the Queen,"Haven’t been this excited for a Netflix original since Love, Death, and Robots!!"
AJ and the Queen,[deleted]
AJ and the Queen,This actually looks really really good! Excited to see Ru in something other than Drag Race again
AJ and the Queen,Looks pretty fun
AJ and the Queen,"It's out now. Watched it. The trailer is cut much better than the show itself. If only they can keep up the pace, it would've been much better"
AJ and the Queen,"It is, in its own way."
AJ and the Queen,"""From Michael Patrick King"" could be a good thing or a bad thing. I absolutely loved ""The Comeback"" but ""2 Broke Girls"" was just painful.  Hopefully since it's on Netflix and not network TV, they won't have anything to hold them back."
AJ and the Queen,"Ru Paul's shows are always wild, wanna check it out"
AJ and the Queen,Its what she deserves
AJ and the Queen,He was also the showrunner/main writer for *Sex and the City* which I happened to rewatch recently. Aesthetically it's incredibly dated. The writing however remained sharp and insightful. Maybe he can bring that touch to what looks like is going to be a road trip comedy.
AJ and the Queen,And he did The Comeback w Lisa kudrow which perfection for me!
AJ and the Queen,"> Carrere is a two time Grammy Award winner 

:D what?"
AJ and the Queen,">AJ, a recently orphaned, tough-talking, scrappy 11-year-old stowaway.

Well, that's going to be hit or miss"
AJ and the Queen,"Never thought I’d see a show about Tony Soprano’s son, but OK."

Where Stars Land,"> **Amanda Abbington has revealed she believes “nepotism” helped land her role in hit BBC drama Sherlock.**

> Abbington was cast as Mary Watson, the wife of Sherlock Holmes’ friend and detective partner Doctor John Watson in 2014. At the time, Abbington was in a long-term relationship with Martin Freeman, who played Watson.


> **“Because I was with Martin at the time, there was a lot of [accusations of] nepotism being banded about,” she told the Full Disclosure podcast. “It’s true, it was that.**

>  “Both Mark [Gatiss] and Steven [Moffat, the show’s writers] said **they were trying to figure out who the best person would be to play Mary and they thought it would be the person who was going out with him.**


> “It made sense. And we’d worked together on many things.”"
Where Stars Land,"Would you call that nepotism? They cast Benedicts real life parents as Sherlocks parents, so why not Martins partner as Mary?  Would they have done it if she wasn't an actor?"
Where Stars Land,Terribly written character.  Wasn't sad to see her die
Where Stars Land,"Good for her to talk freely about it, although I'm not sure why she is doing it"
Where Stars Land,"The nepo baby thing is dumb cause it exists in every industry. Somewhere out there there’s a hospital director in a hospital giving unearned raises/jobs to their kin. There’s a blue collar warehouse manager doing it. There’s a McDonald’s owner doing it. 

There’s nothing wrong with using connections to get the job initially, the problem is if you underperform/mess up the and the favoritism doesn’t stop. Kind of like Clint Eastwoods son who can’t act for shit."
Where Stars Land,"No shit, Amanda.  It did nothing good for the show too."
Where Stars Land,"Good for her. It’s not just what you know, it’s who you know."
Where Stars Land,It would be news if an actor WASN'T helped by nepotism
Where Stars Land,"Quite funny she failed the audition to be his girlfriend in the office. Ricky gervais would mention Martin and her occasionally on his xfm radio showcase they used to socialize together. Bet that was awkward

But this is a nothing headline isn't it? It's very different nepo baby issues.

Matthew McFadden and Keeley Hawes just played a husband and wife in a itv series about a real MP who faked his death. That must have been weird to play and then go home together!"
Where Stars Land,[deleted]
Where Stars Land,Who?
Where Stars Land,"I suppose at least she's honest about it.  She wasn't my favorite character on the show, but I blame the writing for that more than the acting."
Where Stars Land,"To be fair, this is the BBC where nepotism is rife. 

It’s an old boys club, not so much in terms of gender, but the amount of people who make it to the BBC who come from wealthy, connected and independent/privately educated backgrounds. Something like 7% of all people in the UK are privately educated, yet they make up a far higher proportion of BBC ‘talent’. 

For a broadcasting service that is supposed to be representative of us - the people who watch and pay for it - it’s pretty disappointing to be honest."
Where Stars Land,"Yeah, I don't care about nepotism if that person is actually involved with the project.

Like, who would give a shit if a director cast their so-so actress daughter in one of their films, it's a different thing entirely if he pulls some strings to get her cast in an unrelated project."
Where Stars Land,A reporter asked
Where Stars Land,"Arguably, the Hollywood difference is that it's an industry with relatively limited spots for who gets to star in a (non-independent) movie or TV show, and all of them are built on so many levels of gatekeeping.

There's thousands and thousands of hospitals and blue collar warehouses and McDonald's locations. Each movie studio only makes a dozen-ish movies a year. Each network only makes so many scripted series a year."
Where Stars Land,"It's not really about nepotism per se, it's about these so-called nepo babies acting like they got to where they are now all because of their hard work and being better than others. They refuse to acknowledge that nepotism played a major part in that. That's the real issue at hand.

They would have never gotten there without nepotism."
Where Stars Land,"I got my first Job out of college thanks to my roomates Dad.  He worked for the company in another department.  He headed the hardware side of IT.  They lost a software engineer and I had just graduated with my degree in software engineering.  He told me to apply and I did.

I still needed to get thourgh the interview process, but his recommendation helped me as a fresh college grad with no industry experience.  It's turned out great.  I got a job my direct supervisors very happy with my preformance, and I got promoted recently, but without that connection there is no garuntee I would have got my  foot in the door.

Connections are important they can open doors and give you opportunities.  As long as you got the talent and skill to capitalize on those opportunities it's fine imo."
Where Stars Land,"It's called family business, which was the backbone of this country. So why it is a ""thing"" now when there is a whole lot of actual bad things going on in the world, & people keep bringing this up....

BTW, I grew up in a family business, as did my parents(different business industry). And it's how I learned from that experience along with going to school for it-to have my own for over 25 years.

Her getting this role, due to being in a relationship is one thing that makes sense for the role she played. People always go one about how this or that couple have ""no chemistry"". Well this is one way to obtain it onscreen."
Where Stars Land,"Agreed.  I got my first job because of my dad and then a couple of years later, my mum joined us both.  In my case, they needed warm bodies to fill space and i needed a job, and in my mums case, she made my life hell.  I wouldn't call myself a nepotism baby in that sense but I'd call her worse."
Where Stars Land,But Scott Eastwood was perfect for a Taylor Swift music video.
Where Stars Land,"Nepotism is about power. Who holds power and how it is used. Denying power dynamics in any industry is disastrous. Wealth brings a lot of power. In a place like the US, it's the difference between having a good attorney and getting a light sentence or being stuck in jail for months without being charged. I mean look at SFG. He's on $250million bail chilling at his parents' mansion. Most parents in the world don't have that kind of power.

So in acting which can be a very secretive, back channel deal kind of industry, power means access to people and opportunities that other people are shut out from. There are no repercussions if Jess Smith from Wolverton didn't get the part. But there may be very real repercussions if Major Movie Star's child doesn't get the part. People in the industry who don't have that kind of power aren't dumb. They know how precarious things can be. It's only the people who have only ever known access and power who think that it does not make their road smooth."
Where Stars Land,I liked her in the show
Where Stars Land,"Surely, that was the idea?

You didn't want somebody that looked perfect with Tim, because the aim was to make Dawn look like a much better fit?"
Where Stars Land,Would you recommend the Mathew/Keeley show? I like them both so much!
Where Stars Land,"Lies, she's married to David Mitchell. [I have video evidence!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZyuNfEIGpo)"
Where Stars Land,"“You were a really strong candidate, the best actually, but the position has been filled”…"
Where Stars Land,"Honestly, she seemed to be the only interesting bit of that terrible S3E1 episode and had some promise- until she got killed off unceremoniously.

That being said, S3 was around the time everyone noticed the wheels falling off (not just the people who thought they were getting a mystery show when it was mostly an action thing to begin with), so that probably made her worse than she could have been too..."
Where Stars Land,That’s still nepotism…
Where Stars Land,[until the showrunner casts his lookalike daughters as two unrelated characters](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FD2a5zoWQAon2_X.jpg)
Where Stars Land,"I agree, the comparison with Mc Donald’s and the hospitals is nonsensical, nepotism really only hurts an industry with limited spots. 

That’s why it is such a problem in the movie industry and not so much in the fast food sector."
Where Stars Land,"My personal pet peeve is when I hear them say things like ""I used a pseudonym so I wouldn't get preferential treatment in the industry."" Like, you can't be that naive. It's fine, dude, you're obviously talented, it's ok to say you got a leg up.

Allison Williams really has the right attitude."
Where Stars Land,"Yea, as long as people are honest and grateful and recognize how lucky they are they’ll get a lot of leeway."
Where Stars Land,"There is a difference between a family business, and people getting hired for jobs in a business that is not owned by their family because of personal relationships.

Also, not caring about a thing, because there are other things that are worse isn't a sign of great intelligence.

And if you do want to us that argument: nepotism is part of a bigger problem, people gaining power and influence because of social background rather than knowledge and skill.

That would be less of a problem is society made it easier for people who don't have a support network to get ahead in life."
Where Stars Land,"I mean there’s nothing necessarily “wrong” with it per se. As you said family businesses are a thing and there’s nothing necessarily wrong with those. 

I believe what people have issue with is when people who were a product of nepotism or got where there are because they were in a family business act like they did it all on their own or were somehow better than others etc. 

Using the term “nepo baby” is calling out those people. It’s like saying “no you didn’t get to where you are because you’re so much better than other qualified people, you just had help from your family.”"
Where Stars Land,I always thought that other one had amazing chemistry tbh 🤣🤷‍♂️
Where Stars Land,It was good. Nothing amazing but a fun little story especially if you don't know about it all
Where Stars Land,"the show kinda jumped the shark after Moriarty and Sherlock's ""death.""  Moriarty was amazing and everything after that was just ok, at best."
Where Stars Land,"They never suggested otherwise. Their first sentence reads ""I don't care about nepotism **if**...""

You're free to disagree and say these examples of nepotism are still wrong but pay attention to what is actually being argued."
Where Stars Land,"The ""oh and by the way we've worked together before and have chemistry that could be important in a series that is heavily reliant on chemistry."" being slipped in at the end of the quote is a little bit of a throw."
Where Stars Land,"You put it together so we’ll, take the award!"
Where Stars Land,Thankssss
Where Stars Land,OUTLAW COUNTRY!!
Where Stars Land,Arrested Development joke here Michael
Where Stars Land,Started watching this show not expecting much. Every episode has been fantastic. Good story development. The characters are all unique and likable. The cast and crew should all be proud of what they’re making with Reboot.
Where Stars Land,"Take a good look, cause it's the last time you're gonna see 'em."
Where Stars Land,"""YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!!!"""
Where Stars Land,[removed]
Where Stars Land,"She's been topless in a lot of movies, I don't see why this is even notable?"
Where Stars Land,She was great on the fx show married too
Where Stars Land,Spring Break!!
Where Stars Land,More or less wasted in the MCU as Ant Man’s ex wife for some reason. She was great for the big part. But I hope they can use her again as some cool alien or villain later on. She wants to do action!
Where Stars Land,I’m confused by this headline and article. I mean I’m sure there’s Dot and Enzo out there somewhere because .. ya know.. Rule 34 but was she the voice of Dot or something?
Where Stars Land,"Glasses on, hair up or glasses off, hair down?"
Where Stars Land,Good ole Charlene … I mean Chrystal!
Where Stars Land,Her boobs are amazing! :D
Where Stars Land,I've loved Judy since Jawbreaker and she's only gotten better and better.
Where Stars Land,It's nice to know there were some amazing cans behind that censor blur all these years
Where Stars Land,"Say hello to these, Michael!"
Where Stars Land,Just give her a couple Groovy Bears and she's ready to go
Where Stars Land,"NGL, seeing Judy Greer's boobs does make me more interested in that show."
Where Stars Land,I got to hang out with her for a few hours a couple years back and she was super cool
Where Stars Land,Okay but renew the show Disney.
Where Stars Land,She’s a smoke show.
Where Stars Land,Judy is absolutely underrated. She is a fucking powerhouse actor and a comedic riot. Love to see her getting her flowers whenever possible. Such a talent.
Where Stars Land,"To be fair at least, they are very nice boobs."
Where Stars Land,"I dated a girl briefly that looked like Judy Greer...I miss her...Amanda, message me."
Where Stars Land,"Reboot is so weird. The first episode started vicious and edgy and had boobs and I thought, ""wow, the showrunner from *Modern Family* is shaking off his network TV roots"".

Every subsequent episode has felt more and more like a generic ABC sitcom. 

*Episodes* with Matt Leblanc is kind of a similar inside baseball look at showbiz that this show feels like a family friendly knockoff of. 

I'm still watching Reboot but it's really missing something."
Where Stars Land,I love you Judy Greer. Keep being awesome.
Where Stars Land,Judy Greer has a great career
Where Stars Land,">they’re just boobs

And what lovely ones they are, too. Always did have a bit of a crush on her in my youth."
Where Stars Land,"Unrelated but she has a book called ""I Don't Know What You Know Me From"" and it's pretty good. I've always liked her. She does the audiobook version too."
Where Stars Land,"Say ""Hello"" to THESE!"
Where Stars Land,So... this is definitely not a reboot of the 90's cartoon ReBoot?
Where Stars Land,I guess it wasn’t the last time we were going to see ‘em
Where Stars Land,I was pleasantly surprised by this show.
Where Stars Land,"Not to mention that usually when a titty drops they have to make some weird big deal around it in shows, usually. In “Reboot” it felt well timed and added to the comedy."
Where Stars Land,"Fern Mayo, why I never..."
Where Stars Land,she's the shit
Where Stars Land,"Yeah, until your costar gets a boner on set."
Where Stars Land,"What a cheap way to advertise ""hey! Judy Greer nude over here!""

Reading the thread the show sounds like damn near a must watch, though."
Where Stars Land,Reboot feels like a 30 rock fever dream
Where Stars Land,I've always remembered her as Trixie from Californication
Where Stars Land,She gets better every day.
Where Stars Land,"I agree it did become much tamer and sometimes cheesy as it went on.

But I don’t think it’s missing anything. I think the finale was perfect and the characters are flawless so far."
Where Stars Land,"Watched it as it aired and loved it. 100% started watching it because Greer being in Archer, and Hulu suggested it because I watch that show. Love this and hope they get a second season."
Where Stars Land,Best joke in AD was that she was not smoking hot.
Where Stars Land,“And say goodbye to these...”
Where Stars Land,"Okay Dennis, I’m confused. These are just pictures of women with giant breasts."
Where Stars Land,"Every time I hear about this show, my disappointment grows tenfold that we didn’t get a proper ReBoot continuation."
Where Stars Land,Say goodbye to these Michael!
Where Stars Land,"Sees Reboot in title , realize it’s not about the awesome 90s TV show. Gets bummed out."
Where Stars Land,"I love this woman, she can be funny and serious, amazing as an actor and voice actor, never understood why she never got better gigs."
Where Stars Land,"Judy Greer is my favorite actress. I wish I could find an old post, I basically typed a novel about her. 

Long and short of it. I think she’s hilarious, and nails every comedic role she plays. I haven’t seen her serious emotional chick movies, but I’m sure she killed it there too. 

Maybe it’s just that I’m getting older too, but I think she is just as smoking hot today as she was in Caifornication 15 years ago."
Where Stars Land,What a great show.
Where Stars Land,This show is so fucking funny! Fantastic cast for real
Where Stars Land,I saw the first episode. If I was her I would be proudly showing those off at that age all the time.
Where Stars Land,She has fantastic boobs
Where Stars Land,Judy Greer.  One of my favorite actresses.  I love how her career has blossomed in her later years compared to her earlier years.
Where Stars Land,"She’s always been an A+ Hottie. I’m here for this. 

I feel like as we get older we become more comfortable in our bodies and grow out of a lot of our dysmorphic bullshit. 

Obviously not all. And it often goes the other way *cough* Madonna *cough* in rich people. 

But I think a lot of us as we get older stop giving a flying fuck what anyone thinks about the way we look. 

Maybe that’s just me turning 40 projecting tho. I dunno."
While You Were Sleeping,LOVE that show! Reminds me of season 1 Riverdale
While You Were Sleeping,"I actually find this show to be one of the better CW shows they've put out recently. Like yeah, it's still YA garbage, but as I'm watching it I'm not rolling my eyes at all the main characters' actions/reactions all the time."
While You Were Sleeping,Cable in hotel rooms is definitely one of my favorite parts of work travel. I wouldn’t want it permanently but it’s fun to revisit once in a while.
While You Were Sleeping,"I loved those moments of calling your friend during the commercials when you talked about what just happened and what you think will happen after the commercials finish and the show returns. It's, ""Okay, it's on again. I'll call you next commercial!""

I remember this was how my sister and I watched the finale of Avatar. She was in a different state than me at the time. So, we couldn't watch it together in the same house. But knowing she was watching the live airing at the same time as me and talking to her between commercials made me feel like she was in the same room with me. Even if it was in my head. I like that memory."
While You Were Sleeping,I honestly don’t miss it. It was so inconvenient and I would often miss episodes.
While You Were Sleeping,"Yes, and talking with friends about the show the next day."
While You Were Sleeping,I have cable and i still like flipping the channels to see what's on.  I like to watch sports live and when i'm not that's when i'm usually flipping lol.  I'd watch American Idol live too in its Fox heyday because i know if I didn't it would be spoiled all over the place.
While You Were Sleeping,"It's more than just that, though that is a ""feature"" of the current information landscape.

Better or worse, we all now *choose* what to watch and, by extension, believe.  In the ""olden days"" we did indeed revolve around many cultural milestones.

Nowdays, the ""choice"" is basically to watch or not to watch.  That's fine, as far as it goes, but... the choice is really an illusion.  If you don't partake, then you have no say, and the increasingly limited choices means that you are frelled no matter what you do."
While You Were Sleeping,"I remember turning on the TV back in the day and being surprised that a marathon of “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” episodes was on. That feeling of suddenly having your evening’s viewing sorted out was cool. Sometimes it was like a light shining through the possibility of a boring night of channel surfing, to put it as melodramatically as possible."
While You Were Sleeping,Just… watch episodes of shows as they premiere?
While You Were Sleeping,"don't miss it at all. you missed one episode because you couldn't make it to the time it was on and the story made no sense in the next one.

i also like to be able to watch things in my own time, and not when a tv channel decides people should watch it"
While You Were Sleeping,"I don't miss having to try to catch old movies or reruns on syndication at all personally. It was so inconvenient. If I ever had something else going on or was tired, I just plain missed out on something. DVR / streaming is way better.

I do miss the conversation that came with everyone watching new shows at the same time though. That still happens with some shows but Netflix shows in particular are so hard to discuss with friends. No one is ever on the same schedule."
While You Were Sleeping,"I miss just flipping channels. Pre-digital where it didn’t take 2 seconds to load each one, so you could go through 20 channels in 10 seconds if you wanted to

Sometimes it was nice to not know what you want to watch and just flip around until you find something “good enough.”

Having to make a conscious decision of what to watch when there are so many choices can sometimes be more mental effort than I care to expend."
While You Were Sleeping,"Some mourne the death of ""tv monoculture."" There was something special about knowing you were experiencing that new show at roughly the same moment as everyone else.

Choice and interactivity in our entertainment experiences have really reshaped the world, though. Hard to see it as a bad tradeoff."
While You Were Sleeping,"I remember recording ""Headbanger's Ball"" on MTV back in the 90s so I wouldn't miss my favorite metal bands that didn't have their videos played during the day."
While You Were Sleeping,Don't miss it at all. If we could see how the future would be back then we'd be pining for it hard.
While You Were Sleeping,"I guess with me it’s that I sometimes don’t want to devote the time to watch sone things. Whereas when you HAD to watch, you just watched"
While You Were Sleeping,So before VCRs?
While You Were Sleeping,I HATED THAT SO MUCH!! I don’t miss it at all. There’s always PlutoTV that just has stuff on all day if you want it.
While You Were Sleeping,I miss black and white TV I used to watch at my Grandads.
While You Were Sleeping,Even Mister Rogers was a fan of taping shows. I don't miss it in the slightest
While You Were Sleeping,"I got a TiVo on the first day it was available. The person who answered me at the cable company didn't know what it was so I had to explain it to make an order. I felt like it significantly upgraded my quality of life so I wasn't a fan of ""the good old days""."
While You Were Sleeping,"Like everyone else, I don't miss this at all.  The only thing that's sucky (which to be fair was the same before)  is that outside the US, sometimes certain streaming services aren't available in your country so you kind of have to wait and see if any local distributors pick it up. The big difference with the shows we missed for the same reason before, was that now you're a lot more aware of shows because of how viral they get. And of course, most TV shows were just ok. Not as many gems like the ones that have come out of the last decade or so."
While You Were Sleeping,"My dad worked in video when I was a kid and we always had multiple ""broken"" VCRs around so they'd tape multiple shows and watch them later, I remember fixing up a vcr when I was like 11 and got to tape my own stuff. Promptly filled a dresser drawer with HBO movies and fourth doctor Doctor Who episodes."
While You Were Sleeping,I miss the days of late night channel surfing and finding a gem.
While You Were Sleeping,"Agree 100%. If I can watch something WHENEVER I want, it'll end up in the ""I have so many things to catch up on"" pile.  However, if I have to be in front of the TV at 7pm on Wednesday or I miss the show, I'll make time and enjoy the anticipation of ""catching"" my show."
While You Were Sleeping,Do you miss that or are you just looking at it with Rose tinted glasses just because you miss that time period of your life?
While You Were Sleeping,Not sure why you would miss it. There are still literally hundreds of regular TV channels and a bunch of streaming services that offer the linear experience.
While You Were Sleeping,"I don’t. You would have to set up your day around the time your cartoon or tv show gets broadcasted and if it was at a time you were not home you re missing the episode if not the whole show. 

Plus the episodes were not necessarily in order, sometimes you only get half a season, sometimes you will never finish the show because the channel didn’t buy it but in the country of origin of the show it continued.

Sometimes you watch the exact same episodes because it’s impossible for you to watch the first few seasons or you just keep on missing those you didn’t see 

You were limited to only 3 countries  and seldomly a fourth : US, UK, your own and maybe one other. Almost all dub only. 

And that’s leaving aside commercials or having to watch something you don’t like because there is nothing else to do. 

Truly I only see one positive thing about TV : many episode were disconnected. One episode = one story. Even for adventures etc. You could miss multiple season and you wouldn’t mind. You may even arrive toward the end of the show and it’s okay you will watch the last season and then hopefully the old episode will re-run. 

We were less… feel obligated/compelled to watch from ep1 S1. 

That’s it. That’s the only good thing about TV."
While You Were Sleeping,"People are still watching stuff as immediately as it’s released, people stay up till 3am on weeknights to watch marvel shows then talk about it online, what exactly do you miss?"
While You Were Sleeping,"Not much different, especially since more and more and more and more ads are showing up on these services.  What started as a new and superior way to watch movies and shows has basically diverted to becoming the same thing as cable."
While You Were Sleeping,"I don’t.  



Y’all have some really fucking stupid opinions"
While You Were Sleeping,"Nope, I watch what I want when I want"
While You Were Sleeping,I get it. I love the MCU shows for that. They give you new clues each episode and you have one week to figure it out. :)
While You Were Sleeping,Always thought they would’ve implemented a watch party feature and eventually create something that shows a random movie/series/episode stream which they could’ve used to even push specific releases to get people interested. But I do weirdly miss using the breaks to run to the bathroom and back to not miss anything.
While You Were Sleeping,What is stopping you from staying up late and watching whatever you want? Do you miss people missing their favourite programs?
While You Were Sleeping,"Someone else posted this and its higher lol. But Yes I do miss sitting down on whatever night the show was airing and just watching it, then going to my computer and immedietely going to the subreddit, or the IMDB message boards."
While You Were Sleeping,"That’s how I got sucked into 90 Day Fiancé, which I never would have intentionally watched through streaming."
While You Were Sleeping,My bestie and I did that with a couple of scifi shows in the mid-90s. No one else we knew were interested in them and it was the highlight of the week being able to chat while we waited for the next segment.
While You Were Sleeping,Super inconvenient. When I was 15 I left hanging out with my friends at the mall so I could make it home in time to see the avatar the last airbender season 2 premiere
While You Were Sleeping,"Yeah me either. I can understand the mindset of being excited for the show coming up, but what if you missed the show or had a power outage? You’re just SOL. There’s no way I’d voluntarily go back to that"
While You Were Sleeping,"Some of us mastered the VCR and DVR, so that was never actually an issue. 

Also, my cable (yes, I'm a dinosaur who still has cable) comes with a VoD (video-on-demand), which is a lot like streaming only it doesn't hit my data and I can even sometimes fast-forward through ads. Assuming I'm not watching HBO where there are no ads."
While You Were Sleeping,Dvr
While You Were Sleeping,A lot of streaming services are actually moving back to the weekly release model as it does drive hype and maintain subscribers.
While You Were Sleeping,"> the increasingly limited choices 

If you only stick to ""big"" shows/games/etc. you're limited, sure, but there's more content available even from smaller producers now than there ever was before. It's the more in-the-middle-budget-wise stuff that's really going away, or things made by larger companies but with smaller (perceived) appeal (like how HBO Max recently cut a lot of its animation content, even stuff with devoted fanbases/general praise like Infinity Train). Big companies being less willing to take risks, wanting to rely on more reliable content like established franchises, cheaper unscripted content, etc., but that has less to do with content on demand as it does with market consolidation and the like."
While You Were Sleeping,nowadays we just use playlists

While You Were Sleeping,"i think you can change your screen's settings to monochrome. and if you really want an early days experience, put on the captions and mute it"
While You Were Sleeping,"So do I. That’s the main reason I still prefer cable. Unlike services that are make suggestions based on algorithms, channel surfing allows you to stumble upon a new favorite by accident. There’s no better feeling."
While You Were Sleeping,"It's really only Netflix that does the full season drops.

The standard for every other streamer is weekly releases."
While You Were Sleeping,In apps? How do you do that
While You Were Sleeping,"maybe a thing in america. i don't remember that being a thing in europe. i could record it if i had a vcr. then our cable boxes started coming with a recording feature, but they literally had to have the ads for the cable company on tv explain how to use it, because it's a complicated mess. so a lot of people don't bother with it. my mom in the 2010s was still using a vcr and vhs tapes so she could record her telenovelas and watch them later"

While You Were Sleeping,"Just the overall story arc in general where Deb wants to fuck Dexter, but especially the part where her therapist tells her to go for it."
While You Were Sleeping,"The last season of Killing Eve became unwatchable for me, I didn’t finish it so I have no idea how the show ended.  The first season was phenomenal, I loved the premise, loved the acting, the fashion, the cinematography of the locations they shot in, the soundtrack, everything about the show drew me in and kept me in suspense.  Second season was equally good and kept me interested because the plot continued to move forward and the characters continued to develop.  

Third season lost some steam and the story lines became more convoluted.  I liked the concept that Villanelle was becoming burnt out on killing people and possibly wanted something different for her life and the question was, is she capable of leading a normal life if she’s a psychopath.  I also wanted to see how her obsession with Eve was going to play out.  

The last season with the constant battle back and forth of “will they or won’t they” with Eve and Villanelle, introducing new characters that muddied the story lines, Villanelle suddenly embracing religion, etc., so many tedious additional plot lines took me out of the story and made me lose interest.  The actual scene that made me give up on the show was when Villanelle went on some camping retreat with a church group and she was in her tent, hallucinating and seeing another version of herself as Jesus Christ.  She was talking to herself, having all these visions and I couldn’t tell if the Jesus version of her was supposed to be an antagonist or a voice of reason.  I just thought it was a weird direction to take the show and I didn’t like it.  They lost me after that."

While You Were Sleeping,"There's an episode of New Girl, which is generally a pretty fun and well written show, where the main character Jess straight up stalks an ex boyfriend who has a restraining order on her. Jess always has boundary issues so I thought okay maybe they'll use this to teach her a lesson, do some character growth. Nope, the way it's written just makes it seem cute and quirky she is stalking her ex and hiding in the back of his truck! Worst part? At the end of the episode, the ex professes he still has feelings for her and the restraining order was just there because else he couldn't make himself stay away from her, and they get back together.

I'm not generally a fan of this argument but it's one of the few times where I say that if you genderswap those involved, this would be a horror episode. Jess is straight up creepy obsessed here and it's all written as if it's just her being her quirky self. No, it's fucking horifying."

There's no agreement on how to get inflation under control however increasing unemployment will be devastating to many families.   Fuck those people, amirighr?"

The Secret Life of My Secretary,larry summers was so smug when corporation profits is a huge contributor to inflation is somehow a non factor. Fuck this guy.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"This guy embodies everything wrong with the economic system of the last decades. Its appalling to watch him talk with such disregard for truth. 

And why shouldn't he? He has gotten away with it so far, treating the working masses like cows while he and his billionaire friends, the shepherds, are guiding us all to a brighter future as is their god given right for being so much better, so much more competent, intelligent and hard working than the rest of us. 

This man is a cancer. And the fact that he has been in leading positions in the highest echelons of government, education and economic policy for decades, is the clearest sign that the system was broken, is broken, and will remain broken unless we, the working masses, do something about it."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,Larry Summers is the embodiment of neoliberalism and all of its ills.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Anyone have any idea what Stewart's sources are here? Stewart makes this claim:

> The San Francisco Fed says, that is, demand is maybe 30 to 35 percent of the inflation, wages are really around 20 percent of the inflation. There's a huge corporate profit aspect to it, there's a huge supply chain aspect to it. But our method for controlling it seems really much more focused on wages and employment.

I was searching for a while, but the only thing I could find from the San Francisco Fed [was this letter](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2022/june/how-much-do-supply-and-demand-drive-inflation/), but which mentions demand being responsible for a third of inflation but doesn't give any number for wages, and doesn't claim corporate profits are a reason at all.

Also, Stewart's attitude on interest rates is contradictory. When Summers says that some people think we shouldn't have had low interest rates so much in response to the recession, Stewart excitedly agrees with that point. But just a few minutes later Stewart is extremely opposed to getting rid of low rates, because he says it will hurt workers."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,It is with complete lack of surprise that Summers says employees should seek a wage as high as they can get and NOT that companies should pay a wage commensurate with the value that is being produced. Somehow disconnecting the value of the company's good and/or service which is rising with the demand and the value of the people producing said good and/or service. He somehow believes that increase in profit is solely the domain of the  company and it's executive management simply because they can.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,No mention of Summers’ affiliation with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein - post conviction. Yikes.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Stewart is really out of his element here tbh. Summers was right about inflationary fiscal/monetary policy in early 2021 and he’s mostly right here about the so-called “greedflation” though he could communicate it better. 

Stewart’s retort that he would call himself negotiating a higher tv show host salary “gouging” is a serious error that Summers doesn’t unpack. 

Corporate profits/greed have little relationship with inflation rate (see the 1980s for a dramatic inverse correlation). 

Stewart has brought on progressive (I mean Summers is hardly right-wing) economists before like Goolsbee, I would be interested in him bringing in any on his podcast/show to see their view on the matter."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Stewart has a very predictable method with his interviews. If he agrees with you, he does them in person, unedited, with an audience (see all his panels on his new show where they  and the audience all agree with each other)

If he doesn't like you and plans to jam you up, it's prerecorded. He will take hours of interview footage and only air a few minutes of it, to cast his subject in the worst possible light. Many of his subjects complain about this. He doesn't post the unedited interviews anywhere. And his fans are in awe with how clever Stewart is and how he always seems to nail his interview subjects. Almost as if it was edited to come off that way. 

Usually he finds some 2nd rate politician (Summers would be an exception) to beat up on who either doesn't know his tactics or doesn't care and wants the publicity."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Should take the time to watch The Power of The Fed from frontline. Great doc. 

https://youtu.be/9RbL8lTsITY"
The Secret Life of My Secretary,People want to celebrate Obama as some vanguard of the left but this guy (Larry Summers) is the guy who Obama chose to lead his National Economic Council.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Summers is a believer in the wage-price spiral, and that theory has likely gained more traction in economic and political circles as inflation has proven to be stickier than anticipated in the last two years. Sticky high inflation brings up uncomfortable memories of stagflation for older policymakers, so to them, inducing a recession, which is deflationary, is a better option than going through another decade of stagflation. This is a relevant and telling quote about his mindset on this issue from a Feb. 2023 interview with Fareed Zakaria:

>The benefit we can get from pushing unemployment low is on almost all economic theories and likely not to be a permanent one. But if we push inflation up and those issues become entrenched, we're going to live with that inflation for a long time.

To that end, he supports the Fed's rapid increase in interest rates, though the Fed itself is trying to do a ""soft landing"" -- cooling down the economy while avoiding a recession. In this sense, Summers and Powell (chairman of the Fed) are somewhat at odds, as Powell is more optimistic, at least publicly, about a soft landing while Summers is pessimistic.

FWIW, Summers made that speech about higher unemployment (6% for 5 years, 7.5% for 2 years, or 10% for 1 year) in June 2022, when the 12-month percentage change for inflation was peaking at +9.1% despite the freight rate for containers declining. That was around the time when people started fearing that inflation was not as simple as reducing supply-side bottlenecks. Since then, that figure has steadily fallen every month (currently 6%), and he has also moderated his opinion as new positive data has rolled in. During that same Feb. 2023 interview with Zakaria, he admitted that it ""looks more possible that we'll have a soft landing than it did a few months ago."""
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Unemployment jumping all the way to match the highest levels of the Great Recession? With no other economic consequences - like, say, a Greater Recession? Is he an idiot?"
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"No, there’s the beautiful part.  When wintertime rolls around, the ~~gorillas~~ poors simply freeze to death."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,People like Larry Summers won't be happy until the average American has the same standard of living as a Bangladeshi peasant.

The Secret Life of My Secretary,Easy pickins' for Jon 😎
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"It's hilarious that Summers thinks his Apple comments are some big ""Gotcha"" and Jon turns it right around on him lol."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,That's what being surrounded by sycophants and potato-brains does to a motherfucker.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"its more like, the first thing in the 09 recession was how do we save the companies and lowering interest rates sustain the stock market while many people lost their jobs, houses, etc. 

Now with high inflation, the government is coming at it with the 1k to everyone somehow caused 50-90% inflation all while wages have been stagnant for decades so we should up the interest rates which will cause unemployment. WHILE corporations are using it as an excuse to bump up margins with no accountability. its not the interest rates since its just a tool its why are we always using employment and wages when its been such a low factor vs. corporations, profit that benefits/utilize the most for inflation. Basically PPP 1 billion vs. everyone else 1M oh it must be the everyone else fault."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,I think Stewart was speculating there. I agree with him though. It isn't all one thing.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"I think the biggest issue is that this argument conflates two somewhat separate issues:  inflation and corporate profit maximization.  What Stewart is trying to say is that during this inflationary period corporates took advantage of the climate to raise their prices, not to meet inflationary Pareto efficiency, but above and beyond that…to reap additional gains.  He doesn’t land that plane though, and Summers tries to tease the two issues apart.  So this whole thing is basically like they are speaking two different languages.  Frustrating and not one of the better Stewart take-downs IMO."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,You're out of your element. Austin Goolsbee is not a progressive. See his work for Obama to build demand for cutting Social Security.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"> Many of his subjects complain about this. 

Got an example?"
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"He's certainly not an idiot, he's an economist - no compassion or empathy."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,But he'll tsk-tsk about it so there's that.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Yes. He's one of those ""isn't it sad"" types."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"> its more like, the first thing in the 09 recession was how do we save the companies and lowering interest rates sustain the stock market while many people lost their jobs, houses, etc.

> Now with high inflation, the government is coming at it with the 1k to everyone somehow caused 50-90% inflation all while wages have been stagnant for decades so we should up the interest rates which will cause unemployment.

Lower interest rates in general stimulate the economy - jobs, stock market, profits, etc., while higher rates in general do the opposite (lower job, the stock market, profits in the short term). Anyone who wants to be intellectually consistent can't just ignore the benefit to the jobs market talking about the low interest rates in '09, or ignore the benefit to the stock market and profits when talking about current rates.

If anything, the negative effects from the recent rate hikes seem to have hit the stock market and corporate profits earlier than they've hit the labor market."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"They're not really separate issues though.  That's the point.  The core of inflation is the price of the same basket of goods becoming more expensive.  Businesses took advantage of the crisis of the pandemic that people were expecting some things to go up some, to just across the board increase prices on everything way more than ""necessary"", and then not increase the wages they were paying to produce those goods, and then bragging about the profits.  And while there's been no action to address that, the talk in economic circles is purely focusing on the idea that hurting workers more, so they don't have any leverage to ask for more money to keep up with the prices, so that would force the inflation to stop when people can't afford goods.  Which is incredibly fucked up."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"They were both talking past each other and just trying to get ""gotchas"" with each other. Summers was trying to get Jon to bow to his Apple overlords and obviously Jon wouldn't. 

If Summers really wanted to hammer his point through, he should've asked the most easiest way to lower Apple product prices. And that's to decrease demand."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Right, and Obama is totally far-right in europe and so on.

Goolsbee also is more sympathetic to Jon’s argument with regards fo corporate concentration having an effect on inflation, so it would be interesting to hear an actual substantive case for it rather than corporations bad. Summers’s point at the beginning of the interview (Corporations didn’t wake up after 40 years and decide to be greedy) is hard to counter."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,He's also an idiot because the economic impact of 1 out of every 10 Americans out of work would be far greater than any impacts it had on inflation...
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Right, he's probably got the theory correct here.

But in borrowing the wise words of the great The Dude, ""You're not wrong Mr. Summers, you're just an asshole..."""
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"I remember in the late 90s people said things like 'unemployment is dangerously low'. I always wanted to punch those people. 

Of course, for any position you can take there is an economist out there who will agree with you. And usually they are neither 100% right nor 100% wrong. The economy is a complicated thing with many variables.

But yeah, Summers kind of has his head up his ass here."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"There is a difference between low rates and the ultra low rates. Rates should def have been lowered after 2008, but the level of cuts is what's being disputed. 

His point still stands though that inflation is more supply-side than demand-side. This has been echoed by plenty of research houses and the Fed is purely focused on addressing the demand side. Summers doesn't even entertain the notion there there are other ways to also address this like price caps.

That point about free market for corporates but not for workers really drives home his point."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Well they’re not separate issues because the fed and the government’s economists, along with corporations have fucked with the whole underlying equation.  Inflation on its own isn’t a problem.  The theory suggests that prices may increase, but it has to be for a *reason* (or a basket of reasons).  Inputs are more rare, demand went up, labor costs more, etc.  “But we just want more profits” is not a valid reason for inflation per an efficient markets theory.  In an efficient market all profits are already maximized and there is no dead weight loss.  I.e.  the issue isn’t inflation itself, it’s that these corporate jerkoffs and the fed economists hide behind the efficient markets theory when it suits them (like how they explain their interventions to fight inflation) and then distance themselves from it when it doesn’t (like when anyone brings up corporate greed).

The most interesting part of the interview for me was Stewart comparing pricing products to pricing labor. He was onto something there and it seems like maybe they edited that part of the conversation."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"It's not *just* that they're using the double-speak of efficient markets only when its convenient, its also that they're specifically doing it to talk indirectly about who they're directly targeting for pain.  Both of them are why this issue is frustrating to watch people defend exactly why the Fed is raising rates now.  But you see just the slightest flash of the latter being illuminated right as the clip ends, but even when as Summers is forced to acknowledge that, he tries to still play it down and walk it back.   Some of you may die/lose your livelihood, but that's a sacrifice Summers and his friends are willing to make."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"All this moral pontificating ignores that people like yourself or Jon (or sen Warren quite frankly) have no real attainable solution to inflation as opposed to rate rises that will have a credible effect on inflation, so they retreat to conspiratorial nonsense. Summers doesn’t get up in the morning seeking to raise unemployment, he’s a partisan Democrat."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"It depends on what you define as ""attainable"".  Raising tax rates, both on personal income of high-earners and of corporation, will also have a pretty direct effect on inflation.  As will throwing the Justice Dept at the problem of trust-busting.   But Larry and his orbit obviously would rather no one talk about that side of it, so he does everything possible, as showcased in this interview, to brush that off as ""unrealistic"" or ""not the real problem"" and ignore it, even when directly questioned."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Larry has advocated for raising  corporate taxes.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-22/summers-says-raise-taxes-right-now-to-help-battle-inflation


I’m skeptical that trust busting or corporate concentration is an effective tool tbh. Inflation is a global problem that is effecting all industries and I don’t see compelling evidence that corporations are leading it. It’s normal for yoy profit margins to look higher in a year of dramatic economic recovery and rising inflation"

The Secret Life of My Secretary,"That fucking sucks, the 3rd season was where character arcs were finally established and the narrative was reaching a really cool point. Fuck I wish Adult Swim could save this series because it would be perfect for that platform."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,This is why we need piracy.
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"Olan is the kindest, hardest working person I've ever come across, and life is absolutely fucking shitting on him lately. I would do anything to support him."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"I'm not a fan of Roger's ""no no no, it's cringe on purpose"" style of comedy, but I tolerated final space and enjoyed David Tennant's performance.

Annoying that it was cancelled."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"So they didn’t even let the series finish, and now they are screwing Olan over again?"
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"I don't get WBD's end goal here at this point? Screwing over the creatives is going to make them less likely to want to work with you. As a consumer I am way less inclined to subscribe to any service they offer since products they offer can just get deleted permanently with no legal alternative (and it sucks that they are screwing over their employees).

Like sure they will have millions still watching who either don't know about this or don't care, but long term this can not be healthy for the company."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"It's a problem with the digital age. If you don't have physical copies then the studio/service can take it away from you even if you paid for it. But hey, as long as it's convenient then people will buy it again and again. Data caps, cool, most of the services are owned by the ISPs, so win win."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,[olan is quite peeved](https://youtu.be/NAhNBr2Wytk)
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"If it's actually gone (or soon to be) and the IP owners have cancelled it, then wouldn't that make it okay to pirate ? No one's losing money, there's no product to be sold anymore, so no one loses. Rogers and the creative team would, I think, be happy that the show is still being watched and attracting new fans."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,"This is exactly what everyone who's been paying attention has been saying would happen since Batgirl. There's so many people in the comments of the O.G HBO/Warner media articles that are saying that people are overreacting, Batgirl was reportedly bad anyway so who cares, etc....


I expect there to be a lot more write-offs in the future."
The Secret Life of My Secretary,Pirate that shit.  It's the only ethical thing to do
The Secret Life of My Secretary,Such an underrated show too. We need to encourage DVDs & blu-rays even though I prefer streaming just in case they get axed.
Banana Fish,Best April Fools prank from Adult Swim was when they brought back 2003 Toonami for one night which ultimately kickstarted the block's return. 
Banana Fish,My favorite adult swim April fools was when they put mustaches on everyone.  A mustache would be hanging in mid air and eventually a character would line up with it. I'm not sure why it was so funny to me but it still makes me laugh.  
Banana Fish,"Watching American Dad now. In addition to the laugh track, Stan's voice has an echo.

Edit: Holy shit, you guys. It's not just Adult Swim. Teen Titans GO! has been edited so that every character has googly eyes, with proper physics. This one is genuinely hilarious."
Banana Fish,The best Adult Swim April Fools ever was the time they added farts to that episode of Ghost in the Shell. It was just so perfectly timed. I wish I had recorded it somehow.
Banana Fish,I can't believe I missed the Bob's Burgers one 
Banana Fish,Holy fucking balls its annoying both regular cn and hd has weird voice changers where i cant understand characters and laugh tracks in the background.
Banana Fish,"12oz mouse has techno music playing throughout
"
Banana Fish,"Yeah I'm watching bobs burgers. It's fkn annoying. I had to change it. Terrible laugh track it terrible. How is this a prank? It's not cleaver or thoughtful, just annoying. I had to change the channel. "
Banana Fish,"They will cherry it with MDE World Peace s2e1 out of nowhere


jk heh"
Banana Fish,[deleted]
Banana Fish,The first and funniest one I remember was when they just added fart sounds to all their shows. I was watching FMA and thought I must have misremembered the humor in the show.
Banana Fish,"The year they ran a marathon of Perfect Hair Forever with fansubs is my favorite, at least that earned some geniune hard laughs"
Banana Fish,"was it just me or did it make the scene with the 200 way better. 
also the whole story telling aspect of that episode works oddly well with it. "
Banana Fish,"I know, they both sound amazing
"
Banana Fish,Yep. This was funny for a couple minutes but that was enough.
Banana Fish,The one I remember was 10 years ago where it was constant fart and shit sounds over an episode of Fullmetal Alchemist. 
Banana Fish,Adult Swim wouldn't mess with Toonami. Samurai Jack and Dragon Ball Super are their money makers right now. 
Banana Fish,This was the best one.
Banana Fish,I hope it was a really dramatic episode 
Wok of Love,The prick turned up to court each day in a rented Rolls Royce. Not really sure what the message he was trying to make was.
Wok of Love,Gonna chime in on this one and say I have no idea how the people of Britain let this guy fucking win during his season. Like there were absolute pieces of garbage that season and he stood out the most. The show even allowed his now ex-gf to break up with him IN THE HOUSE on an episode after he had sex with another contestant LMAO.
Wok of Love,People are so stupid.
Wok of Love,I read that he made 40k from his OF around the time he posted the video. I hope he has to pay her every cent of it.
Wok of Love,Good. What a POS.
Wok of Love,[Every time I see this fuckwit I remember him shitting his pants in big brother when that giant opened the door.](https://youtu.be/-dJ-fRGSTEQ)
Wok of Love,What a gross thing to do.
Wok of Love,Holy fucking loser Batman
Wok of Love,"Saw him on 2 seasons of The Challenge and it was obvious he was a major asshole. He had some fun moments but he didn't know when to stop and took things too far.

It was rough watching some of the girls fall for his ""bad boy"" charm over and over (specifically Georgia and Kailah). 

In retrospect that scene where Wes and Bananas stuck a photo of Kailah's boyfriend up above her bed was probably a low-key effort to remind her she was about to cheat on her boyfriend for an absolute prick."
Wok of Love,Celebrity is quite a stretch
Wok of Love,Eww. He *drips* douchebag.
Wok of Love,Maybe Channel 4 can stick a camera up his arse so we don’t miss any of the action.
Wok of Love,"Not Georgia! She is so lovely 🥺 

...And even if she wasn't, no one should ever suffer this humiliation or invasion of privacy. The court ruled appropriately."
Wok of Love,I hate everything about this headline.
Wok of Love,"I have never seen this person, so I guess even winning Celebrity Big Brother doesn't make someone much of a celebrity."
Wok of Love,These guys trying too hard to prove their masculinity. What a joke.
Wok of Love,Good. Fucking loser
Wok of Love,I had to read that headline nine times before I stopped seeing George Harrison.
Wok of Love,Who and who?
Wok of Love,"Not long enough considering this dickhead's given her a life sentence, knowing that video will be online forever now because of him. Hope he's put on the sex offender register for life."
Wok of Love,Oh what a miserable fucking cunt this dude is. I hate him so much. He’s a true monster.
Wok of Love,"It’s crazy this shit stain got 21 months for posting a fucking video, versus that mega shit stain QB who only got 6 months for beating the shit out of his gf. It’s a very backwards, fucked up system we got"
Wok of Love,"For context, he will only serve half of this sentence and be on some bullshit probation for the remainder."
Wok of Love,"Not long enough IMHO, arrogant prick."
Wok of Love,Never heard of him.
Wok of Love,"If he’s put on the sex offenders register, will he banned from travel and social media? I really hope so would be nice for him to disappear from consciousness. 

Oh, and I hope prison is thoroughly unpleasant for him. But he’ll probably be protected on the nonce wing."
Wok of Love,As he should. If not more…
Wok of Love,Oh my god that’s terrible.  Which website was it?
Wok of Love,[removed]
Wok of Love,"Isnt this how the kardashians got their start? They just did it in a sneaky “oops, it got leaked” way."
Wok of Love,Nasty bastard
Wok of Love,What's really sad is if you watch the video of him showing up for sentencing there was still loads of girls wanting pictures with him
Wok of Love,"Disappointed that he turned out to be an actual prick. For what I saw when he appeared in those reality shows my GF watches, he was pretty hilarious. Managed to rub everyone the wrong way. Especially those idiots of the MTV Challenge shows who take themselves way too serious. But fuck him for putting this video online and he got what he deserves"
Wok of Love,"She looks like a Smut anyway, should have never made a video knowing it could get out."
Wok of Love,Link?
Wok of Love,Maybe don’t allow yourself to be videotaped for sex?
Wok of Love,Lame.
Wok of Love,Remindme! 2 hours
Wok of Love,20000 channels here
Wok of Love,"This is so stupid. Yes if somebody is murderer, robber, rapist, etc.. send them to prison. But this? Wtf this world is so soft lmao"
Wok of Love,"If two adults consent to recording themselves having sex, you pretty much give up any right to privacy given the risks involved of that video being made public."
Wok of Love,*Sigh*
Wok of Love,Money often brings out the trash that was hidden within. Hope he enjoys his three hots and a cot.
Wok of Love,See ya
Wok of Love,Loozah!
Wok of Love,Showing off the dick again. Some guys can’t help themselves.
Wok of Love,Good
Wok of Love,"Surely that should be ‘celebrity’ Big Brother. Seriously though, why do we keep enabling biological waste like this numpty?"
Wok of Love,"How about we change the narrative on this:
""Convicted sex offender Stephen Bear sentenced to 21 Months......"""
Wok of Love,Dick head. Off to jail. Fker
Wok of Love,What a douche.
Wok of Love,"I remember him watching the, “The Challenge”. I never liked him and always rooted against him"
Wok of Love,"Wait, I'm confused. His only noticeable claim to fame is being on Celebrity Big Brother? Wouldn't that mean he wasn't a celebrity? How the fuck did that happen?"
Wok of Love,"every brother is big in prison…

have fun."
Wok of Love,Whoa that’s awesome. I remember when people would literally post videos of themselves having sex with a minor unbeknownst to the other party the other party would be the one that got dragged and everyone else celebrated the poster. Happened to Paris Hilton.
Wok of Love,Picture checks out
Wok of Love,Disgusteng
Wok of Love,Neck tattoos…
Wok of Love,"What kind of asshols does that?  Just because they have a typical hot attributes of man, doesn't mean this! What a prick."
Wok of Love,Who is this guy and why is he well known enough to be considered a “celebrity?”
Wok of Love,Is *everybody* on Big Brother a steaming pile of shit?
Wok of Love,Both of them are a waste of space
Wok of Love,And he published non-consensual photos and videos with his ex. So well deserved!
Wok of Love,A smart rich person would go to rehab and blame it all in the demon liquor
Wok of Love,"“I’m terribly insecure, please feel jealous of me”"
Wok of Love,Maybe he was trying to make sure that every single person who saw him loathed him. The crime itself probably was enough but he could have wanted the extra assurance.
Wok of Love,Trying to be an Andrew Tate alpha dude bro? Because apparently doing sex crimes is fine as long as you own luxury cars
Wok of Love,He’s probably a big Andrew Tate fan
Wok of Love,"Must have been trying to let everyone know what a massive cunt he is, as if his previous actions hadn’t already proven it to anyone watching. Not that I condone anything bad happening to him but maybe going to prison as a sex offender will show him the error of his ways, although being a high profile prisoner will probably afford him more luxuries than the average person would receive"
Wok of Love,How do you know it was rented
Wok of Love,Imagine the type of people who watch celebrity big brother and I’m sure you’ll find your answer
Wok of Love,"People vote for the people they want to see more of next week. It's visual clickbait that ends up winning, not because we like these people, but because we like to judge them. 

So this weird symbiotic relationship exists where assholes try and be mega-assholes just to keep the eyeballs glued to their antics. And the viewers get what they want just the same. 

My word for 2023 is ""disengage"". Really I shouldn't even be reading a reddit thread about the guy, it is absolutely what he wants and will perpetuate this sort of personality proliferating."
Wok of Love,"Many idiots think of people like him as ""alpha males"" unironically... they think they are ""powerful"" and ""real men"" and other shit like that, since they believe themselves to be like that or worse, wish they would be like that, and thats why they vote for that.

Then you have some women that like ""bad boys"" i.e. assholes they think they can ""tame"", when we all know assholes will stay assholes....

Thats sadly how most of reality TV works, the biggest dicks and assholes always win, women and men.

I mean look at Francesca WhatsHerName from Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, she won, when she was not only clearly there for Clout only, but basically fucked over everyone, was a total bitch and basically sold herself for some internet fame... and she still has a huge following because there are too many idiots and lowlifes that love people like that as described above... people are insane."
Wok of Love,"In Australia when it first started the person who usually wins is just a genuine compassionate down to earth person with empathy.

Most have had good positive careers after it and in talk shows and are just good people.

How the fuck do these cunts keep winning now? Is that what people inspire to be like now?"
Wok of Love,"Well, this is the same show that produced Andrew Tate, so…"
Wok of Love,"Didn't watch celebrity big brother but did see him on The Challenge.

He came across as a ""douche with a heart""  

* He would cheat, but be honest that he cheated and show some remorse

* he would lie, but show some remorse for the lie

* he would act tough, but talk about it being a front

* (not a big brother thing but in the challenge he had a string never quite attitude even against much bigger people that made him popular)

On the challenge he played up a character  pretty well.  The bad boy with a heart of gold.  People eat that shit up.

The girl in the video met him on the challenge and ate that shit up.  People love an asshole who looks to have a soft center"
Wok of Love,None of these shows are chosen by the public. It is all decided by marketing and money.
Wok of Love,"This entire genre of media is fucking appalling trash, that's how. Its fans are just as awful."
Wok of Love,Area you trying to rationalize reality TV? Go touch some grass
Wok of Love,People are so ~~stupid.~~ horrible
Wok of Love,Which beckons the question why we’re giving them more publicity
Wok of Love,He’ll probably be paying that in legal fees.
Wok of Love,Holy shit that guy is huge
Wok of Love,I don't understand anything that happened in this video
Wok of Love,The narcissistic wound in public format
Wok of Love,Lol! Just watched that. What a fucking pussy.
Wok of Love,"Ironically, after all his attempts at appearing Alpha, he looks just like David in Schitt’s Creek.

“Eeew, David.”"
Wok of Love,The Challenge is the show I know him from. Wes and Bananas teaming up for that was hilarious.
Wok of Love,"Ahhhh

Bear from the challenge....

He was fun on the challenge but being a douche on that show won't make you stand out. Pretty much all of them are douches

Him being a little guy who fought with a ton of heart is what got him fans."
Wok of Love,"I haven't got to this season yet, but I've seen Kailah and I hate hearing this. She's someone I hate due to a lot of her actions, but she's so pretty in exactly the way I like with dark hair and tats."
Wok of Love,"In the UK he sadly is. This trial was constantly reported on by our tabloids and even the BBC. 

This guy is a scumbag and should absolutely have no celebrity following, but some people live for following this stuff. See also Chris Brown still selling out tours."
Wok of Love,"The great natural culmination of Big Brother (the UK version anyway) was the blurring of the lines between celebrity and non celebrity Big Brother.   
     
When it started back in the late 90s, it was just some people in a house and you watched them on TV. It was the only reality TV there was. Pre-Facebook world, any ‘social media’ that existed was just bored teenagers listing their favorite bands.       
Then the celebrity one was a charity version of ‘all in a house’ only it was people who were known to the public due to being high profile in some form of entertainment (music, acting, sport, comedy, etc.).       
       
Slowly people started to realise that success on reality TV could be the gateway to ‘a career in being famous’ and being on other TV, so more and more people were less ‘just in a house’ and more trying to achieve notoriety as a springboard to fame.     
And in the celebrity one it became seen as about tacky famewhores and associated with being ‘washed up’, so they were increasingly scraping the barrel of who was ‘famous’.    
The original meta-culmination of this was when they had a non-celebrity-pretending-to-be-a-c-list-celebrity on celebrity Big Brother, which then naturally made her a celebrity.    
       
But then the third act topped it, as social media became more universal and challenged broadcast TV in importance.      
Now you still have attractive young people who want to be famous (aka the people that go on Big Brother), but if they are serious enough about that to be a good Big Brother contestant, they already have a set of high profile social media accounts with many followers unrelated to their real life. They also likely also interact with similar social media personalities (and date similar) so they can all put it on their social media, etc. They’re already ‘scene’ if they’re hungry and importantly attractive enough to become scene, and therefore celebrities.    
       
So by the end both celebrity and non-celebrity versions was an indistinguishable collection of hot 20 something’s who had already got off with each other for likes and ad revenue on various media platforms. Only the celeb version would also have a washed up American star with poor mental health who needed the money for legal issues thrown in to interact with them.      
     
That’s the point that it became clear ‘the kids’ make their own reality-fame these days and it was pointless to broadcast people who constantly broadcast themselves.       
       
Big Brother became a perfect window onto the changing nature of fame."
Wok of Love,"Ohhhh he posted Georgia...from the challenge

They were both fun to watch on the challenge.

(Yes total douche but everyone is a douche or recovering douche on the challenge. It's part of what makes the eliminations so fun)"
Wok of Love,"Hilariously, I’m pretty sure that the contestants are supposed to be celebrities before joining the show (that is, they aren’t becoming celebrities because of the show, they are supposed to already be famous). 

Of course, there’s no way to get a genuine celebrity with a real career to agree to do something like this, so the casting people have to go with a bunch of nobodies anyway. Checking Wikipedia, the people who were on that season are mostly from other reality shows for example."
Wok of Love,"The genre is circular. You are famous by being on reality TV and that feeds back in to the celeb side of reality TV. It just eats itself because no one else wants anything to do with it, because its beyond useless trash."
Wok of Love,"Just hoping this wasn't America's version of Celebrity Big Brother, which only ran opposite the Winter Olympics."
Wok of Love,"I saw him on the challenge.  Charismatic douche

Fit in well on the challenge as they are pretty much all douches or recovering douches."
Wok of Love,"I mean, his onlyfans and twitter is full of videos of him sitting on a huge dildo and fucking himself with objects. Can’t be more masculine than that!"
Wok of Love,I can't find it
Wok of Love,"If he posted it on his only fans, then it's not public so no it won't be online forever"
The Last Empress,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Last Empress,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Last Empress,[removed]
The Last Empress,[removed]
The Last Empress," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Last Empress,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Last Empress,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Last Empress,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Last Empress,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Last Empress,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Last Empress,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Last Empress,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Last Empress,Rat King is coming
The Last Empress,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Last Empress,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Last Empress,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Last Empress,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Last Empress,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Last Empress,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Last Empress,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Last Empress,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Last Empress,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Last Empress,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Last Empress,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Last Empress,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Last Empress,[removed]
The Last Empress,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Last Empress,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Last Empress,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Last Empress,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Last Empress,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Last Empress,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Last Empress,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Last Empress,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Last Empress,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Last Empress,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Last Empress,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Last Empress,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Last Empress,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Last Empress,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Last Empress,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Last Empress,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Last Empress,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Last Empress,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Last Empress,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Last Empress,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Last Empress,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Last Empress,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Last Empress,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Last Empress,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Last Empress,[deleted]
The Last Empress,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Last Empress,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Last Empress,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Last Empress,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Last Empress,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Last Empress,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Last Empress,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Last Empress,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Last Empress,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Last Empress,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Last Empress,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Last Empress,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Last Empress,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Last Empress,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Last Empress,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Last Empress,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Last Empress,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Last Empress,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Last Empress,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Last Empress,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Last Empress,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Last Empress,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Last Empress,We gonna get the rat king.
The Last Empress,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Last Empress,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Last Empress,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Last Empress,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Last Empress,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Last Empress,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Last Empress,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Last Empress,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Last Empress,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Last Empress,[removed]
The Last Empress,[removed]
The Last Empress,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Last Empress,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Last Empress,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Last Empress,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Last Empress,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Last Empress,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Last Empress,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Last Empress,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Last Empress,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Last Empress,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Last Empress, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Last Empress,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Last Empress,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Last Empress,And more golfing
The Last Empress,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Still 17,[deleted]
Still 17,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Still 17,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Still 17,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.

Still 17,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Still 17,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Still 17,🙂💕
Still 17,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Still 17,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Still 17,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Still 17,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Still 17,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Still 17,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Still 17,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Still 17,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Still 17,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Still 17,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Still 17,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Still 17,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Still 17,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Still 17,"Honestly there's room for (and great examples of) both shows with an endpoint in mind and shows that are designed to run pretty much forever.

Not a fan of your ""I prefer miniseries so it should become the norm"" attitude."
Still 17,"I think your title is pretty misleading to the post itself (or just clickbait maybe). One season shows with a complete story are great, but the majority of cancellations leave a story incomplete."
Still 17,"You ever heard of this newfangled concept; movies. Sounds like it might be right up your street. 

If that proves too lengthy a commitment there is always TikTok."
Still 17,Being canceled rarely leads to complete endings. Usually just means shows with long plans don't get to do them
Still 17,OP if a story is designed to be only one season and does that- its not cancelled
Still 17,Weird
Still 17,Right.  The problem with Netflix cancellations is that they don't tell a story in a season.  They tell part of a story and then cancel it left undone.
Still 17,I totally agree with you on that...I luv limited series as well
Still 17,"If Netflix is going to stay the course with their parameters for renewal, then every greenlit show has to have a “movie to wrap up the story” or a “each season must end on a potential series finale” clause, because having 50%+ of their catalog being unfinished stories isn’t it."
Still 17,"I really enjoyed Sprung, a comedy from the makers of Raising Hope and My Name Is Earl. The whole thing wrapped up after 9 episodes, but never stated it was a limited series."
Still 17,"Not an attitude, it’s an honest opinion. You’re welcome to your own. Just saying what I prefer and why."
Still 17,"Yes, what people are most frustrated about is the lack of closure, a cancelled tv show is akin to a movie ending in the middle of its runtime and never resuming."
Still 17,"Ahah i guess there is smth for everybody right now, movies, short series, long ones, etc. I don’t understand the need of OP to advocate for one concept to prevail, it would only profit those who like the concept and let the others frustrated…"
Still 17,"Yes that’s true, but I really don’t mind all that much when a show announces a final season, or provided it gets cancelled after it’s next season giving the writers time to create a proper send off. But at the end of the day I’m a completionist by nature and if all the shows I watch get cancelled then it means I have less I’m committed to"
Still 17,The Netflix comment was not meant to be taken seriously
Still 17,I agree with you i like a nice little show with no commitment while I also work through a longer show.
Still 17,"You may wanna specify that then, I like jokes but on a written post it is kinda difficult to tell what’s serious and what’s facetious.

Still 17,"You are utterly right, read in diagonal and missed it, my bad  😞"
Still 17,"No worries, definitely understand why people don’t agree with me tho regardless of the joke"
Still 17,"Well, I do not understand advocating for one type of tv shows to prevail when they can all coexist."

\>20. The themes, “If you kill them, you’re no better than them” 

Oh hell yeah. Especially when not killing them is sometimes much worse. Like if they can't be captured or detained reliably and can be expected to kill more people.

My own ones are

A-Team Firing. Bullets are flying everything at fairly close ranges, but no one is getting hit, or at least none of the named characters. Also when the heroes are being strafed by a chopper or plane and the bullets follow a path to their left and right. And car chases where the hero's car has absorbed its own weight in bullets but no occupants or critical components were hit.

Melee where the fighters are happily trading punches, but as soon as one of them picks up a knife or sword, the other fighter gains a 100% dodge buff.

World-ending stakes. If you set the stakes too high,  the audience won't believe you'll follow through and destroy the world or kill the entire cast. Smaller stakes are better."

3. Cops in a 10-minute firefight in the middle of a crowded public space not having to spend the rest of their career filling out paperwork.
4. People ordering food and/or drinks and never paying for them."
Still 17,Do you even like any tropes? This is an absurdly long list
Still 17,"People getting up apparently two hours before they have to leave in the morning, acting relaxed in the morning instead of everyone rushing out of the house."
Still 17,"1 - cops, doctors or X agents on 45 hours shifts/missions with no sleep at all and still being super quippy, verbose and athletic at the end of it. Yep, sure

2 - men the size of small Zamboni trucks getting carpeted by women whose arms are thinner than Italian breadsticks. Yep, sure

3 - this is also in movies: people walk into the boss' office with a stack sized pile of documents, boss flips the first two pages, makes a ""oh shit"" face and immediately understands everything. Yep, sure"
Still 17,Weird...
Still 17,"The way someone in a restaurant or diner will just throw some money on the table and leave. Is that still a thing in USA? Seems dodgy 

And I absolutely déteste the trope shot of a woman disappearing out of the bottom of the frame whilst the camera stays on the man’s face to film his reaction signifying oral sex. Awful."
Still 17,[deleted]
Still 17,Murder...unless it happens in the last half
Still 17,"* the only canon autistic characters over 18 basically being the kind of archetype Sheldon's a caricature of

* when what's needed to take down a regime in a dystopian series or fulfill some prophecy or w/e on a fantasy series somehow ends up making it so the male and female lead falling in love is key to saving the world

* when it feels like sitcom premises were created from the punny title and then no one bothered to put as much effort into the show"
Still 17,"I can see it being smart as a way to not be caught for their crimes, yeah."
Still 17,I too have wondered why that always happens.
Still 17,"Yep. Gotta love character development, positive or negative!"
Still 17,They’re the worst.
Still 17,?
Still 17,"Ahh, like the village love triangle added to the Wheel of Time TV show, plus the added and killed off wife of Perrin."
Still 17,"Yep. If the hero lets the bad guy go free instead of facing whatever punishment they were due, and more people die as a result, that's on the hero as well."
Still 17,"Some of us do that on purpose, so we don't have to go from zero-to-panic in the morning.  When I worked hourly jobs, I never understood the guys who would rush in thirty seconds before start time and then act like they couldn't understand why I would start the day so much more prepared.  It's like, five minutes, guys, and normal things like ""hanging up your coat"" won't feel like a race against time."
Still 17,">3 - this is also in movies: people walk into the boss' office with a stack sized pile of documents, boss flips the first two pages, makes a ""oh shit"" face and immediately understands everything. Yep, sure

First or second page of a report usually has an executive summary for exactly that reason."
Still 17,What’s weird?
Still 17,"Leaving money on the table and leaving is definitely a thing in Hong Kong, even when sharing the table or booth with other patrons. I've done it in the US, too, and have not seen complaints from my US friends or the servers/managers."
Still 17,Officer making a interview to a child without a parent is not a good idea. And end it is a very good idea.
Still 17,"It's because of practical production issues. It's incredibly impractical to keep re-shooting the same scene over and over and have maybe 3 different scenes in a day where the character eats, if the actors actually eats properly during filming. They'd feel sick (and I guess there could also be inconsistency in scenes if they film it from different sides and half a pancake is missing in one shot but not in the next, et cetera).

I understand this but still can't help but feel annoyed every time I see it. XD"
Still 17,I hate Isotropes on TV. A play on words.
Still 17,"But not the whole family, or teenagers."
Still 17,"So you decide how much you pay or tip? There’s no negotiation and no interaction of getting mmmm receiving change from your k
Total? Seems like you are wasting a lot of money."
Still 17,"I love ""Castle"" but its so fucking blatantly obvious they are ""drinking"" from empty coffee mugs. FFS"
Still 17,Why not? I've been that way all my life. I've known families who were like that.
Still 17,"The servers leave the bill/cheque, expecting you to pay it at your leisure. In Hong Kong, the norm in those shops is to leave the bill immediately after receiving your food -- if not earlier -- or upon request -- ""bill, please!"". One can pay and leave on the table. No tips in Hong Kong. If change is needed, one can wait for a server, or bring directly to the cashier. This is for efficiency: HK restaurants are small; if everyone went to the cashier, there would be a big line that could block flow of traffic. If everyone waited for server, then new clients may not get their orders in, or their food in time, could be a back-up in the kitchen, etc. 

In US where I've lived, many restaurants with this norm will deposit the bill after asking if you will have anything else -- ""Just pay it when you're ready"" -- or upon request. If one is paying with a card, one will need to flag down the staff, of course, but if one has cash, then the total is there; one adds the gratuity to it as desired. Not every restaurant is this way, but those which are seem rather consistently so."

Still 17,I want to be very clear about something. This [award] means absolutely nothing to me.
Still 17,"They're not getting any. It's why ""The Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award"" was written."
Still 17,Reddit moment
Still 17,"They'll never get an award, because they refuse to play the ass-kissing game that's *mandatory* if you want one. 

They literally made an entire episode about it as a big ""fuck you"" to the process and the industry people who run it."
Still 17,He doesn't need your trophies or your gold
Still 17,"Yeah, but when it's all said and done I think the show will go down as the greatest comedy of all time. That means more than any emmy/award to me. I get what you mean though, they absolutely deserve it"
Still 17,"If they wanna win a nomination, they gotta play the game. They been running a show for 10 years with nothing to show for, makes 'em look like a bunch of assholes!"
The Fiery Priest,"Obviously this guy really hams it up for the cameras, but he seems like a stand up dude, trying to help wherever he can!"
The Fiery Priest,That's _Mayor_ Guy Fieri. Respect his title as the duly elected representative of Flavortown
The Fiery Priest,">Tally the long line of show credits and the millions in contributions, and it becomes challenging to reconcile the Fieri of 2021 — emergent folk hero — with the Fieri who first materialized on American TV in April 2006, newly crowned winner of a nascent reality competition (The Next Food Network Star).

Now I imagine people in a wasteland future singing songs and telling stories about the mythical Guy Fieri."
The Fiery Priest,"We locals joke about Santa Rosa being something of a backwater, discount version of Marin Co. But I gotta hand it to Guy, he's made his home town proud and maybe pushed Santa Rosa a little up the totem pole, so to speak."
The Fiery Priest,"After getting into the industry and seeing how almost all of my childhood chef heroes were actually garbage human beings, I cannot praise enough how much Guy is actually a real deal idol that all aspiring cooks, and honestly people, should strive to be more like."
The Fiery Priest,[deleted]
The Fiery Priest,"“By the way, we never heard back from Jeff.”  He fucking torched Bezos in print.  Guy Fieri for president."
The Fiery Priest,My initial judgement of him was based on superficial qualities and I thought he was a phoney (yeah I'm small minded and petty). After a few years I couldn't help but thinking he is one cool motherfucker.
The Fiery Priest,"Dude hit on my mom when I was a kid, but I have a hard time holding a grudge over it with how much shit he's done for people. (Grew up in the same small NorCal town)"
The Fiery Priest,Hilarious dig at Bezos and Amazon!
The Fiery Priest,He led the restaurant relief fund that was available to ANY type of employee in the hospitality business. It was $500 that I desperately needed before the second stimulus came. Thanks Guy!!
The Fiery Priest,"It always has bugged me that people don’t like him simply because how he looks. It’s such a grade school mentality of how to assess someone. IMO anyone saying “I thought he was a douche but realize he’s a good guy by reading shit like this” should re-evaluate how they judge people.

Guy never had to justify he’s a decent person because of how he looks. That perception is on the people making the judgment."
The Fiery Priest,"People give him a lot of shit and make fun of his expressions, shirts, hair but he's uber-successful and is loving life. He's the Nickleback of chefs! :)"
The Fiery Priest,"I like how he’s having a kind of cultural re-emergence. Everyone was making fun of him for being a weirdo and now everyone’s loves him for being an awesome, generous weirdo"
The Fiery Priest,"""Nothing can replace what this kind of recognition, appearing on TV, can do for these people and their businesses … for their lives,"" he says, taking a sip of coffee. ""I need to keep doing this because it just needs to be done.""

Literally my favorite celebrity."
The Fiery Priest,I don’t like his shows very much. But seams like a stand up guy.
The Fiery Priest,"Ten years ago, who would have thoughts guy Fieri was the good guy and bill Cosby was the bad"
The Fiery Priest,What happened to the old rumors about him being a dick to employees on set and being homophobic? That disproven or just too long ago people forgot about it?
The Fiery Priest,"Is it just me or are we at a tipping point where Guy Fieri is just finally getting recognized as “awesome”. Just a good guy who sticks to his guns at every turn. Goes to show that if you are yourself long enough, even if you’re a little left of center, you’ll be respected for it."
The Fiery Priest,"When I first saw Guy Fieri I blew him and his show off as just another Food Network run of the mill show. When I saw him at an Arlington TX restaurant I am fond of as well as an Oklahoma City restaurant I favored, I got on the triple D Guy Fieri train and have not yet gotten off. He is a really great guy. I record all of his triple G shows - they are so much fun to watch and so is he."
The Fiery Priest,No one can shit on this guy. The amount of good things he’s done is something to look up to.
The Fiery Priest,"As a line cook, guy fieri is freaking awesome. So many of these celebrity chefs like David Chang or Gordon Ramsay are just utterly toxic shit heels... but then you have this guy, and as ridiculous as his persona is he's actually out there HELPING us rather than exploiting us.

What a damned hero. Fuck you David Chang!"
The Fiery Priest,"I’m your buddy, Guy!"
The Fiery Priest,I’m just here to give some love for this picture.
The Fiery Priest,"The tournament of champions was great. He gave away 10,000 every round winners choice."
The Fiery Priest,I guess he can buy more yellow cars now.
The Fiery Priest,He really helps small restaurants with his show. This is so great!
The Fiery Priest,Guy is an American icon.
The Fiery Priest,"This is such a great profile. Guy is not for everyone and not for every occasion, but there really is something comforting and fun about his shows that I love. I also like the accessibility of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives - aside for $40 a Day (s/o Rachel on that one for fr) I can’t think of any other food show where every restaurant and dish is somewhere that feels like somewhere I’d want to try when I go to a new place."
The Fiery Priest,More cotton candy machines
The Fiery Priest,The guy also routinely donates enormous amounts of money to California's wild fire fighters. When those insane fires happened in Sonoma a couple years ago I believe he paid for and helped serve a couple hundred  thousand meals to displaced citizens and Frontline workers. I lived in Northern California at the time and it made me feel like a dick for ever thinking negatively about the dude
The Fiery Priest,"I have met Guy on a couple of occasions, Just when he was started on food network. I meant him and a bunch of those Chefs on food network.. He was always cool, never spoke down to anyone, always polite.. When your a chef you gotta be direct, that might be where some people think he was a dick"
The Fiery Priest,The man is a national treasure
The Fiery Priest,The man exudes sex
The Fiery Priest,"If there's one thing I've learned about restaurant owners during this pandemic, is that most of them are fucking cunts and don't deserve a dime.

I get that people are anxious and desperate, but the number of ""We're not the mask police! Come hang out!"" signs I saw far outnumbered the ones that actually followed the rules, and I live in a relatively sane area about these things. 

If there's a good way to weed the good ones out from the bad, relief away. But I don't want a single dime of my money going to these fucking cunts."
The Fiery Priest,On another note how about you make sure the restaurants with your name on it don't suck?
The Fiery Priest,"I have absolutely no desire to watch his shows or eat his food, but if he is helping the restaurant industry, then good on him."
The Fiery Priest,He’s a good guy.
The Fiery Priest,Dude talks all big about helping local restaurants but on the east coast has set up ghost kitchens that are throttling the takeout business that most placing are relying on to keep afloat
The Fiery Priest,"Let’s take a moment first and offer actual benefits to restaurant employees. I’m 18 years in the industry and 8/10 restaurants don’t offer insurance, paid time off, sick days, or anything other than a shift beer. If you call out for being sick, they make you come in and prove you’re sick and if they deem you not sick they’ll cut you from the schedule. Burn yourself badly? Sink an oyster knife into your palm? Drop from heat exhaustion? Your back is fucked from standing in shit tile floors for 14hrs without a break? Nah fuck you pussy get back to work. Shift meal? Psh are you on a double? No? Then No. 

Don’t just throw money at business owners who will put that $$ into their vacation account, make them offer living wages and the ability to have a life outside of work. Or let the place go under. Guy crowd funded his restaurants during the Pandemic but how much of his own $$ did he toss in? I like him, but I know Chefs all too well and they’re self serving mother fuckers when you get down to the nitty gritty."
The Fiery Priest,meh.
The Fiery Priest,https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/2021-04-Guy-Fieri-restaurant-discrimination-16132878.php
The Fiery Priest,"Wow, is Guy Fieri can push for a Massive New Deal. Then Biden can push for The Green New Deal. No excuses 😂"
The Fiery Priest,Isn’t this guy homophobic?
The Fiery Priest,I cannot stand this schmuck.
The Fiery Priest,"I really dont enjoy his shows. He basically on the food network every damn day. And it's all garbage diner food. I dont get what the hype is all about for Guy or what he did to get every timeslot of the foodnetwork, but its annoying"
The Fiery Priest,Douche with a posse gets buku bucks for acting like a douche and pretending to cook. Truly the American Dream personified.
The Fiery Priest,"I like the guy, he’s a force of nature and does good stuff. But even me leaning left (socialist, so left of mainstream American politics) I’m weary of the relief. There’s a hangover than comes after doing such things. I sadly don’t have any great solutions that are acceptable by the red and the blue parties.

But damn, I admire his drive (pun intended). Would love it if he did a series about restaurants that had to close due to covid, but relaunched afterwards. To drive up interest in them. He’s got a lot of eyeballs at him. 

Go guy!"
The Fiery Priest,"I once bought a 7 pepper salsa from “Guy Fieri” rated almost as “hot” has his rating scale could go.

Needless to say, I had to mix it with “Tropical Pepper Co.” *GHOST PEPPER* to even “spice it up”.

Been something on my mind for a while, just taking advantage of the news to point out his idea of hot could be lotion for some of us. 

I’d rather restaurants like my local steakhouse that makes FANTASTIC rare steak, than a lie in a bottle, and that they continue to obey the rules. What good is a dead customer? The restaurants in my area at least understand the importance of safety, not brand recognition. 

Fieri, you’re in this for personal reasons and at least fix your shit salsa.

I’m tired of “celebs” who come out the woodwork like termites to find a way to be legitimate after fading into obscurity long after their prime.

As for that salsa?

Tostitos “Hot” was way hotter and even that’s mild."
The Fiery Priest,He could cure children of cancer and I’d still want to punch him in the face. Just look at how punchable his face is. I can’t help it.
The Fiery Priest,I don’t care how much charity work he does I still don’t like his stupid hair or his bad food.
The Fiery Priest,That's nice and all but you're still going to need people to get out of that scared bubble they are all in and actually go out again. Far too many scared people out there that just need to get out there and live.
The Fiery Priest,"Well of course, how else is he going to stuff his fucking face and talk with his mouth full at us?"
The Fiery Priest,He is the fucking worst how did this dude make it as a celebrity. He sure didn’t make it as a chef
The Fiery Priest,"Restaurants are drug pushers. There are too many. Their food isn't worthwhile for the most part. It certainly is making America fat, like Guy Fieri. There should be fewer restaurants and less eating out, at restaurants."
The Fiery Priest,When is the next Smash Mouth album though?
The Fiery Priest,"My cousin’s husband used to work at the casinos in Atlantic City and Chester Pa. 

Guy opened up a burger restaurant. He was there for a few days. He fed the casino staff for free for a week while getting things up and running. Took pictures, signed autographs, talked about cooking and cars... 

Everyone who interacted with him absolutely loved him afterwards."
The Fiery Priest,"Dammit Guy, you make me love you."
The Fiery Priest,"I do not dig Guy Fieri’s schtick, but I dig Guy Fieri the human. He does no wrong."
The Fiery Priest,Guy is a good guy!
The Fiery Priest,In 2028 when he runs for president of the union he'll have my vote
The Fiery Priest,"I think you can probably thank Shane Torres for firing the salvo that changed people’s minds about him.

I used to be a hater and I’ll never forget the review of his s’mores pizza as tasting like a campfire, but he’s a good dude, his shows are fun as hell, and he clearly gives a fuck and people and his industry. Gotta give that dude solid daps."
The Fiery Priest,"He’s like the Bono of the food world. He does all this awesome stuff for people and yet somehow I still just don’t like him much.

It’s not him, it’s me."
The Fiery Priest,"[Can someone please explain to me what the hell Guy Fieri ever did to anyone?](https://youtu.be/JK6zuii2OLI)

I post this whenever a Guy Fieri post comes up on Reddit."
The Fiery Priest,"He's a lot like Dolly Parton.

Looks like a fucking idiot, but is in fact a total saint"
The Fiery Priest,Flavortown deserves proper representation in congress
The Fiery Priest,"On the carnival triumph, they have a guy’s burger joint, the burgers are amazing and you can have as many as you want. It was like 8 years ago, can anyone confirm if it is still there"
The Fiery Priest,I like Guy.
The Fiery Priest,Way to step up to the plate
The Fiery Priest,"He’s also the pride of Long Beach when he worked at one of the best breakfast spots in all of Orange County, Schooner or Later. Mad respect for the Mayor of Flavortown!"
The Fiery Priest,I changed my mind about Guy a while ago. Many of you hit the nail on the head with everything he's done which is nothing but good. He just helps people. Aside from Jose Andres I'm not sure if there are others making big impact.  It's obviously press that brings awareness so there could be others doing great things. Just hope this corner turns and he can go back to smother his flip flop in the sauces!
The Fiery Priest,I absolutely hate that I like this guy now... I have spent over a decade hating on him... DDD!
The Fiery Priest,King
The Fiery Priest,"Good guy, Guy. This article was fabulous. His studio in Santa Rosa donates $350,000 in food to a local mission. $25 million dollars raised in restaurant relief. $210,000 in prize money for direct relief in a recent competition show. Fucking legend."
The Fiery Priest,class act all around
The Fiery Priest,"During COVID-19, so many people showed their asses for all the world to see. Yet, somehow Guy Fieri comes out looking like a newborn baby because he showed decency to his fellow man. He’s one of the few people who came out of COVID with a better public perception. I won’t criticize the man ever again (unless he does something awful)."
The Fiery Priest,[deleted]
The Fiery Priest,With that picture I thought he died I almost had a heart attack
The Fiery Priest,I wonder I'd michael symon has done anything for the restaurant industry also.
The Fiery Priest,My liege of flavor town!
The Fiery Priest,"Live in Hawaii, work in retail environment. Guy visit store and continuously torn off his mask to show his face. Store has corporate policy that everyone wears mask. Asked him kindly repeatedly to wear mask as we are all on camera and could be reprimanded. Guy let’s out the biggest sigh and basically acts like we are asking for his first born. No longer a fan. You do you celebrity person who just needs to show their face to feel good."
The Fiery Priest,I fucking love this Guy.
The Fiery Priest,"Fuck the restaurants. They are not essential yet we’re allowed to stay in business through the pandemic. That aside, tip wages are exploitation. They don’t need relief."
The Fiery Priest,On jah every time I see a celeb pic I think someone’s died- for a moment I was scared we’d lost the mayor of Flavortown himself
The Fiery Priest,Keeping every bodies individual flavor town :0
The Fiery Priest,I always thought of him as a tool. Maybe it was the Chili's-type food or the hair or his playing up his personality for the cameras? I was absolutely wrong. He’s a stand up Guy. Pun intended.
The Fiery Priest,King of Flavor Town
The Fiery Priest,I could totally beat guy fieri in a fight against
The Fiery Priest,"No joke, a long time I ago I heard this guy's name and the band Smash Mouth in the same sentence and since then I thought this guy was the lead singer of Smash Mouth until yesterday when I randomly looked at his Wikipedia page and Smash Mouth was not to be found."
The Fiery Priest,I don’t care what anyone says. Guy Fieri is a stand up guy Fieri.
The Fiery Priest,"This man is right up there with Alton Brown as one of my favorite Food Network peeps. Yes, he presents himself primarily as an entertainer, but the man knows his cooking, and he knows that the most important thing you can do with food is make someone else happy.

D3 is one of my favorite background-noise shows, and honestly his newer show, Guy's Grocery Games (which I just realized can be shortened to G3), is really fun when it comes to the weird shopping restrictions.

I'm really happy that he's got the brand recognition to be able to do stuff like this to help out his fellow foodies."
The Fiery Priest,"Looks like a troll doll who eats garbage,is actually a really decent dude. Good on him."
The Fiery Priest,"If he wants to be cool that’s all good and people appreciate it, but I am curious if anyone out there is hanging onto this 90’s hair look as hard as he is? I feel like he pretty much owns this hair at this point as all the others have moved on."
The Fiery Priest,"Barstool Sports is way ahead of Guy on restaurant relief, having raised almost 40 million and counting for that cause."
The Fiery Priest,Honestly what a great guy
The Fiery Priest,That’s right
The Fiery Priest,Fun fact: Guy Fieri’s real name was Guy Ferry.
The Fiery Priest,What a legend!!
The Fiery Priest,"Seems like he’s genuinely “good people”.

I bet knowing he’s got to keep up the bleached, spikey hairdo and Costas thing well into his fifties bugs him at night when he’s trying to get some mf rest."
The Fiery Priest,Every time I read an article on Guy I come away liking him even more.
Reunited Worlds,I hate you have to pay to read the full thing
Reunited Worlds,"[here ya go, care of Archive.is](https://archive.is/vPc4V)

Reunited Worlds,You are awesome! Thank you
Reunited Worlds,[deleted]
Reunited Worlds,Including **both** Morgans.
Reunited Worlds,Will Friedle is the only one who still has the same magic.
Reunited Worlds,"Yep, Topenga's still hot. "
Reunited Worlds,"There's a scene after this that isn't in this that was the big heartwarming moment of the series.

Shawn and Maya's Mom get married (long arc), and a big reason they're together is because of how much Maya reminds him of himself. Latchkey kid, severe daddy issues, almost crazily attached to their best friends. Shawn surprises Maya in the middle of the episode by bringing formal adoption papers, which would legally make him her dad. She starts to tear up and get happy. Mr. Turner says he's proud of Shawn, and that his big regret in life was never adopting him so he could have a stable father figure in his life. Big group hug. "
Reunited Worlds,The Eric/Feeny bromance lives on
Reunited Worlds,Where's Frankie and Vader?
Reunited Worlds,[deleted]
Reunited Worlds,"Who is the dude standing between Shawn and Cory's dad? Also the blonde girl between Shawn and the guy?

If its someone from Bot Meets World, I can't tell. 

I recognize his brother Eric , Mr. Turner, Minkus, Mom & Dad, and Shawn and Feeny. "
Reunited Worlds,"Damn, it's been cancelled already?  It feels like it was just last year when I started seeing trailers for the premiere.  "
Reunited Worlds,Wait there's 3 Matthews brothers is this new or did it happen on boy meets world and I forgot about it.
Reunited Worlds,[deleted]
Reunited Worlds,Fucking Minkus.
Reunited Worlds,wait is the show already coming to an end? has it been cancelled? feel like it was just yesterday show started
Reunited Worlds,I wonder why Disney didn't get Maitland Ward for this...
Reunited Worlds,is there an actual feeney call in the episode?!?
Reunited Worlds,That show sucked
Reunited Worlds,"I don't think they need to focus only on the adults, they can focus on the kids, they just need to make the adults a more positive and stronger role in the kids lives.

In BMW Feeny was the wise teacher and Cory's parents were strong stable figures in Cory's life.  [You can see just how different it is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuPmqEAofKM)

On GMW Cory is both parent and teacher, and he acts the part of an idiot.  Typical Disney channel shit where they make parents act like ""wacky"" adults to make the Kids feel more important."
Reunited Worlds,Thanks! That answers my question.
Reunited Worlds,There's someone out there that looks dead on just like her and does porn. Just sayin'.
Reunited Worlds,What happened between them to argue like that?
Reunited Worlds,"Vader's dying and likely has less than a year to live, unfortunately. "
Reunited Worlds,"at a live taping , the audience is seated fairly far away and behind the cameras, mics, grips, etc.... and your only real view of the action is what you see on the monitors, which pretty much give you the TV POV ...just live ....
or they were being coached"
Reunited Worlds,"Harley, their old bully. Girl who is meeting world's best friend's mom who is married to Shawn now."
Reunited Worlds,"That is Harley, the high school bully. "
Reunited Worlds,The parents had a baby the last season I believe 
Reunited Worlds,"No. They're just like ""oh, there's two Morgans"" and acted like it wasn't weird at all (except for Corey's son Auggie, who questioned if there would be two versions of himself someday). No explanation storywise at all."
Reunited Worlds,Because the world is meeting her girls?
Reunited Worlds,I don't disagree but Corey was always kind of an idiot 
Reunited Worlds,BMW really does hold up. Got the whole series on DVD and I look forward to eventually watching it with my kids when they're old enough. 
Reunited Worlds,"My gosh, you're totally right. That's such a serious scene and there were many scenes like that in the BMW series. GMW is just...not as serious."
Reunited Worlds,"Who are you referring to? You know, for science"
Reunited Worlds,Nobody knows.
Reunited Worlds,Just realized I don't think Harley got a scene at the end. Why'd he show up? 
Reunited Worlds,Now I think of it I don't think I watched most of the later ones with Joey Lawrence's brother 
Reunited Worlds,"He was, but in GMW you can't be all three. "
Reunited Worlds,"GMW tried being this serious all the time, but most of the episodes were about love triangles or middle school issues. It worked better when they tackled parental abandonment, bullying, religion, etc. "
Reunited Worlds,"""Teen Topenga"""
Reunited Worlds,Because he was recurring in the show. Showed up in a few episodes. Basically anyone from BMW that showed up in a few episodes was in the finale.  Minus Minkus. 
Reunited Worlds,Both he and Minkus had scenes that were cut.
Reunited Worlds,I wish he hadn't been the teacher. 
Reunited Worlds,"There are similarities, but she looks like if Topanga had a mega trashy evil twin. "
Reunited Worlds,I don't see the resemblance. I think Emilia Clarke looks like a young Topanga.
Reunited Worlds,Minkus is right there at the 12 second mark
Reunited Worlds,It's all about screen time. How much screen time did Cory's dad get? 
Reunited Worlds,"Shit, really? I guess I have to re-watch it. I never noticed him at all. "
Reunited Worlds,About as much as Cory would have had if he was t the teacher. 
Reunited Worlds,"Mike Myers and Kanye West, together again."
Reunited Worlds,I was so happy they did this. After all this time the chemistry between the characters was still spot on!
Reunited Worlds,What's wrong with that audience? They sound dead.
Reunited Worlds,"That was great. But they totally ruined the ""We're not worthy!"" line by showing the cue cards. "
Reunited Worlds,I thought I heard somewhere that Mike Meyers and Dana Carvey didn't get along very well or am I totally remembering things incorrectly?
Reunited Worlds,Kaye would wear those fucking contacts
Reunited Worlds,Anybody got a mirror for us non-americans?
Reunited Worlds,[deleted]
Reunited Worlds,"The actual reunion here, it's the 10th anniversary of Katrina. Mike and Kanye should reenact their skit together."
Reunited Worlds,Dana looks exactly the same. I miss these guys.
Reunited Worlds,It's all famous  people who are used to being cheered for not cheering. 
Reunited Worlds,"This was the last skit of a 4 hour long show, their hands probably hurt at that point."
Reunited Worlds,I thought that was kinda neat.
Reunited Worlds,"I believe you are correct, and I think it was actually because of their Lorne Michaels impersonations. Dana Carvey was angry because Mike Myers used his for Dr. Evil, or something like that. I was happy to see them both do it here. "
Reunited Worlds,I'm French and I can watch it. Maybe try the zenmate plug-in for your browser it works great 
Reunited Worlds,"Come on, Mr. Belding got fat, Mike's just got some pudge."
Reunited Worlds,"And Dan Aykroyd used to be the skinny Blues Brother, and now he's fatter than the fat brother's fatter brother. "
Reunited Worlds,It's called getting old.
Reunited Worlds,"Yea I noticed that after I commented, even saw Jerry sitting behind Kanye."
Reunited Worlds,"Well yeah it was neat, but I totally wasn't expecting the ""We're not worthy!"" line... and that kind of ruined it when it did come. "
Reunited Worlds,"Yeah, Mike Myer's just looks like an average, middle-aged dude. He certainly doesn't look ""awful."""
Reunited Worlds,"Yeah, he used to be ridiculously skinny.  I thought he actually looked healthy. "
Reunited Worlds,"Wait, Eric Matthews is a mayor now? Wasn't he clinically insane last time we saw him?"
Reunited Worlds,Season 2 of GMW has me all kinds of messed up 
Reunited Worlds,"Woah!

That kid got ugly. Touching scene though."
Reunited Worlds,"hang on a tick, was that a [Harley Keiner sighting at 2:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJlblKmSLIk&feature=youtu.be&t=141)??


"
Reunited Worlds,"Beyond this moment, I really don't like how they've handled Eric.  He's just *stupid*.  It's funny at times, but with how close everyone else is to how they were before they seemed to have forgotten that Eric was still a smart guy that acted silly.  Now it's just joke after joke of him being an idiot. "
Reunited Worlds,"So not expected, but holy shit was it great. "
Reunited Worlds,"I don't watch this show regularly, but I said before it started that if they brought back an original cast member (other than Cory/Topanga), I would tune in for that episode. Now they're bringing back everyone and I feel like I'm stuck. 

To top it all off, JACK is coming back for an upcoming season 2 episode, and I may cry because Matthew Lawrence should never go that long without having his face on my screen."
Reunited Worlds,Is it just me or they see that they arent getting any good results and are just cheaply exploiting any emotional link to the original series to keep it going ?
Reunited Worlds,someone over the age of 5 is watching this?
Reunited Worlds,He is the Mayor of St. Upid town.
Reunited Worlds,"Apparently, Mr. Turner comes back on Friday's episode."
Reunited Worlds,"Haha, yes.  It's the same character and actor too.  He is now is a Janitor at the school Corey works at/Riley goes to."
Reunited Worlds,I don't think Eric was ever smart. He was an average girl crazed boy that got flanderdized into an idiot who was occasionally an idiot savant.
Reunited Worlds,"So they're being  consistent with the last five seasons of *Boy Meets World*, then."
Reunited Worlds,"i love this fan theory that ""explains it"" : https://www.reddit.com/comments/r1hp0 "
Reunited Worlds,The links to the original series are probably nothing more than fan service. I'm sure the show is doing just fine.
Reunited Worlds,"The creator extended the invite to anyone from the original show, saying they would write in a role for anyone that accepted it. Most of the original cast did. "
Reunited Worlds,no thats just the reddit crowd
Reunited Worlds,haha nice! do they have the same Harley/Corey interactions as they did in BMW?  As in Harley still semi-bulleying Corey?
Reunited Worlds,It's like how Charlie in Always Sunny was a complete idiot for 8-9 seasons and now is the smartest and most sane person in the group.
Reunited Worlds,"There was a hole story line in one of the high school seasons about him not realizing his potential to get into college.  He was never Smart with a capital S, but he wasn't the idiot he is now once the show found its feet. "
Reunited Worlds,yeah they dont make whole episodes about the old characters.  The show stands on its own without cameos of the old cast for sure.  I mean some of the old cast is IN the new cast as the stars(Cory and Topanga) You really dont need more than that. 
Reunited Worlds,"Nah, they're buds now. Harley still calls him Johnny Baboon sometimes though."
Reunited Worlds,"Haha yeah, I think there was an episode about it in the first season even."
Reunited Worlds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRbVpg5-gs4
Reunited Worlds,"> and now is the smartest and most sane person in the group.

Despite the fact he hasn't really changed at all as a character. The people around him are just that much more insane.

"
Reunited Worlds,The more Shawn the better though. 
Reunited Worlds,"Haha awesome! It's pretty cool that parents can enjoy this show with their kids; they enjoy it for the returning cast while their kids enjoy it for the the ""new"" show that it is. Then maybe they can even show them how it all started with BMW. "
2025,"We asked 750 million people - if you were stuck on a desert island with a restaurant dishwasher, what kind of shoes would he be wearing?"
2025,"Name one thing a man has between his legs...

A Penis!

Steve stares at the camera in utter disbelief"
2025,"Apparently Reddit doesn't like Family Feud. Well, I like it. It's a lot of fun."
2025,"That'll take this version past 25 years, with it being the Steve Harvey show for 15.

Damn, he's been hosting longer than Dawson, Combs, everybody else."
2025,There has to be like basically nothing on for me to watch this lol
2025,"Hopefully they also increase Steve’s wardrobe budget, he’s got some great suits on the feud"
2025,"I'm a fan of this show, but is there a rule where you can't actually pass the game to the other family? Everyone decides to play every time, but I'm pretty sure you could run the table if you just pass every time. It's near impossible to see one family get all the words without giving the other family the chance to steal"
2025,This show has become unwatchable since every question has become sexual.
2025,I enjoy the Feud. Will always watch if it’s on. Have been casually watching it since the 1970s. I think Steve Harvey is a fine host for the show.  I’ll hang up and take your response off line.
2025,Where can I watch family feud for free online?
2025,I want “Honest Family Feud” where if someone gives a dumb answer the dad shakes his head and calls his son a retard
2025,Okay but can we replace Steve Harvey with someone who isn't a piece of shit?
2025,I clearly remember in 2009 playing **FARMVILLE** on Facebook and seeing an ad that Steve was coming to Family Feud and I just knew shit wasn’t going to be good
2025,"I liked family feud right up until Steve Harvey started hosting it. I don't care for his hosting style at all, which seems to be that a contestant gives a perfectly predictable answer, and then Steve just stares at the camera with a stupid looking face for five minutes."
2025,"family feud needs a better host with class

bring back John O'Hurley i liked him being the host with the 2006 set"
2025,Let this shit die
2025,Why
2025,My a they could change the prize money.  It’s the cheapest game show in tv.  It lets the winners have a crack at one easy Fast Money puzzle and then hard puzzles if they win again.   You never see anyone win those cheap  jeeps they show.   Steve Harvey spends more on suits than the contestants win
2025,"For me, this is my favorite show to watch during lunch break while working from home sometimes. Cheesy but much needed!"
2025,Can we get more jerk off questions about Steve Harvey on the show? Those are the best.
2025,More YouTube clips of Steve Harvey looking shocked.
2025,**NEKKID GRANDMA!**
2025,vagina
2025,This is not remotely sexually suggestive enough to work as a Family Feud question
2025,You can't say that on TV!!!
2025,A saddle.
2025,"Totally. IMO, the Price is Right & Family Feud are the best game shows out there."
2025,"It's just that the ""vulgar"" answers aren't amusing to me anymore. They were in the 80s because they were few and far between. So when one was said the host's reaction was genuine and you usually only saw the outtakes on shows like ""TVs bloopers and practical jokes"". Now it's almost mandatory to have at least one mention of genitals/sex act per episode for the ""lols""."
2025,"Pretty sure it's Steve Harvey they don't like, not the show itself."
2025,"reddit is vocal about not l liking alot of things lol, but I enjoy the show along with PIR and lets make a deal"
2025,"Personally I love FF, I just loathe Steve Harvey, as he is a massive bigot."
2025,I hate Steve Harvey but enjoy watching Family Feud. I wish he'd get replaced as host.
2025,"No, Reddit doesn't like Christian Extremist Steve Harvey"
2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuVeSRLi2Fw
2025,ohh you poor simple minded creature
2025,"I know his “fake shock as suggestive answer” gimmick is made fun of, but he’s well-suited for this super cheesy game show."
2025,Then there's my dad who watches it all the time and even watches highlight clips of it on youtube.
2025,"That’s usually my thinking too, but then I get sucked into a game show marathon for 4 hours"
2025,"I watch the noon showing when I’m feeding my 9 month old, mainly because it’s after Price is Right. I swear I’m not 70 years old lol"
2025,If I need a pick me up I like to watch game show bloopers compilations on YouTube. Family Feud is usually featured heavily in those.
2025,"Loved when Johnny Knoxville arranged to be wearing the exact same suit when he appeared.

I've never really watched much of Jackass, but their collective appearance on Celebrity Family Feud was **EPIC**."
2025,[Steve’s great advice for making a ton of variety in your suit wear with only five suits](https://youtu.be/hPAJaj9kol0)
2025,He has his own suit brand. That wardrobe budget goes right into his pocket.
2025,Bring on the plorange!
2025,"You can pass. It’s just very rare when they do it. 
I think people just get excited, and want to be on TV and talk to Steve. 

There’s some strategy to it as well."
2025,"The problem with that strategy is the family who passed *must* come up with an answer that is on the board when it is their chance to steal. If you watch enough of the show, you’ll see that many times - maybe even more often than not - the stealing team’s answer isn’t on the board, so the points revert back to the playing team. Usually, the only time a team steals successfully is if the playing team completely brain farts on one of the top two answers for the question. As such, the smarter route is usually to play, because even if your team cannot sweep the board, as long as you can get the top three or four answers, the odds of the other team successfully stealing are very low."
2025,"I've seen a pass done three times, and two of those times Harvey mocked the family for doing it. It's like he has no idea about the rules or strategy."
2025,*Steve pretending to be shocked*
2025,"I work on Family Feud Canada and we had 2 families go to sudden death one year. I think the question was something like “what is something you eat frozen” and the guy answered “a cat”. Of course the other person got a normal answer and won. 

His entire family was so pissed at him and were like “why would you say that??”"
2025,"Nope. Steve Harvey brought the ratings.

Why don’t they ever call Pat Sajak and Chuck Woolery pieces of shit?"
2025,"Yeah, it’s shocking that he is a celebrity after he revealed his true nature…."
2025,You could just not watch it lol
2025,**CUPINE!**
2025,"Good answer, good answer!"
2025,Grandma’s answer
2025,I was talking about my rug.
2025,wheel of fortune is the greatest game show of all time
2025,"No that would be Lingo, Rupaul is such a blast hosting the new one!"
2025,Press Your Luck is also top tier
2025,I think adding dirty questions took all the fun out of it. It was funny when the questions were clean and the dirty guesess were rare and surprising.
2025,And STOOOOPID!
2025,"Honestly, he's part of why the show is still running.

Before he took over and it started to morph into what it is now, it was flirting with cancellation. And they started to play to his strengths, made the questions more suggestive to elicit the right reactions, and it wound up top of the syndicated heap."
2025,It's perfect for him honestly
2025,"If he has a Roku or something like that and doesn't know, there's an entire Family Feud channel dedicated to clips and random episodes."
2025,My mom watches it all day long. It's not a bad background show honestly.
2025,This is legit great advice. Wish someone told me that sooner
2025,Yup. You always play for this exact reason.
2025,"Steve pretending not to be a misogynistic, garbage human."
2025,Found where Alf went...
2025,"Are they pieces of shit? Cause Steve Harvey is like publicly a piece of shit.

I have no nostalgia for em so I’m genuinely curious."
2025,"I love original Lingo with Chuck Woolery, I think he came off as very professional at least in the show, but the new lingo with Rupaul is incredible fun.

Eta apparently Chuck wasn't the first host I guess, Bill Engvall suuucked though I guess I purged that from my memory."
2025,Or Dawson? That dude straight up kissed every woman who was on the show.
2025,They do. This thread is not about those shows. Take your whataboutism and go elsewhere.
2025,He's as big a bastard as Dr. Phil
2025,**WHAT** is “cupine?” This is the greatest answer I’ve ever heard!
2025,"Steve Harvey

2025,X
2025,"According to the Emmys, it’s Jeopardy. Wheel of Fortune only won one."
2025,"Rupaul is great on that show; however, the game itself is kind of boring."
2025,I think reddit overstates how many dirty questions there are.
2025,"Even if the show was cancelled back then and Steve Harvey did other projects, it still would have come back at a later date."
2025,"They are hardcore conservatives. Chuck Woolery had been really controversial about his views but he doesn’t host anything major anymore. Pat Sajak has made his conservatism clear over the years. Sajak gave a platform to Rush Limbaugh back in the 80s which may have helped him get more popularity.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11228663/amp/Pat-Sajak-dubbed-MAGA-Fascist-daring-grinning-photo-Marjorie-Taylor-Greene.html"
2025,"I thought it was one of the most brilliant ""definitely not on the board"" answers ever.

It's a shame Steve didn't appear to understand it at all at the time. It left him utterly confused."
2025,"*Vagina is #1 answer*

Steve Harvey 

（╯°□°）╯"
2025,Or pretending to have a stroke and falling over.
2025,"No, they aren't.  It really is about one an episode."
2025,"Of course.

It would've been back within 5 years. The two times it was canceled, Family Feud was never off the air for more than 3 or 4 years, and odds are ABC would've picked it up around 2016 when they started Pyramid and Match Game and their hourlong game show jag."
2025,"No idea about his political leanings, but Pat Sajak comes off as a prick every night on his show lol.  My wife and tend to have it on in the background before Jeopardy and it's funny how often we end up commenting on it.  He just seems like a douche.  Maybe that's just his thing, his character or something?  No idea, and he's had the job for so long it must be working, but it always cracks us up.  He seems like he hates the contestants half the time, and is just barely concealing it."
2025,Sajak is also a POS
2025,how dare someone not agree with you. he must be a piece of a shit.
2025,Fortunately the Family Feud YouTube channel put the whole episode up: https://youtu.be/Rr6YU3gCCtM
2025,Its shocking to me he did an interview a year or two ago that he still thinks it was the dumbest answer but they literally had the same thing happen with pot ato  he mocked the lady and it ended up on the board
2025,He’s not very bright
2025,You mean like Steve Harvey?
2025,"For those who liked The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Josh Robert Thompson (Geoff) makes frequent appearances in this show during her games with celebrities as the Judge/Voice of ""God"""
2025,"It's worth it just for the clip when Anne Hathaway guesses her song before her.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y87zAsTSUsM"
2025,"From the few seconds I've watched here 'n there, it seems like she opens up her show with a mini-performance of sorts- she sings with a band backing her up (or sometimes at least). That's unique and dope. 

Good for Kelly."
2025,Good for her. She seems nice
2025,She's doing do brilliantly 👏
2025,She’s like Ellen without the evil
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"My opinion is still somewhat up in the air about the show. I love steampunk and I do enjoy a bit of slice of life anime as well. The show makes me think of a old show I saw when I was younger for some reason( Ōban Star-Racers ).

I don't really have a huge problem with the sky whaling, except the show seems to have mixed messages. Sometimes it seems like they are saying sky whaling is fine and should be encouraged and then they show scenes where the dragons look really sad and it is a bad thing. Spoilers ahead: When the main girl saves the baby dragon and cares for it so she can return it to it's herd and then tell it she is going to fucking hunt and eat it later, wtf. I thought it was building to a "" We should not hunt these majestic creatures who are very intelligent."" It just leaves a sour taste in my mouth, since these dragons are cute and they seem pretty nice."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"Saw the first episode and it felt like it was made by someone who must be staunchly pro-whaling. I'm not exactly a vegan but even I found the cheerful and humorous vibe of this show that centers around the slaughter of massive, beautiful creatures somewhat disturbing."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,Got some serious Last Exile vibes from this series
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"Interesting world which is the main reason I enjoyed this show. 
I am not bothered by the whaling aspect so to me this was a non issue.
Characters desperately need some background to them which is my main complaint."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"I watched the anime up to ep12, and I have to comment on the theme of the anime it's obvious that it trys to make whaling look like a cool thing to do, like since the first episode I've been waiting for the show to show us that these ""dragons"" are dangerous or evil or atleast a threat that needs to be stopped but as far as ep12 ""dragons"" seem to be really gentle creatures and quite beautiful who are in no way harmful or even dangerous to humans unless provoked or attacked, and I don't see why do they hunt them it's not profitable since during the entire show the crew seem to be broke as hell and the only money they make is used to keep the ship going so they hunt a whale ehm a DRAGON and they sell it's parts to make up for the expenses of hunting it in the first place with a very small margin of profit which then they use again to hunt another ""dragon"" which seems to be a never ending cycle which would result in them hunting every last dragon out there for no good reason, ok so I'm not a vegan I eat meat as much as the next person but I don't go to africa and hunt elephants and Rhinos just because it's fun, I don't mind eating cows and sheep yet I absolutely do mind hunting and killing endangered animals even if they taste like heaven or whatever huntinganimalsfor the sake of hunting is not something I endorse if you have cattle sheep cows chicken then why would you go out of your way to hunt a whale or a dragon?, also there is one character that freaking annoys me to no end his name is Mica (I guess that's how it's spelled) this guy is really weird like people eat cows but who the hell goes to a living cow and smell it and says wow that smells so delicious like wtf ? Who does that? He seems more like a wild beast and it looks like he would eat these ""dragons"" alive if he got the chance to, the show keeps trying to make him all cool and amazing but he just comes off as a jerk, there is one episode where they encounter a shining or glittering ""dragon"" which is considered to be a myth and very rare and all he thinks about is I'm going to hunt it and eat it. Anyway anyone else kinda bothered by the message of the show? it seems to be super pro whaling and is trying to romanticize the practice of whaling which something I'm against. Just needed to get this out there and see if anyon else thinks the same :p"
DRIFTING DRAGONS,Came here to find something similar written by viewers here. I downvoted the show simply because I can't stand this pro-hunting narrative the show seems to promote.
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"check the manga for that, the anime just covers the begining of it, I also don't have a problem with the whaling aspect, my chilhood me would porbably slap my face fot saying that."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"I agree with your most of you points, but for the love of god, figure out how to break up your paragraphs."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"Sorry, English is not my language and all I know is from watching movies and tv shows."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,"Generally, group your paragraphs into 1-6 sentences. Try to keep each one ""themed"" around the same topic before you switch to another topic, or even another sub-topic. It makes it much easier to digest what you are trying to say.

Think of it like a meal. If you want different flavors to stand out, you prepare several different types of food and put them next to each other on the plate. You can mix it all together, and sometimes that works, but it makes it very hard to quickly know what the contents of the meal are.

I have no idea what your native language is, or how it's formatted, so I apologize if any of that seemed patronizing."
DRIFTING DRAGONS,I’m intrigued a bit.  Anyone familiar with this IP?
DRIFTING DRAGONS," **\*please do not watch this show\***

It is bald-on-its-face attempt to make Japanese commercial whaling look cute."
Cheer,We watched a hell of a lot of Cheers over the pandemic and the joke density and quality is unbelievable. And there’s actual character development beyond everyone just becoming caricatures of themselves and all eventually speaking with the same voice like on more modern sitcoms. Truly the GOAT.
Cheer,"""Hey Norm, what's shakin'?""

""Both chins and all four cheeks."""
Cheer,"Don't even need to click on the video and I know the punchline 😆 ""Right over there,  behind Norm."""
Cheer,I've never watched this show and even I found this clip hilarious 😂
Cheer,"[Here is my favorite](https://youtu.be/9pxRMxnxAjM?t=39)

Everyone is genuinely laughing, you can see John R trying to hold it in."
Cheer,"Used to watch this show when I was a kid because my Dad had it on, for some reason I enjoyed it enough then. Now in my 40's I've started it again from the beginning and it's become one of my favourite shows. Literal laugh out loud moments."
Cheer,The greatest sitcom that ever was.
Cheer,"""NORM!"""
Cheer,So is the joke Norm has been going to Cheers for over 20 years?
Cheer,My favorite cold open ever!
Cheer,Gold
Cheer,"That's such a great joke. 

This is the one show my parents watched that I liked staying up to watch with them."
Cheer,"They just announced a Blu-Ray set of the entire series for April 25th ($130):

https://thedigitalbits.com/columns/my-two-cents/021323-1400"
Cheer,"Norm was in his 30s. Reminds me of a good tweet.

https://twitter.com/Rubberbandits/status/1394211540438499329"
Cheer,I've always wanted someone to band all of Cheers cold openings into one video so you could just watch them all.
Cheer,"For anyone interested, Conan needs a  friend podcast had one of the cheers Producers, James Burrows, as guest. Absolutely insightful and hilarious.

I've also heard that one of the Producers died in 9/11. Which might explain why they didn't continue to produce these kind of quality shows."
Cheer,"If this is Ted Lasso's last season, I better see Norm at the end of the bar, drinking a pint."
Cheer,Ever entered a bar and the bartender asks if he can help you before you're even done stepping in and the door hasn't even closed?
Cheer,If you like that one there's a whole lot more of those.  Alot of them really funny.
Cheer,"Thank you, I laughed so hard I choked. Did not remember this cold open."
Cheer,Cheers is definitely among the top 5 greatest. And I believe it holds the title for best theme song.
Cheer,Brilliant
Cheer,"I am just old enough to remember this when it was on. There was just a legendary run of sitcoms from the 80s to the early 2000s that went from Cheers-Seinfeld-Friends (and arguably Cheers' spinoff, Frasier). That's my golden age of sitcoms. They just don't make them like they used to anymore."
Cheer,"Cheers may be the only show that swapped out one of the main leads (Rebecca for Diane) halfway through their run and actually got better.  Usually that is the beginning of the end for a show, especially a comedy."
Cheer,"“How’s life treating you, Norm?”

“Like a baby treats a diaper “"
Cheer,"I guess that's the goal for any character, to become funny without saying or even doing anything."
Cheer,It’s not unrepresentative.  This show is legendary.
Cheer,It still holds up today obviously it's going to be somewhat dated but there's still plenty of laughs
Cheer,I just watched it last year for the first time since I was a kid. And it holds up really well. There are a couple political and pop culture references that you’d need to be an 80s history buff to get but otherwise it’s pretty timeless. Even fairy progressive by the standards back then.
Cheer,"It's one of the best sitcoms of all time, for sure. Not a wasted moment in the entire run of the show."
Cheer,It’s a classic. I would recommend a watch sometime!
Cheer,The series really takes off after they got rid of Diane.
Cheer,"Pure gold. The way Coach cracks up at his own joke too is both hilarious, infectious wonderfully wholesome!"
Cheer,"This is a great clip, thanks for sharing it"
Cheer,r/Cheers is my favorite show of all time.
Cheer,https://youtu.be/MLzYxFJnB_A
Cheer,What's it like living in a reality where MASH was never a thing? Do you still have Coffee there?
Cheer,"Cheers is great, but Frasier is better."
Cheer,Taxi would like a word
Cheer,"“How’s life treating you Norm?”

“Like he caught me in bed with his wife. “"
Cheer,"""Like a baby treats a diaper"""
Cheer,It's a dog eat dog world out there and I'm wearing Milkbone underwear.
Cheer,"Aww, he just said his first word, ""mom""."
Cheer,"“What are you up to, Norm?” 

“My ideal weight if I were eleven feet tall.”"
Cheer,The joke is the bar is different but Norm is still there sitting in his seat like he was the last time the guy was there.
Cheer,"Yeah that everything changes in 20 years. Except Norm. 

But the way they expect the audience to catch that is just a great setup."
Cheer,That’s my thought as well
Cheer,It’s pretty glaringly obvious that’s the joke. Are you German?
Cheer,"Yeah, even though it's a bit anachronistic. Norm is supposed to be in his mid-30s during the show."
Cheer,"The enormous laugh track after he noticed him didn't give it away?

Edit: I wasn't implying that the laughter was fake, just referring to the laugh. It'll be ok guys take an aspirin"
Cheer,Lol i dont get it either. Someone please explain for us
Cheer,I still tell people about [this](https://youtu.be/lvns30-6Lz0) one
Cheer,[Here's mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EUzKvtQYmI)
Cheer,"""musicians are so temperamental"" is mine"
Cheer,"Does that mean they were serving underaged kids?  If Norm was 33, that means that 20 years prior he would have only been 13."

Cheer,Well...sounds like you have a job to do :D
Cheer,"It's sadly ironic, because the producer who was killed on 9/11 had also created the show ""Wings"" (about a small airport in Nantucket which crossovered several times with Cheers characters)"
Cheer,"Burrows is pretty much the greatest sitcom director ever. He did The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Bob Newhart Show, and Laverne & Shirley in the ‘70s. He did almost every episode of Cheers and Will & Grace. He did Frasier, Night Court, Friends, Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory, and dozens of others. He’s still working now in his 80s."
Cheer,">and arguably Cheers' spinoff, Frasier

No arguably."
Cheer,I can't imagine how they'll re-make Frasier without Niles.
Cheer,Fraiser > Cheers
Cheer,Frasier is a better show than Friends in every single capacity.
Cheer,And The Nanny
Cheer,See and there’s a large argument otherwise. I like cheers more before Rebecca.
Cheer,"""It's a dog-eat-dog world, and I'm wearing Milk Bone underwear."""
Cheer,"I thought it was funny when I was in grade school and junior high, and I still think it's funny now that I'm older than Norm"
Cheer,One of the very few comedy shows that can make me bust a gut laughing and also make me tear up.
Cheer,"Hahah. I love MASH! Or at least the first 5 seasons of it. After that it got serious and comedy was pushed to the sidelines (Alan Alda wanted to do weighty stories, hence). Still, great show."
Cheer,Cheers to that
Cheer,Hard disagree.
Cheer,"I love them both so much, I’d say probably equally. Though it’s a bit lesser than both of these shows, I also really like Wings."
Cheer,Yes.
Cheer,"Nothing against Taxi, but its pacing was off. It always felt like they were putting on a play that happened to be on TV. Cheers was Taxi, but formatted specifically for TV."
Cheer,"""Women.  Can't live with 'em....... pass the beer nuts."""
Cheer,"Don't the have a ""laugh"" sign to signal the studio audience?"
Cheer,It's always the Germans
Cheer,The drinking age was 18 back then.
Cheer,"Not a laugh track, a live studio audience."
Cheer,Ask Cliff he’ll explain
Cheer,"The joke is that everything changed, except Norm. 20 years had gone by, but Norm was still there in the same seat at the same time drinking the same beer."
Cheer,It doesn’t translate well into German
Cheer,"[Here's my favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emVHcUOO9Nc), the dramatic monologue battle between Robin Colcourt and Fraser Crane."
Cheer,I knew what that would be.  Awesome.
Cheer,"Eh, it's Boston."
Cheer,Norm was 33 when the show started. He'd be early 40s by season 8.
Cheer,you are awesome
Cheer,“Love Wings!” - Quagmire
Cheer,Dude I love wings. I watched this as a real little kid at my grandparents house. It was definitely inappropriate for my age but I rewatched years ago and it’s still great
Cheer,"Just about every show on the air had a crossover with Cheers, including St. Elsewhere which means almost all television in the 90s took place inside the imagination of an autistic boy."
Cheer,Sherry Niles?
Cheer,The costume design for The Nanny might be some of the best in tv history.
Cheer,“There’s terrorists in my stomach and they’re demanding beer.”
Cheer,"It's an ""applause"" sign, not a ""laugh"" sign."
Cheer,They used to come installed on every television set too.
Cheer,The cynicism of people thinking everything is canned laughter is so annoying
Cheer,They still used laugh track overlays even with a live studio audience to fill it out. Most of those sets only had an audience of 30-50 people at most
Cheer,But how is someone - someone whose only experience with Cheers ever is this clip - supposed to know that “Cheers is filmed before a live studio audience” /s
Cheer,"“But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.”"
Cheer,Took me a second.  Robin Hood Men in Tights.
La bella y las bestias,"2 of your major complaints have more to do with your inabilities than the show itself.

Your inability to read subtitles has nothing to do with the show. It's like an ESL person complaining there's too much subtitles to read when watching The Community.

Equally, your inability to distinguish between the women has nothing to do with the show. Granted, I couldn't tell couple of them apart as well in the beginning (but this happens a lot when I first start a show) but it didn't take long until I could tell them apart and they really don't look that similar.

&#x200B;

I did not get the sense that it promised us an adventurous girls trip. This seems to be an assumption you made then got fixated on? They are a bunch of girls who go on a vacation together; partying, doing drugs, walking around town, chilling on a boat etc, sound about right to me. This isn't some fantasy show where they go on to slay dragons.

Cancer and doing challenges with your best friends? To me it was obvious from the get go that it's a show about self-discoveries. But it really doesn't matter whether my assumption was correct or not because it has nothing to do with the quality of the show.

&#x200B;

I don't think it's even important to know who has cancer. The writer even told us this by showing us how the show could end if it is revealed that a specific character had cancer at the beginning of episode 6.  I would have been ok even if it remained vague. This isn't a mystery ""find the person with cancer!"" show where you go back and see what clues you've missed.

&#x200B;

edit: wording and grammar."
La bella y las bestias,Couldn’t have said it better myself
La bella y las bestias,"I agree completely. And to add: this is a VERY rare show that has moments that actually makes me ""real"" laugh (like I'm in on the joke and not laughing AT the characters), and had a great portrayal of friendships, and one of the LEAST fake drug experiences. I truly loved this. Even though I binge watch a lot on Netflix, I tend to play some game after a bit in background because there's a bit of irritation at taking too long to get to the point, but in this case I enjoyed the journey, and loved it. I also love that it didn't feel like anything else to me. 

I do admit two things though: one, that for first 2 episodes, I kept confusing the 2 married women, but it was easy to sort their faces as I got to know them better; and two, that i did very mildly try to guess which had cancer, and first thoughts were correct, but it thankfully really wasnt treated as a mystery or important to story. 

I think I'll rewatch in original Spanish versus the dubbing to better get idea of tones and voices of each woman."
La bella y las bestias,"Yes! The way I see it OP didn't get the show because they went in with completely different expectations. There is nothing to get or expect from it but just enjoy the time you have with the characters. Most of the time I just wanted to be there, sit next to them and talk about nothing and everything and that's the beauty of it. 

Though i do admit that 3 of the characters looked extremely alike with their head shaven but that is in no way a minus point and more of a fun observation."
La bella y las bestias,">however. There’s a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom

They bring this up as a negative point but I really loved that in the first couple of seasons of GoT."
La bella y las bestias,[deleted]
La bella y las bestias,"Rolling stones is interesting and one I really see as a positive. I hope theres more focus on politics, intrigue and dialogue. Season 1-3 were the highlight of the original series (and books) for that reason. 

Also the problem that the quotable/witty characters might be a blessing in disguise. The show ended up destroying itself and those characters because they became beholden and flanderised based on those lines/subsequent popularity. Tyrion in particular."
La bella y las bestias,"When the negative reviews are ""too much dialogue"" I'm in."
La bella y las bestias,Am I the only one struggling to see any inherently negative points in a lot of these negative reviews?
La bella y las bestias,"I am cautiously optimistic 

There are a few things that I’m apprehensive about though. Succession filled the void GoT left behind of a political power struggle with many moving pieces that managed to be far more grounded than GoT. House of the Dragon has to live up to both it and GoT in that regard in my opinion 

Another aspect is that I really preferred the production of GoT in its earlier seasons where it managed to do a lot with what was available. Later seasons felt like they went big for the sake of it which I felt made GoT lose some of its charm and HotD seems to be closer to later GoT in terms of production 

I really hope it delivers tbh"
La bella y las bestias,I am not surprised that Milly Alcock gets some praise here. Even in just the trailers you can see she has some great charisma and presence. I wonder if her older replacement will be able to keep up with her performance.
La bella y las bestias,"The only thing I can conclude from these, is that, most random reviewers just aren't worth listening to. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking the same approach with this and the Lord of the Rings TV show - my expectations are going to be set so god damn low, that it's almost impossible that I could be let down. 

&#x200B;

Narrator voice: ""He was later let down in dramatic fashion"""
La bella y las bestias,"I'd say we should go in with managed expectations. As far as I'm aware, the source material is sort of like a history book more than a novel. 

When GoT show overtook the ASOIAF books, there was a significant noticeable drop in writing quality. Characters started acting more petulant and dialogue became mostly juvenile.

I really do hope this show is a return to form though. But most fantasy live action in the last few years has turned out absolutely abysmal."
La bella y las bestias,"Critic reviews for TV are much less important than those for movies. Because critics only judge a TV show based on a couple of episodes, their reviews are  always missing the entire picture. Unlike a movie which is experienced fully and therefore you have a much better understanding of the product.

TV shows are a much longer commitment and therefore your true score will only come over time as your brain digests the material to a fuller extent.

GoT had some middling pre-reviews for S1 as well. It was only after the entire season had finished that some critics went back and thought ""Y,know what? That was actually pretty good!""

I always give a whole season for a show to find it's footing.

Edit: The truly damaging review comes from Slate Magazine and it was done by a game reviewer. Awful choice and makes me disregard the review, even if it was positive. Video games are a more action-packed medium and this is a more ponderous story."
La bella y las bestias,"Saw it on Wednesday thanks to Tiff in Toronto. I absolutely loved it. Now, it’s a great pilot, but the next two episodes will really show if its got legs. Personally, I think its a very promising first episode, the writing, acting and directing was very strong. Plus, its a fucking great looking show with no comparison (some weaker cgi here and there but great compared to other shows). 

I was so ready to be done with the show and go back to rereading the books, but now i’m excited for Sunday again.

Plus, it feels like GoT, the politics, the intrigue, the danger… and I think the story they picked will work really well for TV."
La bella y las bestias,"I’m super excited, not gunna lie."
La bella y las bestias,"Saw the first ep on Wednesday. I think it is going to be decent. However, people need to give it a chance with an open mind. I'd probably still watch anything GoT related that came out anyways, but I'm sure there are some people who are really bitter of how the show ended and are reluctant to give this a go. Really excited for Matt Smith as Daemon."
La bella y las bestias,"I know it all depends on the execution, but the mixed reviews talk about the focus on the politics of the kingdom and sitting around tables debating as if they werent the most engaging parts of early GoT. That being said, those scenes may be poorly put to screen in House of Dragon, will find out soon enough."
La bella y las bestias,"Should I even watch this if I’ve never watched Game of Thrones?. The ending scared me off, but I am interested in this new one."
La bella y las bestias,"I see a trend when somewhat middling reviews start to appear for a soon-to-release popular property. Redditors start to pick apart those middling reviews, saying things like, ""The critic has a problem with *that*?! Ridiculous! That particular nitpick is what I *love* about the property!""

But when the dust settles, the critics are rarely wrong. A show that gets middling critic reviews is almost always middling. That doesn't mean it will be *bad*, and that doesn't mean it won't *improve*. 

But, I'm definitely going into this show with lowered expectations. Hopefully it will be halfway decent."
La bella y las bestias,"From the reviews here and the comments, it seems like people don't understand that this too is a book? A history book, to be exact. Reviewers and commenters are making statements as if the show runners came up with the story."
La bella y las bestias,"[Slant: A Frustrating Jumble of Incident and Spectacle](https://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/house-of-the-dragon-review/)

> House of the Dragon must really believe its own claim that “the truth does not matter, only perception,” for it ultimately is more interested in fan service—offering up more dragons, more gore, more surprise murders, a more expensive historical re-enactment—than it is in developing scenes that ring true for its characters. Game of Thrones veterans like director Miguel Sapochnik and composer Ramin Djawadi can make this new series look and sound like more of the same, but it’s as hollow and brittle as the massive scale model of the kingdom that Viserys takes pride in building. That’s a rotten foundation for an epic fantasy, so maybe the prophecy was correct after all: the only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon was itself.

[Empire: The writing so far lacks the sparkle of Game Of Thrones' most profound moments.](https://www.empireonline.com/tv/reviews/house-of-the-dragon-season-1/)

>For all its po-faced plotting, this show has plenty going for it. A decade time-jump in episode six, recasting several characters, gives the series a new energy; D’Arcy and Olivia Cooke (as the troubled Queen Alicent Hightower) breathe new dimensions into their aged-up characters, and the sudden switch-up suggests a show unafraid to take risks. This is a prequel that could surprise us yet. But to even skirt the heights of Thrones’ best work, it has an uphill dragon ride ahead.

[Indiewire: HBO’s Devout ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Rarely Roars to Life](https://www.indiewire.com/2022/08/house-of-dragon-review-got-prequel-1234752881/)

>Co-showrunners Miguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal, along with co-creators Condal and George R.R. Martin, make misogyny’s destructive influence the series’ central theme, but it’s more of a convenient shield than a piercing dagger. After all, this is a prequel to “Game of Thrones”; where Westeros ends up has already been set. Learning its past isn’t far removed from its future is both part of the point — feigning interest in how the medieval fantasy’s patriarchal power structures and boastful man-babies mirror modern day’s similar problems — and a safe path for the network’s first spinoff of its highest-grossing franchise. The first six episodes set up an intimate yet epic tale of how misbegotten pride, outdated customs, and an obsession with power burned down a long-thriving kingdom… all while enjoying the ensuing ugliness more than they examine its unnecessary proliferation. Pure spectacle and (often icky) soap opera make for intermittently absorbing TV. Mainly though, the new “House” sticks safely to the “Game” that preceded it, rather than fight for any meaningful change."
La bella y las bestias,"Meh - looking at what critics are choosing to praise here, I've slightly downgraded my expectations."
La bella y las bestias,"so, tons of childbirth scenes, THE STRUGGLE

&#x200B;

will still watch, though, because I'm bored"
La bella y las bestias,">Rolling Stone had a negative take, noting, “Palace intrigue, and questions of succession and legitimacy, were of course a huge part of Game of Thrones, but far from the only part. And they were only sometimes even close to the most fun part of a given stretch of that series.

Sepinwall enjoyed Game of Thrones for far different reasons than I did, it seems."
La bella y las bestias,[deleted]
La bella y las bestias,"I think people are too laser focused on what they perceive the review is I don't think they are complaining that politics are always boring, but rather that the show lacks in other areas that GoT didn't. There was plenty of political intrigue there but also lots of hillarious moments intersped with it, you could have Varys doing spy master stuff learning about everyone's position on matters and then have him discuss court gossip and marveling at the tales of Podrick's amazing sexual powers. 

Hopefully it isn't like that and the show's tone is more complex and not just FIRE AND BLOOD, non-stop. Even Tywin relaxed from time to time."
La bella y las bestias,Any idea if I need to have seen GoT to watch this show?
La bella y las bestias,"A big problem this show will have is that it can't be all things to all people like Game of Thrones did. GoT is like a diner that has a little of everything (burgers, chicken tenders, shrimp, quesadillas, etc.) while House of the Dragon is like a seafood restaurant (depending on your preference, one is better than the other). With GoT, there were plenty of people who said they only watched for the political intrigue or dragons or white walkers or Dany or Arya or Jon or the battles or the magic or a particular actor or actress or large scope or large number of characters or to root for certain characters to die, etc. House of th Dragon has some of that stuff but not all it it so it would be nearly impossible for it to be as big of a show as GoT (even if they season 8 had been incredible). They only way it could would be if it could get new people. Also, I hear GoT was the highest watched show for HBO in 2021 despite the bad ending and it being 2 years after it ending so that's a little hope for this show."
La bella y las bestias,"> however. There’s a lot of sitting around tables and talking about the troubles of the kingdom  

That is exactly what I'm here for. I can go plenty of places and get high flying wizardry and sword fighting. *The Crown* is fucking awesome, and it has zero dragons, sword fighting, or wizardry. 

I thought it was a great pilot episode, it didn't try to be GoT *exactly*, while still feeling like GoT (to me at least). GoT was a generational phenomenon, and impossible to recreate 1:1. Any attempt to do that would likely fail based on probability alone. 

I like the fact the show might be more concentrated. Sometimes GoT felt way too sprawling, and characters were moving around the map at breakneck speeds, especially towards the end where the scale of westeros really shrank.  

I thought the cgi could be cleaned up some in a few shots, but nothing too egregious. Some really great acting performances also.  

I usually love an underdog, so I think I'm gonna be team princess. I always wondered what Henry VIII would have done if he had just realized that one of the most influential monarchs in English and even world history was sitting right under his nose, so it was really fun for me to see a monarch do exactly that in this episode, even if it was a pretend one. Can't help but wonder if GRRM has the same question."
La bella y las bestias,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens compared to the more expansive scope of the original series:

the show is literally named ""house of dragons"" why was this person expecting stories of baratheons and starks?"
La bella y las bestias,"THR review has to be a meme.

Show is called House of the Dragon

Gets mad that it focuses on Targaryen Family"
La bella y las bestias,I just wanna see /r/freefolk implode if it's good
La bella y las bestias,"I'm going to say something that will bother many: if it wasn't for HBO, the reviewers ratings would be much worse."
La bella y las bestias,RollingStone points out the reason I've been so apprehensive about this show -- too much palace intrigue and not enough common folk stories from the wider world to ground the whole thing.
La bella y las bestias,[deleted]
La bella y las bestias,"Yeah I don’t know if people will ever get over the awful ending and return to the GOT universe. I can guarantee that this show will never even touch the ratings that GOT had back in its prime. Maybe it will start to pick up traction in a few seasons, but I think we all are still a bit scarred and this was too soon if you ask me"
La bella y las bestias,"These reviews don’t inspire confidence in me - someone who wanted a reason to be pulled back into the show other than just “it’s more GoT and more dragons.”

I expected more quality from this show tbh."
La bella y las bestias,">yet opined that the show is weighed down by focusing on the Targaryens

You're telling me House of the Dragon is focusing on the house whose sigil is dragons and who owns dragons??!

*shocked pikachu face*"
La bella y las bestias,"Whatever, call me when it's done. If they don't screw it up, then I'll watch it."
La bella y las bestias,"Idk if it's cause the last season or two of GoT turned me off to it so much or what, but the trailers didn't make me want to watch"
La bella y las bestias,"93% on RT so far, can’t wait"
La bella y las bestias,*fart*
La bella y las bestias,Looks like it’s worth the watch and a palette cleanser for that last season of GOT
La bella y las bestias,Is it even worth watching if i've never seen GoT?
La bella y las bestias,[deleted]
La bella y las bestias,I was interested in watching it so I rewatched all of GOT and remembered why I'm done with the series all together. I hope you guys find enjoyment where I find pain lol....

La bella y las bestias,"I have faith that it will be good, but as long as it just doesn’t suck I’ll be fine."
La bella y las bestias,"Grace said it’s good so it must be, I’m very excited, cannot wait for it to drop

Plus seems like GOT meets Succession, and as a fan of both I’m sure it’ll be fun"
La bella y las bestias,How much of the season have these reviewers seen? Always feel weird to judge something that isn't whole yet.
La bella y las bestias,It’s to big to fail….. they will talk about how great it is till we think it is. Hopefully it will be….. see already starting to work!
La bella y las bestias,I prolly only watching this for Matt Smith.
La bella y las bestias,"No matter what anyone else says, the show is still gonna be ""tainted"" by the slap-in-the-face GOT ending. I'm still pissed."
La bella y las bestias,"I'm not super excited about this. I'll watch it though.

Tyrion related and hung out with and plotted with the lower classes. The Stark kids went off in different directions— pampered nobility that were suddenly fish out of water. Jon went to the Wall and mixed with many types of characters. It was the mix of characters that made the aSoIaF books and GoT show good.

  
I'm sure they'll throw in some stories of castle staff and other lower class characters. But so far this looks like it's the adventures of a bunch of millionaires and billionaires (relative to our world) and that could get dry pretty quickly.

  
(I'm also in the weirdo minority who doesn't much like the dragons and dragon riding stuff. I love the dark magic that births them in aSoIaF. But then they grow up to be basically titanic lizards. Nothing really magical about them at all. They even need to eat herds of cattle just to survive—which would make them a huge drain on resources. Liabilities.)"
La bella y las bestias,[deleted]
La bella y las bestias,"Rolling Stone also panned Led Zeppelin’s first album, among many other highly acclaimed albums so I’ll just take that one with a grain of salt."
La bella y las bestias,"I watched every episode of GoT, first because it seemed interesting and then because of its storied beginnings I thought it could somehow redeem itself. What memory offers now is an absolute  grimoire of grisly ideas papered over by the moniker ""fantasy TV"". Women having their babies cut out of their wombs, castration and humiliation, death drowning in molten metal, having to learn to fight through sudden blindness, a talking gallery of decapitated heads, some sort of creeping disease, death by being pulled apart by dogs, being tricked into eating your relative baked into a pie, casual, ritual, near constant rapes. Spoiler -- mostly everybody dies. And then at the end the actors of this monstrosity could barely phone it in and started leaving their coffee cups and water bottles on sets as they were being filmed. 

Doesn't matter what anyone says. \*Never again\*, GoT; over here we finally understood we the audience were being terrorized."
La bella y las bestias,No more misogyny….I’m out
La bella y las bestias,"Yeah if I got paid to go to the big opening and review I'd say nice shit too, so I could go to the next big opening"
La bella y las bestias,All the people saying this franchise was dead after season 8 are delusional. Most of the reviews are positive; this show is going to be a *huge* hit.
La bella y las bestias,"Even negatives seems to be my cup of tea honestly.   


In the end, I'm here for the politicking and dragons and it seems that is what we will get."
La bella y las bestias,Most of the critics are things specifically said to be about the show (like too many Targaryens lol) and being upset about the things that made GoT great.
La bella y las bestias,reviews seem solid enough but i feel like there is a gap for rings of power to slide into that could take over the public consciousness.
La bella y las bestias,"Matt smith has one of the worst faces in Hollywood, and seeing him with that silly wig on he goes from being a 5 or 6 head to being 95% forehead. Not since MTVs the head, has anyone on TV had so much forehead."
La bella y las bestias,After GoT I honestly can not bother with this show. I stopped the books and can’t bother with a spin off.
La bella y las bestias,The show now lies around 85% on RT. Which is good news.
La bella y las bestias,"Trying…to not….get….HYPEEED!!!

But I am now! It’s too late. Time to pull out The World of Ice & Fire!!"
La bella y las bestias,"No matter what, I am going to wait for this show to end, even if it is going to be 10 seasons. Only if in the end it will be declared worth watching I am going to. GOT has been such a monumental delusion from season 6 to 8 that I am not risking that waste such a large portion of my life for garbage."
La bella y las bestias,"Does Matt Smith need to get a new agent? He's finally getting more work after Doctor Who but all as dour characters or villains without personality or at least appearing in movies and tv that's getting shit on for it, minus the Crown, which he was still a Dour Danny in, or Pouting Phillip I guess"
La bella y las bestias,Would take the guardian review with a grain of salt. Lucy Mangan is incapable of objective critique.
La bella y las bestias,I cannot fathom why anyone would watch this after HBO fucked up GoT the first time.
La bella y las bestias,"I just can't be bothered to care even if I wanted to (ABOUT REVIEWS/WATCHING THE SHOW if that wasn't obvious...I obviously care about expressing how I feel about this show). It's a prequel. A prequel to a terrible and worthless ending. Why care? Even if it gets 10/10 all around, it's a pass for me. Sorry.

Not to mention if I watched it, all I'd be thinking about in the back of my mind is the depressing ending. No ty.

[edit]: where were all you downvoting GoT gawkers after the show ended the way it did? lmao.  keep downvoting me for an opinion you know millions of people share."
La bella y las bestias,Is the show out already? I thought it was airing this Sunday?!?
La bella y las bestias,Why do these snippets feel like they’re written with less thought and care than your run-of-the-mill Reddit comment?
La bella y las bestias,How many episodes did they get to review?
La bella y las bestias,WE THE FANS ARE SUCKERS. George should have finished wind's of winter before doing any other projects. HBO ruined the ending passing George's progress and before he dies he owes US LOYAL FANS the ending we all know he wants to give us. How much money do you need at 70? The biggest heartbreak will be him not completing his life's work...then what some ghost writer gives us more of the same?  I watched the show. I know the history George outlined in the targaryens lives... I'm like you. A fan. I've read all the books...3000 pages x 5 plus. And I read them 4 times... so enjoy the show.. but don't forget... WE ARE OWED for our loyalty.
La bella y las bestias,"""Medical Horror"", I agree. What is the point of the super graphic birth? It was a c-section done archaically, we get it, mom and baby die. No need for the overly grotesque? It seriously made me uncomforatble and added nothing to the end result."
La bella y las bestias,"The premiere of this show was actually serviceably entertaining. In spite of the table conferences of the characters, this show seemed faster-paced than the old show. Maybe it’s because Benioff and Weiss are no longer involved.

A lot of fans have been miffed with George Martin recently over various things, like not working on the last books of the series and especially over his calling his audience names if they express exasperation with him. But none of that was enough to keep viewers, even the angry ones, away from the premiere, which did very well in the ratings. The bottom line is that people always need something to watch. And I guess they really do go for prequels, because they like stuff they are familiar with. There was never going to be any “boycott” of George Martin. People don’t really care about entertainment politics, it’s not important enough to care about. They endlessly gab about it on the Internet, which sometimes makes it seem important. It’s mostly hot air and venting that doesn’t reflect reality."
La bella y las bestias,"The show’s just trying too hard for nothing. There is sex and gore just to be there, trying to compensate for the drama that the writers cannot create to fill up the time between canon events and dialogue."
La bella y las bestias,I'm really liking this. First episode was great on my books.  I hope hate doesn't get this cancelled
La bella y las bestias,House of the Dragons is unbearably boring. I can't stand watching these disgusting Targaryen's bicker back and forth and that's all there is to see folks. BORING
La bella y las bestias,"One review “Sitting around doing nothing”, another review “fast pace” you can never tell with reviews"
La bella y las bestias,"I love the politicking of the earlier seasons but they were brilliant because we were invested in Ned Stark, Tyrion, Cersei etc. that it mattered to us. The murder mystery in Season 1, the looming invasion of Stannis on King's Landing, the built up to Red Wedding all worked because we were invested in various players on all sides of the game."
La bella y las bestias,"Depends how well they establish stakes and the relationships between characters. Having Tywin and Tyrion in the same room was always tense and had me at the edge of my seat.

I’m very hopeful that they create some compelling characters like the original series"
La bella y las bestias,Totally agree but it only works if you have characters enjoyable enough to sit around with. The critics complaining about this mostly say the characters are bland as well. Who knows I’m still excited!
La bella y las bestias,"Not enough dick jokes. Truly those are a sign of prestige television.

4/10."

La bella y las bestias,The first time watching GOT you don’t pick up on it. The 2nd time you realize how much info is actually in the “sitting down and talking” scenes
La bella y las bestias,"Most of the quieter, slower-paced moments from the earlier seasons were character centric, not really expositing about the politics of the realm"
La bella y las bestias,Tywin & Arya's scene around a table is one of the most memorable highlights of GoT acting that i think of frequently

La bella y las bestias,"The Small Council ""musical chairs"" scene from Season 3, which is dialogue free until Tyrion shows up, is absolutely brilliant and wordlessly shows the viewer the personalities and characterization of everyone involved."
La bella y las bestias,"It looks like most of the negative reviews come from people who, for one reason or another, don't like the actual palace intrigue and the politics of GOT and were apparently watching it for different reasons. They're all on a similar line"
La bella y las bestias,Also the reason I loved shows like Succession. It was all just backstabbing and scheming.
La bella y las bestias,"Guess they didn't like Mad Men, either? Some of the best TV dramas are ""sitting around tables and talking""."
La bella y las bestias,"They also call the characters flat but like...it's presumably only the first episode? Probably a lot of time to round them out, the original GoT episode 1 had a lot of flatness as well if I recall correctly."

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"> Italy’s 2,500 dubbing industry workers are on a protracted strike demanding higher wages, less frenzied work conditions, and protection against digital dubbing devices, which they claim threaten their jobs.


> The country’s unions representing Italian voice actors and dubbing directors have been on the war path since Feb. 21. On Tuesday they announced the strike will continue for at least another week.


> The unions are demanding that standard contract wages that have remained unvaried for the past 15 years be raised. But they are also clamoring for the right to be able to work at a slower pace, claiming that “current production rhythms are not conducive to [good] quality of work and of life,” according to a statement issued by Italian dubbers’ union ANAD. 


For people who might be wondering about 'Andor' thumbnail..


> Bianchi, a voice actor, is the regular Italian voice of international stars including Stellan Skarsgård. He most recently featured in the “Star Wars” series “Andor.” Bianchi said the time crunch prompted by more Hollywood movies going out day-and-date along with the increase in product that needs to be dubbed for the Italian market have been causing “an insane work rhythm where it’s impossible to maintain our quality standards that have been steadily deteriorating for a long time.”


> Italy, where local audiences until recently rejected subtitles en masse, “once stood out around the world for the level of excellence of its dubbing quality,” said Bianchi who as a dubbing director recently oversaw the Italian version of Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans.” “We want to work better, with more time at our disposal,” he noted."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"A few years and AI will be able to completely translate movies with the voice of original actors. Good luck fighting for higher salary against a cheaper and more reliable option.

One of the first casualilty, AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"This will be a hard fight for them, Italians speak with their hands too."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"I’m not very optimistic on this issue. The Luddite movement wasn’t able to secure any kind of job security, this won’t be any different."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Is the tech good enough to replace them yet? I was under the impression it was close but not quite there yet.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"They haven't seen anything yet, with deepfake video/audio technology, in 10\~20 years you will have on demand dubbing in actors voices and with lip-syncing."

Why Obsidian uses AI voices for game development



This is terrifying"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,AI making music. AI making posters. AI doing translations. It does seem like AI could end up taking over everything. Does that really benefit humans though? Maybe the rich executives. But everyone else? It seems like there should be limits on this.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Saw some article the other day taking about AI screenwriting, but AI can't generate ideas. To me, this is the real threat to writers - all of the non glamorous, non creative work. The day jobs. And not just for writers either, there are going to be hundreds of people who get put out of work because the computer can do it now. What will a day job look like in the future? Will everyone even be able to get one?"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"That's just the direction we are going though. Why would I want to pay someone for one job when I can buy a program and have it do all types of jobs for me forever? 

Imagine how much we could get done. 3D printing for construction, automated vehicles, ai for education and a wide range of other things. 

Honestly there's no turning back."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"We need to start enacting some form of measures to protect jobs regardless of how good AI is at doing them. I’m in support of protests like these. So long as we’re going to live in a capitalist world and jobs are going to be necessary, we need to take steps to protect them. People think AI taking jobs will happen slowly and will be resolved by it miraculously creating new jobs. This is only somewhat true. It will create *some* new jobs, but overwhelmingly it will delete entire career paths and this threatens to *massively* destabilize global economy. Companies and governments need to start enacting policies to protect those jobs or OTHERWISE abandon a capitalist system and start developing an infrastructure that can support people who can not work because of their job being replaced"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Oh wow, it’s almost like AI has no place in creative fields and will only realistically be used to screw over actually talented *people* because it’s cheaper.

What a goddamn surprise."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Yeah idk if not working is the solution to stop something that’s taking their jobs. But I side with the dubbers. It’s inevitable that studios will choose the cheaper option, but the use of AI needs legislation and fast. Either through taxation or general devaluing if AI is involved, something like a limiting MSRP on AI involvement, the free market never corrects things for the betterment of the disenfranchised. If it’s cheaper to produce, it should be cheaper to consume."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"And typesetters lost their minds when digital printing gutted the industry. 

Good luck with that boys, you're better off looking for your next career than chasing the scraps of the last one."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Video killed the radio star...
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"It sucks, I hate that AI just happened and all of sudden millions of people’s jobs are threatened. We need legislation to protect workers from AI and to limit the reach of AI products. Otherwise we’re going to lose a lot of potential creatives who are going to give up before they even start."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,I remember when I heard the story of elevator operators going on strike when the automatic elevator with buttons was invented and being installed in select places. Going in strike like this might make their jobs more obsolete

Go! Go! Cory Carson,The dubbing industry sounds like they are reading actuarial tables. I would rather just read the closed captioning than listen to the dubbers deliver the lines without any emotion.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"It’s shocking people only discussing this now, this has been a long time coming as we have seen automation take over. But I guess those in the creative industries thought they would be immune and didn’t care. Now it’s too late and their loosing their jobs"

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"The help doth protest too much, methinks"

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"The absolute worst thing about this thread is that there are people saying that's it's ok, just another obsolete job to be replaced. All hail the progress. Just like horses and cars, right?

In which universe is listening to a robotic soulless voice better than enjoying the emotions conveyed by a real human? Just because it's cheaper and faster? I don't care how good the AI gets, as a human I want to see and listen to other humans. I crave human connection, and I want humans to tell me their stories and feelings through media. I don't care what a machine spews out, no matter how good it is, because it is a fucking machine.

How much do you have to hate yourself to be ok with that on a personal level"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Dubbing should just be stopped. Unless it's kids shows.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"i kind of feel this is like mathematicians going on strike because someone invented the calculator, ai is a tool, not a replacement, and at the end of the day the world doesn't give a shit if ur out of a job if it means easier and more effective means of getting shit done, dont get upset because the world is changing and you are becoming obsolete, adapt or die its simple evolution"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"There goong to be jobs replaced by AI, that just what it is."

Go! Go! Cory Carson,As someone who is Italian and has worked in the Italian dubbing industry: they are pathetic. Hope they'll start looking into new careers :)
Go! Go! Cory Carson,VO actors go on strike against AI? Sounds like a perfect time to double down on AI!
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Hey guys, if you really want to see and hear something more interesting Italian or want to create italian video by using dubbing software use https://wavel.ai/solutions/dubbing/"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Sounds to me like Hollywood just needs to get copies of work prints out to these dubbing studios earlier to prevent the last minute crunch that seems to be plaguing them.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,They also not being paid since months
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Aye yes.  Convince your employers to not use machines by making your own labor more expensive to use.  What could possibly go wrong
Go! Go! Cory Carson,So It sounds like automation can help lighten the load so they don’t work as much?
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Who cares. Italians, just use subtitles like normal people"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"There are already demos out there of software that can not only output text in the original actors’s voice but also change lip movement to match.  In ten years, dubbing will likely be a dead occupation."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"A lot of streaming services already use machine translations for subtitles, and the result is often absolute trash; sloppy, mistranslations and mixing up words, direct translation of idioms, etc.  
  
Just yesterday I saw one show on D+ translate ""headshot"" into the ""shot in the head"" meaning rather than the ""photography used in the entertainment business"" meaning, saying a guy had shot his cat in the head many times (""he has many headshots of his cat""), which changed the tone of the scene rather drastically."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Yep. I'm a writer for a fortune 50 and pump out press releases, been doing it for ten years now. If I'm already testing AI to make by own job easier, you can bet your ass that my days are numbered.

These guys are pretty foolish to believe they're going to win this cause."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,UBI
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Needed? No.

Should still exist? Absolutely. 

AI has no place in the creative fields and only braindead techbros think otherwise."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,">AI will change many industries and people will learn that automated work means that their works is not needed anymore.

People have been learning that continuously for centuries now, only difference here is that this is the first time ever that creatives are being bitten on the ass and they are doing what they do best: making drama out of the whole thing"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Luddites are actually a surprisingly apt analogy. Like these workers, they weren't against the machines themselves, they targeted companies that used machines to skirt labor laws. We have a lot better worker's rights now though so fingers crossed for this union. AI is like other tools in that it can be used inhumanely or horrifically, that's up to us."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,It requires training data and many new contracts are including the stipulation to use the VA’s lines in that data set.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"It can't match human quality, but it's decent enough in many cases that bottom-line companies will go with that since it's vastly faster and cheaper. 

If you read ""AI""-translated stuff, it's generally about ~~80%~~ 90% ~~indistinguishable~~ raises no eyebrows, 9% correct but reads a little weird, and 1% things that are just not accurate or that haven't translated properly. For an exec or someone who is more concerned with the bottom line than conveying the spirit of the text, that's usually good enough. The problem then becomes, are enough people willing to pay for that extra level of quality to sustain an industry? The programs are being trained on the work of translators, but those translators are not seeing economic benefit from it. They are, in a sense, competing with their past work in a system where the bottom line is all-too-frequently the final word.

Economic concerns aside, the real killer is that iterative learning will always (at least so far as I've seen) favor textual fidelity over the voice of the text, and doesn't have the ability to make executive decisions based on outside knowledge. One of the benefits of a really good translator is that they understand the stuff that isn't being said, the metatext of language that accompanies and accentuates our diction and syntax. For example, *Les Misérables* (which has been translated into English at least 4 times, and possibly as many as 8 depending on how derivative a work can be before being considered its own translation) was written in the vernacular French of the mid-19th century. Victor Hugo was intentionally writing for a universal audience, but by modern standards his prose would be considered significantly elevated (in no small part because the style of writing he used became seen as respectable thanks to his work). One issue that translators have grappled with is, where do you split that difference? (Notably, Hugo hated the first (Wilbur) translation of the novel, he is reported to have declared upon reading it that ""translation is censorship."")

Of the translations, the three I want to look at are Norman Denny (1976), Julie Rose (2007), and Christine Donougher (2013). These are generally agreed to be the best available (fun fact, an 1863 edition had the anti-slavery parts excised so it could be sold to Confederate soldiers during the Civil War!) and anyone looking to read Les Mis in English is generally steered towards one of them. (Maybe less so Denny these days, but of the 20th-century translations his is the best-regarded)

However, they have vastly different approaches to the language and structure of the story. Denny chose to make editorial alterations to language and remove parts he considered irrelevant to the overall story being told, an interesting choice considering Victor Hugo's insistence upon the importance of his digressions. He favored an ""old-feeling"" voice, to make the novel feel its age. [The opening page as per Denny, including a somewhat representative phrase:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-denny-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was said of him that his father, intending him to inherit his office, had arranged for him to marry at a very early age, about eighteen or twenty, following the custom that was fairly widespread in parliamentary families.""

Rose, by contrast, kept everything in but ""modernized"" the language, stating that she wanted it to feel to a reader like they were relating to the text in the same way that a 19th-century French reader would have. [Her first page, with the same line quoted below:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-rose-les-miserables-1.png)

>They reckoned his father had put him down to inherit his position and so had married him off very early in the piece when he was only eighteen or twenty, as they used to do quite a lot in parliamentary families.

Donougher seeks to find a middle ground, updating the cadence to be accessible to readers without using the same level of explicitly modern language. [Her introduction to the bishop, and that same line:](https://welovetranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/extract-donougher-les-miserables-1.png)

>It was reported that his father, intending that his son should inherit his position, had married him off very young, aged eighteen or twenty, a fairly common practice among parliamentary families.

The same information is being conveyed in all three of these, but the voice of the translator is evident.

Now, imagine you want to do an ""AI""-driven translation of Les Mis. How on earth do you begin to parse this? Do you train it exclusively on French from the 19th century? Exclusively on Hugo? Do you feed it every Les Mis translation we have, or the collected works of a single translator? Issues of ownership aside (and I would argue that any translator would have very solid grounds for legal action if their translations were used to create a new translation that did not include them in profit-sharing), the voices are not just divergent, but actively trying to do different things, and no program can even come close to matching that."

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"It's depressing because instead of being democratic and making all of our lives easier, AI seems to already be going to direction of empowering corporations over people and fortifying their grip on people's time and labor.

Time is the most valuable resource any of us have, and yet the vast majority of people have been losing it while the elite few reap the value of that time, turning it into more money than they could spend in many life times."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Terrifying? More like fascinating.

They use it in the stage of the game where it would be economically impossible to use real voice actors. When you are creating the dialogues and doing tons of re-writes and all kinds of changes... you cannot have the whole cast of VAs behind your back reading the lines. But now with AI the writer can actually hear what they are writing with the correct expression and emotion.

Also, it's fascinating that the AI voice company in the video chose a route that still gets the VAs involved paid. Noone is losing anything in this scenario. Only gaining."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Why is this terrifying? It doesn’t seem like a bad thing to me.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"i think it sounds like shit, honestly. if i had heard it without knowing what it was, i would be remarking on how crap these voice actors are."

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"I don't think I'd want to watch an AI created series even if it's good. Who knows though, maybe that will change. I wouldn't want to buy AI artwork either because it loses all appeal to me. Maybe as a wallpaper but that's about it.

Wonder if that will be the popular opinion going forward or not."

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Good luck with that. 

The advent of useful AI systems is no different than the mass adoption of the internet. It will be disruptive, some people will lose their jobs, but entire new industries will arise that nobody has yet even conceived. 

The sun will rise in the east, babies will be born, things will go on."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Ai creative writing continues to be disappointing and soulless. The only worry I have is if people fall for the astroturf and fake pr campaigns that accompanies the shitty writing.
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"I can’t believe that in the first year of having AI, the main things I’ve heard it threatening are artistic fields… art, music etc… the one thing that I thought wouldn’t be able to be emulated by a robot.    
Where are the robots taking real estate, banking, finance, law and management jobs!"
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"it's pretty much already too later. There's a ton of communities generating thousands if millions of high quality AI art. and it's only getting better. it really does suck.

one thing though is that it does have to learn styles and you can tell a ton of it is pulling heavily from just a few dozen or less styles. Like a ton of it just seems like it's drawn by the same person.

And even when you take AI out of the equation, Chinese ""artists"" have been tracing real artists for decades and selling it as original art. They for example, will trace art of Sailor Moon and change the hair to make it look like Misty from Pokemon and copy the painting style and then make 5+ variants of that artwork with Misty in different stages of undress.

But then thing is they do this in a sweat shop type setting where they have dozens of people churning out these traced drawings every month and they're all pretending to be one person, typically a pretending to be a girl to get more willing supporters that'll pay ""her"" a lot of money because they know people are more likely donate to a female artist than a male artist who draws quality NSFW art.

It's no different from the AI art. AI makes it worse, maybe...I'm sure there are people selling AI art as if they're making it themselves, but it'd be pretty impossible to fool other people who just use it as a hobby, which a lot of these communities do. From what I've seen, they like using it make stuff they want to see...which might seem obvious, but most don't seem to be using it for any business reasons. Seems to be a lot of it's done for a laugh and...of course...porn. Some really questionable porn (as in deep fake type of stuff where they have the AI make nude paintings of celebrities) and less questionable, of their favorite cartoon characters. 


It's probably really gonna suck in like 10 years when people can more easily do it. Right now, installing that stuff and figuring out how to run it is hard for the average person, so you have to spend money monthly using websites or use free websites that do it for you, but they're limited.

Eventually one of these people is gonna make a user friendly version...maybe...they seem to be completely unable or unwilling to do that which might be for the better I guess...and a lot of the people who like to post AI art that ""they create"" are unwilling to share how they create it because they want to remain unique and special. If everyone starts ""making"" AI art, they wont feel special anymore. So it's being held back to some extent at least...but...yeah, it's already at a point where it makes really great looking images and wide spread."

Go! Go! Cory Carson,"That's been happening for several year now, but not for the purpose of helping dub studios. It's because streamers tend to launch titles globally all at once, and strive to have all the dubs ready at title launch. Whereas in the olden days, you could spread out the dubbing work because regional launches were on different time frames."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"Sounds like they just need to be okay with distributing subtitled versions day-and-date and releasing the dubs later, when they're ready.

Of course, that still poses a challenge for localization and subtitling teams..."
Go! Go! Cory Carson,Film production doesn't work like that and rarely will
Go! Go! Cory Carson,How did you manage to fit that many grammatical into this short of a sentence?
Go! Go! Cory Carson,"It could, but we live under capitalism, where automation is used to help the bottom line of the owners."

Dracula,"""Look at how much smarter I am than these dead Victorian authors."" - Steven Moffat, probably"
Dracula,A lot of these comments sound so much like people trying to sound natural lmao
Dracula,You get it? He sucks blood. But it'll leave you thirsty for more. Lol that's so funny. Thanks lady.
Dracula,"*”Get beat by Count Dracula? You’re smoking crackula
I dunk on your wackula raps like I’m Shaqula”*"
Dracula,I don’t wanna read too much info but..is this released weekly or all episodes at once? I’m currently watching Messiah and that is very interesting so far. If this show is released weekly thatn I can finish up Messiah first.
Dracula,"After the rubbish that was The War of the Worlds I wasn’t holding out much hope but was pleasantly surprised. Good acting, atmospheric and quite gory for a BBC program. Looking forward to the rest of them. 

My only criticism really would be the cockiness of Vanhelsing. I felt the character was a bit over the top."
Dracula,"I loved Sherlock and Moffat’s era of Who but I found this pretty disappointing. The only really engaging characters were Dracula and Sister Agatha which meant that throughout Harker’s narrative you were waiting for the story to flick back to present day.

The first hour really felt like the story was going through some pretty standard plot beats even where it differed from the source material and I had no real sense of why the story was stretched to an hour and a half? 

There were some creepy visuals (Along with some pretty stupid shock value stuff) and clever Moffaty lines. The scene in the courtyard was beautifully tense. But overall I really felt it was style over substance - it just didn’t feel like the kind of creative reinterpretation of the novel Sherlock was."
Dracula,The first half hour was fine. after that it became an outdated mess with overacting.
Dracula,Can’t wait for this to drop on netflix.
Dracula,Lol I thought that was Phil Dunphy from modern family for a sec. would’ve instantly watched
Dracula,This show is fucking amazing.
Dracula,"Yawn, Moffat material tends to start well and end poorly... makes bothering to invest time in his shows unappealing"
Dracula,Lol fake paid reviews are the worst
Dracula,Is this a paid review? The show is absolute shit. The Dracula actor is hilariously bad and looks like an English Seth Macfarlane.
Dracula,"I finished it and thought ""is there ever gonna be a faithful adaptation  and not some 'visionary's' version of it."" Its been adapted so much and none of them have ever come close to generating the character personalities and the embracing the letter / journal theme of the books. :( the female van helsing was a well written character but most of it was trash."
Dracula,Looking forward to checking this out this weekend.
Dracula,I thought it was fucking boring to say the least. What am I missing
Dracula,"I dunno, I was kind of halfway on it. It felt like it couldn't really decide what tone it was going for.

Like, Jonathan Harker is played pretty straight/tragic and mostly time accurate, but then Agatha the nun is very quirky and unconventional and a bit amachronistic and Dracula is practically postmodern and flippant."
Dracula,"the main dude was in the affair and i kept telling the gf that he had something christopher lee ish about him... getting hammer drac vibes from this. i can dig it.

-G."
Dracula,"Not sure what show they watched, I really wanted to like this but it was awful. Cringy, badly paced and totally all over the place. Sort of ... smug? Too.

Ok fine downvotes. I’ll explain why I hated it.

Firstly the accents, not terrible but still, meerkat to cockney was a hell of a journey. 

Secondly the wokeness was so patronising “I’m a strong intelligent woman, your worst nightmare!” Lol, thanks Moffat. And the first five mins asking if Dracula was gay with Harker, so the shippers know what to do, again, cheers. You know they put in gay characters so the people who hate the show get dismissed as homophobic right? Just ghastly queerbaiting. 

The jokes fell flat, the story was badly paced and despite having such a good source material, it was weak. You don’t like any of the characters, and everything was told to you rather than shown.

I thought the sets were good though. Very nice. Some of the horror was fine."
Dracula,"I think the fear factor lessened over the span of the episode. Dracula started sounding too much like Ricky Gervais that he couldn't be that scary anymore, lol. 

Also don't think the dog transformation scene had the effect it was supposed to on me. Any sequence showing someone trying to claw their way out of an animal with the amniotic sac and whatnot *for that long* is just inevitably going to remind me of that one Ace Ventura scene. 

Overall still entertaining though, will tune in for the next two. Good performance from Dolly Wells; don't know if I think the character really fits Van Helsing, but the acting nonetheless was well done. Actress playing Mina is also apparently in His Dark Materials and going to be Galadriel in new LoTR series, so I guess I'll keep watching to get a gauge of her acting as well."
Dracula,Looks very interesting! Steven Moffat is definitely capable of putting out some good stuff!
Dracula,"""I've been dying to meet you."" Dracula says at one point.

The very point I stop watching"
Dracula,"Quite enjoyed it. I hope we see more of Agatha though. She was definitely the highlight of the first episode.

Does anyone know if she practiced her Dutch accent for it? I looked her up and she's from Britain. As a Dutch person myself it was pretty convincingly."
Dracula,Ah I guess the Dracula PR team paid Reddit enough money to plaster *three* posts about this fucking show on the front page.
Dracula,"If it's upvoted here and I just saw another top post that was just their ""genius"" billboard, I'm gonna go ahead and guess this is a similar hype generating media team to The Witcher (which is mediocre to say the least)"
Dracula,This is encouraging. I was giving this a miss after the BBCs last attempt at Dracula was an absolute shit show. I guess I'll check this out after all.
Dracula,I just happened to catch most of this yesterday. Very impressive.
Dracula,It was very Gattis and Moffat and I kept expecting the Dr to show up... But otherwise its well worth watching if for no other reason Agatha the Nun is awesome
Dracula," If your going to have someone from League of Gentleman do 'Dracula', I'd take Shearsmith and Pemberton anyday.

 Will be watching on iPlayer tonight though, hope it's a good time - always up fore more horror."
Dracula,Maybe not the best caption but ok
Dracula,I will for more Agatha. Seeing her proke and prod Vanhelsing was the most fascniating part.
Dracula,[deleted]
Dracula,"Everyone's talking about how poorly it's been adapted. Well to my fresh eyes who haven't seen/read older version of classic Dracula, I enjoyed the first two episodes. Loved the writing and somehow they kept the tension intact. I'm sad that there's going to be only three episodes though"
Dracula,"Since all other subreddits for the BBC/Netflix Dracula show are inactive, I thought I'd make one:

### r/TVDracula"
Dracula,"Watched the first episode last night. 

Without spoiling, I thought one scene toward the end was overly long...to the point of being boring. Other than that I enjoyed it."
Dracula,Wait. Aren't vampires supposed to sparkle and be full of angst?
Dracula,It was good for 5 minutes. The nurse was interesting but then downhill all the way. If you fuck with a classic you’d better do it well or you are cursed.
Dracula,If the show is [as good as their marketing](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/eiyhyr/bbcs_dracula_billboard_is_1000_iq_advertising/) it is worth a look.
Dracula,[deleted]
Dracula,I watched about 10minutes of it and I saw a rip off/ homage of a werewolf in London scene and an eastern European count speaking in a perfect british accent with some rather hammy dialogue.
Dracula,u/kingkyuss
Dracula,This looks awesome!
Dracula,How many episodes will there be?
Dracula,thanks for the heads up. had not heard about this. awesome people are loving it. will definitely check out.
Dracula,Being released on Netflix this Saturday!
Dracula,"Moffat.. Some good work, but also some really bad ones. (Season 3 of Sherlock is really bad.)

So i will give it a try."
Dracula,"Is it on any of the US streaming services? Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon?"
Dracula,oh god no
Dracula,"Its different and that is what I enjoyed. Very light humour, still shockable horror which merges easily and excellent script. Its an adaptation so cannot be argued that it doesn’t follow the actual book and I for one cannot wait for the next episode"
Dracula,"Seeing that it's BBC, I'll wait a week for the whole series to be out"
Dracula,Sounds like a review of my ex.
Dracula,"This show is amazing!!!! .....actually, after watching all 3.....this show sucks! What massive turn, from good to horrible in 2 hours."
Dracula,[deleted]
Dracula,"Claes Bang was great, but Sister Agatha  was my favorit character in first episode

edit:spoiler"
Dracula,"Based only on your headline op , I’m going to skip it, thanks"
Dracula,"No thanks - just more unoriginal, derivative and likely agenda-pushing tosh from Moffat and the crew at the BBC. WHEN did the Guardian start hiring SOCIAL MEDIA-RUINED PEOPLE to write reviews? I'm also long over the whole 'oh look it's horific violence to upbeat music' nonsense that lazy writers fall back on - it's been done to death, just stop it.

\[Edit\] Downvoted, but now that the series has finished and the reviews are coming in, can you really say I was wrong? Thanks BBC for once again proving that cutting the cord and not paying the licence fee is the right thing to do."
Dracula,Giggity
Dracula,"being hyped is a bit silly, but damn i sure am for this series"
Dracula,Maybe this one will be book accurate... Only 2 faithful adaptations and one of those is Coppola which is just eh
Dracula,"I dunno if i liked it. I liked the differences, particularly Van helsing, i thought it was quite good, but one thing that always irked me was the portrayal of Dracula. Way too quippy and modern. Reminded me of Moriarty from the BBC sherlock series."
Dracula,"Huh, it's that good?"
Dracula,No offense but they should've cast a hotter actor.
Dracula,Dracula isn't rated 18 im not interested
Dracula,"> Not sure who to trust lol.

i mean it has some goofy anachronistic dialogue, and some usual shit moffat throws into his shows. its 'entertaining' but easy to see why people wouldnt like it."
Dracula,"This sub tends to gush over every new show, it seems.  If history is any indicator this ""greatest pilot of all time!"" Is probably a solid 7 out of 10."
Dracula,It's Moffat. Easy watching while trying to be clever. Maybe a bit smug. Slightly campy. You'll either love it or hate it
Dracula,I didn't like it to be fair. But I'm also not gonna try and dump all over everyones good time. Some will like it and others wont. Opinions are great things :)
Dracula,"A low IMDb rating indicates garbage. A very high IMDb rating indicates garbage with some toxic fans.

At the moment it is at 7.9 and I think I put it on my list."
Dracula,"As long as its better than the last adaptation (the one starring Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), which I actually liked, but just think it can be done better."
Dracula,[deleted]
Dracula,"My quick read is the extreme gushing is coming from people who are obsessed with Doctor Who, and they tend to be a loyal, vocal and highly passionate bunch. So if that’s a show that’s entirely unappealing to you, I’m guessing the comments on the billboard post are going to be more reflective of your takeaway on Dracula."
Dracula,"Last time I saw a division between Reddit and critics, it was Man of Steel. 

I trusted Reddit. 

I was wrong to do so."
Dracula,News sites comments are cancer encoded. Never bother reading them.
Dracula,"I mean that's the thing. Just like the tone of the show, I was very back and forth. I still don't know whether I thought it was amazing or terrible. I'm not even sure I'll have made up my mind by the end of the second part."
Dracula,Somewhere inbetween. Guardian are a bit irritable and harder to please than here.
Dracula,"Ok, good. I was super confused by the same two threads as well. I'll probably give it a shot now."
Dracula,"I just watched episode 1 and 2, I really like Dracula and horror in general. I found it pretty entertaining, among others there is a witty nun and, well, Dracula, and she tries to figure out the vampire tropes (cross, sun, invitation and so on). The dialogue is a bit cheesy, but you get used to the constant puns of ""drinking blood"" (""Do you like Science, Count Dracula?"" -""Let's say I have a thirst for it."" ba dum tiss). I just fear that it goes into ""Lucifer"" territory soon. I don't really know where they are going with this, it would've been a great 2-part mini-series. But they had my curiosity and now they have my attention for at least 2 more episodes."
Dracula,from past experience whenever a new show is released Reddit becomes hounded by marketing teams aiming to push you to watch the show. so never trust random praises here
Dracula,"Yourself. By looking at the show and what it contains and judging its content based on what you know of it. 

Its worked for me my entire life. There was a point in time where i live when all shows came with a guide and summary of what was in them. 

Now if you care about ""spoilers"" than you can trust nothing. Since you dont want to know about the show and dont want anyone to give anything away you can never know unless you watch it yourself."
Dracula,"the moffat giveth, and the moffat taketh away"
Dracula,Why don’t you trust yourself to watch it and then make your own opinion instead of depending on the opinions of others.
Dracula,"Well, it is surprisingly nice I have to say, though I was expecting some cheese story, so I had my hopes quite low.

The plot was more or less predictable, some minor twists that added little to the overall story though. Let's see how it will continue.

It's not horrible by far and the characters seem more realistic than other shows I have seen recently (considering their reasons on why they do want they want to do), but it is not ground shakingly new or impressive. At least so far. And considering pilots are usually the better past of a show I am sceptical."
Lost Hearts,"Even though it's just for placeholder reasons, I like the music from the games being used. If the series actually happened they should've went with that."
Lost Hearts,It's crazy to see Kingdom Hearts with a coherent plot and dialogue that doesn't sound like alien robots. This thing actually had a ton of potential and charm.
Lost Hearts,"The Traverse Town theme is one of my favourite pieces of score ever.

https://youtu.be/QQ8y81D_IGY"
Lost Hearts,"It sucks that they stopped making it, they still very much could."
Lost Hearts,[deleted]
Lost Hearts,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
Lost Hearts,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
Lost Hearts,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
Lost Hearts,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
Lost Hearts,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
Lost Hearts,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
Lost Hearts,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
Lost Hearts,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
Lost Hearts,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
Lost Hearts,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
Lost Hearts,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
Lost Hearts,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
Lost Hearts,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
Lost Hearts,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
Lost Hearts,🙂💕
Lost Hearts,It’s great but it’s depressing.
Lost Hearts,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
Lost Hearts,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
Lost Hearts,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
Lost Hearts,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
Lost Hearts,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
Lost Hearts,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
Lost Hearts,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
Lost Hearts,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
Lost Hearts,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
Lost Hearts,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
Lost Hearts,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
Lost Hearts,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
Lost Hearts,"Keep in mind that space colonies in the future will be on Mars and the like, so you’d be exploring barren planets.  I think The Expanse paints a much more realistic view of future space travel."
Lost Hearts,"I feel sad watching it as well, but mostly because the writing is kinda bad.."
Lost Hearts,"I guess I am resigned to this. Contrary to what we see in sci-fi, our current propulsion technology is just nowhere near where it needs to be to make manned voyages to neighboring planets—let alone stars!—feasible. I do hope I at least live to see humanity take their first steps on Mars. That is doable, but we'll need a massive technological breakthrough to make visiting even our closest neighboring star Alpha Centauri feasible. "
Lost Hearts,That makes me sad every day. My dream job was always to be a science officer on a starship. I would prefer the enterprise D.
Lost Hearts,"Born too late to explore the World.

Born too early to explore the Stars.

Born right on time to have a President who banged Porn Stars and wants a Space Army and hate every minute of it."
Lost Hearts,I don't know it's still possible I guess. Regardless you are gonna see the birth of AI so that's pretty cool. 
Lost Hearts,"If you look the time we do live in it's amazing.  I was a kid in the late 70's and 80's and have got to see technology grow at an unprecedented rate.  I mean, I am broadcasting a message right now that people all over the world can see and respond to.  I have a computer in my pocket with access to virtually any information I can imagine, I can make video calls to people anywhere in the world essentially for free.  I can talk to a computer that controls the lights, temperature and locks in my home.  Cars are driving themselves.

I live in a sci-fi world my 14 year old self could barely dream about.  If the next 40 years is anything like the last I can't imagine today what my kids will be looking at.

Yeah, we aren't colonizing planets, but unfortunately that may never be in the cards.  Space is just so damn big, and physics may just not allow for it.  It's a real possibility that there may be something that we just haven't figured out which makes it possible or even trivial, but it's also possible that in a universe this large we're just confined to our own little tiny sphere of influence. 

We live in an amazing time today.  Enjoy that rather than wishing you had what may never be.

[And, while I do like Lost In Space, the science in the show is pretty bad.  As others have mentioned the expanse is probably a lot better, and even that has been super dumbed down for TV.  It should take a lot longer to get anywhere, and the books do a good job working with it!]
"
Lost Hearts,Born just in time to browse dank memes. 
Lost Hearts,"I was watching Enterprise and Captain Archer gave a speech about how he lives in a time when humans are 'priveleged' to know the answer to the question: ""are we alone?"". Made me a little sad too."
Lost Hearts,You can pull a Cameron and sink yourself into the Marianas Trench.
Lost Hearts," I've struggled with this myself but no matter what age you are born in there will always be people that will envy the future. 

On the bright side our earth is healthy enough to sustain us for the time being so we should enjoy the time we have here. Being cramped on a space station or ship for months on end can strain even the toughest minds. I'm sure there will be people in these space colonies that wish they could be born in our time and live on Earth. "
Lost Hearts,I'm sad about that pretty much every day of my life. 
Lost Hearts,Of course you can be an explorer on Earth right now. There's plenty left to find and log.
Lost Hearts,But in real life faster than light travel may never happen and humans might never colonize other planets. 
Lost Hearts,just go meditate friend and you can explore as far you need to
Lost Hearts,"It often seems like you can't be an explorer on earth, that everything has already been experienced and every story has been heard. I believe this is false. There are unexplored cities within cities, a small ethnic population, or a sub-culture, or an event which only has meaning for a small group of people in your hometown. My experience has been that if you avail yourself to these places and you ask questions and listen and make friends in these groups an entire section of the world opens to you, like discovering a previously dark section of a map in a video game. Exploring is less about physical geography and more about insatiable curiosity. Why is that one thing there? Where did this come from? What language is that?

I have spent the better part of the last ten years traveling around the world and I am constantly astounded by how little I know and understand of the entirety of the globe. All of the continents in the world have been mapped, yes, but the world is always changing like sand dunes in the desert. 

That being said, it is unfortunate that space exploration isn't quite there yet, but I think the world is more than enough for the moment. This thing is big."
Lost Hearts,There's lots of exploration to do in the deep blue
Lost Hearts,"I wanted to go to space once.....but then I saw alien, event horizon and played dead space"
Lost Hearts,[deleted]
Lost Hearts,I'll be sadder when they attempt and fail to reboot Land of the Giants.
Lost Hearts,Could be worse........you could be the humans who colonize LV426
Lost Hearts,"A properly sized Lightsail craft can be to the outer planets in 3 months.

Also Musk said his BFR can be used for journeys aside from Mars.

We can do the solar system just need a hundred years or so."
Lost Hearts,"LIS makes me sad because the actors who play Will and Dr. Smith are garbage....and...well...I can probably put up with Will, because he's like 10....but Parker Posey is garbage."
Lost Hearts,"You're looking at this all wrong - the unexplored areas of our globe are just underwater, and require a lot of the same questions regarding pressure gradients and structural stability to be answered that space travel does. Chuck Yeager wasn't an astronaut, but every astronaut is a technological descendant of his achievements - similarly, those able to conquer the deep seas will be the forefathers of the next generation of space travel in some way. 

Secondarily, I just saw an amazing film called *Into The Okavango*, and [this trailer](https://vimeo.com/124421450) for it does a good job of showing that, while we may not have absolutely blank spots to be filled in on our maps any longer, we do have plenty of ways to experience true wilderness that few of us take advantage of.

Another example of an area (on land) to still be explored is Mosquitia in Central America - it's featured heavily in the book *Lost City of the Monkey God*, which is about an entire ancient city that had gone undiscovered until very recently. The terrain and environment are so tough that they kept people out until technology has allowed us to go there with a small degree of safety and comfort - but what is exploration short of walking the edge of that boundary between possible and not possible?

Anyway, I hear what you're saying about being caught between times, but if you look closely at what opportunities exist right now, rather than focusing on those you miss by being too soon or too late, then you'll find what you're looking for."
Lost Hearts,"You sound butthurt, the butthurt closet is down the hall.

The notion that man will colonize other planets is a pipe dream, smoke and mirrors.  Most all of the explorers past and present were nothing more than greedy evil tyrants looking for a payday.

"
Lost Hearts,I mean you weren't born in the wrong age people actually do that but let's be honest you don't believe that do you?
Lost Hearts,[deleted]
Lost Hearts,Lost in Space hurts my heart because of how bad of a show it is. It has so many great parts and it could do so many great things but it isn't. 
Lost Hearts,"Speaking of the Expanse, should I push through the first few episodes? I watched the first one, and after it was over I wasn't sure what I watched."
Lost Hearts,"I just wished it showed Mars. Like I still have no idea if Mars is terraformed to have breathable air or if  its a closed system. Sure there may have been some mentions of it, but I didn't catch it. Maybe with an increases budget this show would show Mars?"
Lost Hearts,You think so? I really like it 
Lost Hearts,"Star Trek definitely made me feel this way too, but I think the family dynamics make this feel more real to me which is why it hit a little harder. "
Lost Hearts,"For sure! No telling how much will change in the next 60 years, especially seeing how far we have come in such a short amount of time."
Lost Hearts,"Very true, definitely count my blessings. I just feel like being a part of something so huge and so new would be incredible."
Lost Hearts,"Also, if you have an explorer's soul, while humans may have set foot somewhere before, there are still a great many places on Earth that was new to you and still relatively unspoiled by civilization. And a great many career options that will take you to them (although, be warned they many may not pay especially well, as they're charity or NGO or environmental or scientific research-type work). "
Lost Hearts,Just trying to start conversation bro 
Lost Hearts,That is such an interesting read! We definitely appear to be self destructing currently.
Lost Hearts,Things get explained more as the show goes on.  All in all it’s a fantastic show.
Lost Hearts,The Expanse has a story and world it has to build for its viewers in the opening episodes.  Some people recommend that it takes off and gets good halfway through season 1.  I didn't mind the buildup and I really like the story.  
Lost Hearts,Try reading the wiki page for each episode after you finish one. I find it helps me get a handle on what's going on with some shows.
Lost Hearts,It's a slow burn show for sure. The first few episodes are world-building. Then the intensity ramps up. 
Lost Hearts,I think the answer for basically any show is yes. Almost every show requires a few episodes (3-4) before you can accurately decided whether or not it's worth your time. 
Lost Hearts,"The whole first season is the ""set up"".  Now we can begin the real show..  But it's already become a bit mundane so we'll see.."
Lost Hearts,"Loved the first season, then episode one of season two started with some female marine who was all attitude, showed no respect for her superiors and had a big mouth. Done and dusted. Why can't they show women as normal people rather than as characters you'd want to throw your drink over?"
Lost Hearts,The expanse is the best sci-fi show out there.
Lost Hearts,We do see Mars in the show (it's not terraformed). Have you met Bobby Draper yet? 
Lost Hearts,"I liked it but thought some of the writing was bad. Specifically how Dr Smith would wake up minutes after being sedated, or how she knew where to put the him so only one colonist would find it as go shooting etc

Great actor though."

Lost Hearts,"I agree that asteroid mining is the more likely space travel we'll see until there's some breakthrough and warp speed/hyperspace is discovered. We're just going to spend a lot of time traveling between Earth, Mars, and the Asteroid Belt, with maybe some trips/colonies on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

I'll give it another shot."
Lost Hearts,Oh wait... The episode where these guys were stealing water or something and the Punisher like arrested the guy..was that on Mars?
Lost Hearts,Yeah I am caught up. Maybe I saw Mars? Was it the fight simulation or patrol they had? I didn't associate a specific land mass for that.
Lost Hearts,Can the Robinsons survive on this planet without Oreos?
Lost Hearts,"> So why even bother making it seem, in every episode, like one or more are going to die?

In only like two of the seven episodes I've seen so far has there been any real threat of some of them dying."
Lost Hearts,"With the exception of Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, what shows kill off major characters every episode?  Lost in Space killed off 1 major role in the first season and a great many others died as well.  I can't stand this argument about the show.  People need to apply this same logic to all the other great sci fi shows out there.  I don't recall deaths every episode of Star Trek, BSG, or Stargate.  Plus its a children oriented show.  "
Lost Hearts,"I get what you're saying, but the characters don't know that. And those situations they're in impact their behavior and attitude moving forward. It might not be the most suspenseful, but it still has character drama in a unique setting. "
Lost Hearts,Just trying to spark conversation thanks though
Lost Hearts,"If The Expanse comes across as too dark, then the animation Planetes also has a realistic interpretation of future space travel, and is an all around fantastic show."
Lost Hearts,"No, that's on Ceres, when Joseph Miller busts the kid who turns OPA. But when Bobby & her unit have a training drill and then Bobby looks at some habitat domes and then projects them into the future, all of that is on Mars. I think there are a few other shots of the domes at different points too. "
Lost Hearts,Could anyone?
Lost Hearts,[deleted]
Lost Hearts,so not Earth. Which makes it unique. 
Lost Hearts,Decreasing ratings and increasing costs I'd imagine
Lost Hearts,We loved the show for the first couple of seasons - and then dropped off as it increasingly talked politics.
Lost Hearts,It lost it's heart.
Lost Hearts,"~~Im only two episodes into this~~ I've watched the series and I must say that they DO NOT disappoint.  It's just as dark and twisted as the original YouTube series, but with  23 minute episodes.

Edit: We all have a worm in our brain!"
A Love to Last,"To anyone who hasn’t played TLoU2, just leave any TLoU thread. Too many people hint at stuff that’ll happen in the future in these threads."
A Love to Last,"So in the game I totally understood Joel’s POV. 

I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Not the killing part but the moral quandary was not one for me.

The lying though was a mistake.

In the show it was more disturbing because they really portrayed him as a mass shooter."
A Love to Last,"I like this statement:

>Good stories are not built on themes like “brotherhood” or “anger”; those are just words. Good stories are built on arguments: It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that."
A Love to Last,Well Neil Druckmann did first when he wrote the game. Craig is just echoing that here.
A Love to Last,This guy was such a moron in the after the episode specials. Can’t listen to him at all.
A Love to Last,These guys think they are way smarter than they are.
A Love to Last,[removed]
A Love to Last,This is why I love the characters so much...they are layered. No one is the good guy or bad guy; everyone has reasons for doing what they're doing. Nuance makes for a great show!
A Love to Last,Omg it’s a tv show not a moral compass. My god can we not have anything?!
A Love to Last,Gonna be so thankful i got a teenage girl brain slurry vaccine when cannibal rapists chop off my legs or a bloater rips out my spine
A Love to Last,"Empathy is a double edged sword too. 

You can just as much empathize with a hobo as you can with a Nazi. 

We need to understand we are not infallible.  That our emotions are not truths. That our instincts are tools, not laws. That dogs trusting these same feelings can see children as threats and attack them. We are no different. 

But what we do after acknowledging...how we ACT on these principles is something neither Neil nor Mazen has yet to interrogate 

I'd like to see less critique and more attempts at solutions that promote dialogue."
A Love to Last,"That's a cool concept and all, but I'm not sure this is the right scenario to explore it because I don't think it feels nearly as grey as that would require. Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here, or consider them ""negative"" expressions of love in any meaningful way."
A Love to Last,Joel entering the Avatar State to save Ellie.
A Love to Last,Thanks for the heads up
A Love to Last,"As someone who hasn't played the game, all of these discussion threads are so frustrating. Everyone constantly talking about what happened in the game. I don't care about the game, I'm just trying to enjoy the TV show."
A Love to Last,"I have played neither game and am watching this series and loving it so far. Thank you for the heads up, even though so much time has passed. Appreciate it"
A Love to Last,Bless you
A Love to Last,I basically told all of my family and friends to *not* read any article or community regarding it because people are so toxic about it in general if they wanted to keep fresh eyes and not be spoilt.
A Love to Last,"Or you know, don’t frequent threads that might spoil things for you in the first place?

The games vs the show have very different fan bases. The show moves faster than the game. You don’t want spoilers?

Don’t watch the show until you’ve played the game. It’s that simple. 

Spoiler avoidance from game to show? Two completely different ball games. Do not make demands that can not be met."
A Love to Last,"The HBO specific sub really needs to enforce a ""No Game Talk"" rule or have ""Show Only"" threads"
A Love to Last,It wouldn't be a problem if they'd fucking release it for PC
A Love to Last,"I still understand his PoV. They were going to kill his daughter again. I also understand that it's not the morally ""right"" thing to do, and it's also very selfish. But a lot of parents would go for the selfish option without even thinking of the impact it'd leave on their child.

Ellie now has the corpses of the potential saviors of humanity on her name. All while believing her immunity can't be for nothing. That's rough."
A Love to Last,"Ironic given that you kill A LOT more people in the game (because it's a fame, I understand thebseparation of media, just funny that it felt that way)"
A Love to Last,"> So I’m the game I totally understood Joel’s POV.
> 
> I was immediately onboard with the decision lol.

Yeah, first time I played the game... there wasn't a thought of sneak through the hospital. Like Joel, I killed everyone that was in the way."
A Love to Last,"You don't feel that way in the game because you've been mowing enemies for the past 16 hours of playtime by then. You're desensitized to the violence by that point. 

Joel has less action in the show, which makes the last scene more impactful. That's great writing to be honest."
A Love to Last,"He definitely was a mass shooter in the game, but when you’re controlling him you empathize. When he’s autonomous and you have to sit and watch him do it, you see it more objectively. It was fascinating for me how differently I felt about events as a player and a viewer."
A Love to Last,My friend said that it gave off school shooter vibes
A Love to Last,"I mean, I don't know – I'm not sure Tolkien would agree.

Heck, larger themes like ""loyalty"" and ""brotherhood"", etc. were a huge part of the driving forces in LoTR."
A Love to Last,"> It’s worth killing everyone to save the person you love. We can debate that.

I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad"""
A Love to Last,"This is what bothers me about tlou2 talk. It's fucking shallow as shit. People talk about it like it's exploring some deep theme. It's not. It's the basic premise of anylove story really. What would you do for love? What's interesting is not that ""from a different perspective, things are different!"" That's fucking basic. What makes love stories interesting is the individuals involved and their growth within the story. 

Murder is bad? Yes. This is a shit story. Violence begets violence? Yes, this is a base level concept that many stories use but builder deeper themes and characters on top to become great. TLOU2 is basic shit."
A Love to Last,I think this is just putting to bed the cope a lot of fans are feeling over certain scenes potentially being changed.
A Love to Last,Co-wrote*
A Love to Last,"The podcast is genuinely unbearable, he sounds incredibly pretentious."
A Love to Last,[removed]
A Love to Last,Joel is absolutely the bad guy in this situation. We understand and feel for him cause we are watching his perspective but if we watched an entirely different character up until they are brutally murdered by this stranger Joel at the hospital we’d absolutely look at him as the villain. He made a selfish (understandably) choice.
A Love to Last,"I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I'd say The Last of Us 1&2 absolutely acknowledge and question the impact of how someone responds to their emotions/instincts, and the alternatives to acting off instinct or emotion. The games (and this first season of the show) are constantly questioning the morality of characters actions, especially when their reasons for acting may be sympathetic or instinctive.

What exactly is it you think this IP has critiqued that even has a solution? What has it not encouraged a dialogue for?"
A Love to Last,"I was taught this quite effectively in GCSE English in the 90s. We read a piece of prose about a military officer getting chocolate for his daughter on his way home from work during a terrible war in winter.

It was a wholesome, but boring, story.

After we'd finished reading it the teacher asked us what the ""snow"" could be. It was worded in such a way it wasn't obvious. Then they explained - he's on his way home from the Concentration Camps. The ""snow"" was the ash of corpses he'd ordered be burnt.

The story and it's allusions suddenly made MUCH more sense. It was a 'wholesome' story but with one hell of a fucking kick.

We were all stunned. This guy who we'd all decided was a wholesome dad going about his day and getting his sweet daugther a chocolate bar during this terrible war. Turned out to be a fucking Nazi Deathcamp leader.

It was a real eye opener and has stayed with me for 25 years."
A Love to Last,[Big ol' spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-nQUiD6_g&t=333s&ab_channel=Wisecrack)
A Love to Last,The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.  Is there a particular reason you think the show will be any different?
A Love to Last,"I thought Joel was straight-up evil in the finale, but you don’t think his actions were “negative?!”"
A Love to Last,">Nobody watching is going to be unsympathetic to the calls made by the characters here

Yes, that's called protagonist bias and some of the most interesting media being made lately is about confronting that and recognizing that other perspectives outside the one presented to you as the most sympathetic are just as valid. 

It's always interesting to me how many struggle with that while being simultaneously angry that the media confronting that... is about that. ""Why are they trying to tell me violence and revenge are bad?"" They shout as they miss the point entirely and defend Joel as if those he's murdered don't have equally valid lives and families.

That's not to say that those who want a shallow reading or story of good guys v. bad guys are wrong for wanting that but it does feel weird to be angry at the story for digging deeper.

EDIT: You deleted your reply so I'll leave my response here: 

>to possibly save a bunch of people who are essentially abstract concepts

But this again misses the point of protagonist bias.

You are asking the narrative to spoonfeed why someone should care about faceless people when the point is that you should care regardless.

The value of the cure is in its possibility, not its certainty. Life doesn't have value because you are told how and why those lives are sympathetic."
A Love to Last,"Highly disagree, >!there was an actual plan for the cure this time!< so fuck him and what he did"
A Love to Last,I’m sorry I don’t understand what you’re saying. Can you explain this to me again while not sounding like a psychopath?
A Love to Last,"It’s honestly so similar that it’s hard not to. 

Same thing happens with book adaptions except most people on reddit play games more than they read books. 

The last of us hbo subreddit has a show or game spoilers thread though if you want to be able to discuss in peace.

/r/thelastofusHBOseries"
A Love to Last,"For those who have played the second game, it’s next to impossible to even discuss the finale and what might be next with those who don’t know the story.

Given their context and details, the spoilers are nearly unavoidable. Easier to simply say nothing than even try to be vague or play dumb—which is it’s own kind of frustrating for fans wanting to talk about it.

Not sure how people will go in Season 2 without knowing some of the bigger plot points.

Though, if you do, props to you. It will be quite the feat."
A Love to Last,"They follow the game story dot for dot when making this story which isv extremely rare. It means you can actually join in the conversation with the players too. After all, the show is made for people who didn't play the game and that's pretty neat because now we're both enjoying the content. That being said .. I love 2 way more than 1 so buckle up!"
A Love to Last,"You know, having ADHD isn’t always great, but I forget things so easily I basically can’t be spoiled. 

That being said, so far as I’m aware, studies have shown spoilers don’t diminish the enjoyment of a piece of media."
A Love to Last,What?
A Love to Last,They do though? There’s not many show only threads but they are there.
A Love to Last,...they do have show only threads
A Love to Last,Rekt
A Love to Last,"I think it can easily be the morally right thing to do.

Murdering people who are already incapacitated is not morally right to me. killing the doctor is not a morally right thing either.

But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I would allow her to sacrifice herself though. That’s the other thing Joel is guilty of, but so are the fireflies."
A Love to Last,There are plenty of ethical arguments that what the Fireflies tried to do is horrible. Not saying its some settled debate but wouldn’t be surprised if other people with medical training wouldn’t be appalled by the operation itself and the way it was handled.
A Love to Last,"It's the cost of love. As a parent, I would do **anything** to protect my children. The love a parent has for their kids is so primal. I didn't understand until my first child was born. Something just switches in people."
A Love to Last,"No, what’s selfish is asking someone to sacrifice their “family” member just so your bloodline can continue"
A Love to Last,The game made it more of a “it’s you or me” situation. The show presented it as him mowing down crowd’s without resistance.
A Love to Last,"Right but you are killing them in your mindset and my mindset was completing the game. As you said, a function of the game is plowing down henchmen albeit with limited resources.

In the show, we get a stronger notion of how unhinged/determined Joel is when it comes to protecting Ellie. We also get a distinction on who it is he’s killing.

I don’t recall a point in the game where someone is sincerely begging for mercy and incapacitated. When they begged then it was either a cutscene or a ruse iirc. 

The weight of it just feels heavier watching it for me."
A Love to Last,"I would say, to amend Mazin’s statement, good stories are built around tension, and that can come in the form of inter-character tension, like tlou, or intra-character tension, like lotr."
A Love to Last,"Well, there was also the “destroy evil on middle-earth” part too haha but yes I agree."
A Love to Last,"Yea that seems like a nothing statement to me. It basically amounts to ""can you turn the themes of your stories and internal struggles of your characters into marketable taglines catered to people who engage with media on a surface level"".

Cause ""It's worth killing everyone to save the person you love"" is the absolute shallow end. It's what conservative preppers dream about when they buy guns."
A Love to Last,">I wish more people actually debated this right here instead of all the excuses about how what Joel did ""isn't actually that bad""

Lol, that is the debate. You feel differently than those people. You sound like you're just wishing everyone agrees with you tbh

This type of story is going to fracture opinions and split ideals. Some people will justify each action Joel made, not realizing it, seeing the lines he is crossing. Others will be horrified and want him to stop. Some will be cheering him on like he is dad of the year, and others will never look at him the same way.

It's a complicated story that has a ton of varied responses from viewers. That's it's strength imo"
A Love to Last,Isn't Druckmann listed as the only writer for the first game?
A Love to Last,neil is the sole credited writer for the first game
A Love to Last,"I loved it. It's refreshing to see the thought process of the creators. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess, but I don't see how he's more pretentious than anyone else deeply connected to a story would be."
A Love to Last,"Everyone in that hospital was actively conspiring to murder Ellie.  They weren't exactly innocent themselves.

Joel wasn't necessarily ""right"" but it's meant to be ambiguous and I do not understand why people act like it's black and white."
A Love to Last,">The game's fanbase has been arguing about it for 10 years now.

Eh. Ish. Like, people talk about it being morally complicated, but... it's not, really, it's more a bit of spice in the characters. Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently? People see it as something that humanises him far, far more likely than they see him as a monster for it. Would people have actually preferred he let shit play out otherwise? I doubt it.

And even if we go with the now clearer idea the cure would work, for example, how much of a difference that would make to this world isn't exactly clear cut. In making such a big deal of the human factional conflict and inevitable grimdarkness of everything in this world, and minimising the gameplay sections (ie the bits where we actually see how dangerous the infected are), the show has made the fungus a secondary problem, so the supposed stakes don't quite stand up. If everybody got immunised tomorrow, it would change very little for a long time."
A Love to Last,"I mean idk.. taking so many lives like he did definitely is bad but am I crazy for feeling like he was justified in doing so? I'm not saying it was right what he did or moral but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it was pure evil. They attack him and Ellie(loves her like a daughter) with stun grenades, knock him out with a rifle, say they are killing his daughter without her consent for a chance at a cure that might not even work and if he tries to go to her they will kill him. Everyone he kills minus the 1 doctor has ARs and are actively trying to kill him to stop him from getting to Ellie. Killing the lead surgeon who was defenseless was the only real issue I had with what he did. That and obviously lying about what happened to Ellie. Marlene would have eventually come after Ellie and was pointing a gun at Joel threatening his life.

If he had left and nothing positive came out of Ellie's murder(yes that's what it would have been) it would have haunted him to his deathbed and completely destroyed him that he didn't save her when he could have just like he didn't save his own daughter. I really believe the situation would have gone completely differently had the doctors given Ellie the choice and let her help Joel understand that this is what she wanted. He would have had closure and Ellie would have had agency over her decision. That and trying other alternatives before moving to something so drastic"
A Love to Last,There’s nothing evil about saving a little girl from being murdered. Joel did nothing wrong.
A Love to Last,"TIL defending your children is considered evil.

There’s a saying that eludes me right now, but it’s something like any parent would rather let the world burn than lose their child."
A Love to Last,"While I don’t think killing people is a thing I could do, I would never allow the use of a kid in the way they did either.

In the game the killing is far easier then actually seeing it in the drama though. 

Still there is no question in my mind that fireflies were wrong unless they specifically asked Ellie which they did not."
A Love to Last,Need a cure for the 2 groups of infected he ran into throughout a cross country expedition?
A Love to Last,It's more that people just outright post spoilers
A Love to Last,Are you sure it followed the game dot for dot??
A Love to Last,I hate spoilers. It takes the excitement and surprise out of watching a show.
A Love to Last,Then why is everyone bitching about spoilers?
A Love to Last,"I think it's fascinating because Ellie makes it pretty abundantly clear that given the choice, she would absolutely sacrifice herself and Joel knew that. To me, it's even doubly selfish that he *knows* what path she would choose and he took that choice away from her. And he *knows* what he did was wrong, otherwise he wouldnt have lied to her. Joel is a broken selfish man and it's engaging as fuck."
A Love to Last,"I feel like they knew they were going about this the wrong way too. By sedating her and immediately going for the surgery, they purposely robbed her of the choice so she couldn't say no, so they wouldn't have to put down a screaming child. That's absolutely monstrous, even if the outcome was a positive for humanity."
A Love to Last,"> But I wouldn’t sacrifice a child to save humanity who has adapted to the new world order.

I think that's an incredibly naive thing to say since you haven't lived through an apocalypse. Would people who think it's normal to see their loved ones killed by infected feel the same way as people who post on reddit from the safety of their own homes?"
A Love to Last,It's one thing if they were 100% sure they could make a cure out of killing her. But they seemed more desperate and clinging to the last illusion of hope they have. There is also the fact that the fireflies won't give the cure for free and will use it to gain power and replace the government.
A Love to Last,It’s more than just the bloodline of the ff it’s all bloodlines potentially
A Love to Last,You mean like mankind has been doing for millions of years with war? Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are offering their children up right now to try and preserve the tribe.
A Love to Last,"Most of the people he killed had assault rifles and were actively trying to kill him.  The only really ""unjustifable"" kill, at least onscreen, was the guy who tried to put down his gun."
A Love to Last,Retcon
A Love to Last,100% agree. They did great with that. Humanizing the enemy. It was impactful with the kid that Ellie paralyzed and Joel killed. Having him beg for his life and call out for his mom was brutal.
A Love to Last,"Yeah, and I don't mean to be overly-critical. I'm not a writer and I didn't study it, and sometimes these quotes are taken out of context."
A Love to Last,"> Lol, that is the debate.

No, it's a different debate. Instead of asking if it's morally right for Joel to doom the world to protect his family, instead the debate is switched to ""Joel was actually saving the world"" or ""Joel knew the cure wouldn't work!""

Stuff like ""the Fireflies mishandled the whole situation"" falls under the original debate. Things like ""Well the cure wasn't likely anyway"" is moving away from the original debate to just flat out saying murder is okay because the cure would fail"
A Love to Last,"Yes.

Game Director: Bruce Straley

Creative Director: Neil Druckmann

Written By: Neil Druckmann

https://www.mobygames.com/game/60922/the-last-of-us/credits/ps3/"
A Love to Last,"If you go by the game credits, Neil was in charge of the story and is credited as creative director and Written By, and Bruce Straley handled the gameplay side. If you go by what people online say, Bruce reigned in some of Neil's narrative choices to improve it to the story we wound up with in the final product. 

Where the truth lays? I don't know. But yes, Neil is credited as the sole creative contributor.

Edit - Not sure what I said to upset people; the credits are what they are."
A Love to Last,Glad you enjoyed it. Guess I just have a different perspective working in the film industry with these types. Wish we had heard more from the other co-creator who actually made the game.
A Love to Last,"No one’s acting like it’s black and white and being a bad or good guy is completely subjective. In the story that’s being told here Joel essentially took away the chance to have “literally” saved humanity because he couldn’t handle losing Ellie. His actions are absolutely understandable but he still fucked over others to have his way. The hospital/fireflies weren’t conspiring to murder Ellie, what a dumb and absolutely ridiculous way to phrase them trying to make a cure that could save mankind. Putting aside whether it would work or the logistics of it the point is they had noble means and Joel is the opposite. His actions were selfish and could have ultimately doomed the world. It’s not black and white but he’s absolutely “narrative term here” the bad guy in this situation and even by saying that I understand his motivations and actions. You can still root for and respect the bad guys actions. It’s not at all ambiguous, it’s a moral debate. I don’t think you understand the term ambiguous."
A Love to Last,Why the downvotes?
A Love to Last,"> Would anyone ever believe Joel might choose differently?  

That's not the question posed, it's whether Joel was justified in his actions or was he completely and unwaveringly selfish or even both. You're not supposed to question whether he should've made a different decision (I don't think he ever would and that's why in the game you aren't given the choice) but question whether he is justified in his actions (which I do not)."
A Love to Last,"I don't have much sympathy for the Fireflies at all for the reasons you give, but also because I have zero confidence in them to actual accomplish anything. They are NOT a competent resistance group, the Fireflies and I have no faith in their ability to generate a cure. Even if they managed to, how would they distribute it?

Killing the surgeon was easily the most questionable thing Joel did (and certainly will come back to haunt him depending how close they follow the second game in the future), but frankly, the surgeon was something of a dumbass. I was laughing at the guy when he was put down.

""How did you get in here?""

He just did a John Wick and slaughtered all your mooks. Did you not hear the gunfire?

""I won't let you take her!""

Again, he just took down a dozen guys and is here with a gun. You're giving his daughter to him or...oh, never mind, he just shot you."
A Love to Last,"I gotta agree, have you ever seen anything about a game called Lisa: The Painful? Similar premise, but I feel it does a better job with the toxic love question. While also giving the daughter character agency to maker her own choices"
A Love to Last,"he only slaughtered countless men, including several that were trying to surrender and pleading for their live. He shot the doctor in the head without flinching, when he didnt have to. He shot and killed Marlene, who was also actively trying to reason with him. 

""nothing wrong"" lol"
A Love to Last,"You're insane if you really think that 

Like I get rationalizing Joel's act because you love Joel but saying he did NOTHING wrong at all is just outright evil shit."
A Love to Last,And he robbed countless of lives from being saved and cured with a vaccine.
A Love to Last,"Evil is a strong word, but everyone is the hero of their own story and the villain in someone else's. Loads of people aren't going to give a shit how much Joel loves Ellie (who they would happily point out is not actually 'his'), while their own children and millions of others are dying. To them he is the bad guy. Maybe even evil."
A Love to Last,"People think crossing an arbitrary border to save your child's life is evil, why the surprise here?"
A Love to Last,That's not his child!

"Sex, Explained","Having just watched episode 5, in the words of that elf dude, SHE WAS MAGNIFICENT!"
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",Sounds like she didn't do the first sex scene because it wasn't with Henry.  She did the rest of the sex scenes because it's with Henry.  I don't blame her.
"Sex, Explained","I was extremely disappointed that for all the nudity she did, Henry didn't even give us a glimpse of his ass"
"Sex, Explained","This actress has incredible tits. I'm curious, do casting directors make actors strip to see the goods? I mean if the parts they're auditioning for have nude scenes then surely it's pertinent to see the body first? Is that something that is done?"
"Sex, Explained","All of Anya’s nude scenes were very tastefully done, in fact most the nude scenes aren’t even sexual in nature. I think she did a fabulous job as Yen."
"Sex, Explained",Who wrote this? The grammar gave my headache
"Sex, Explained",Because she has an incredible body and nice nipples?
"Sex, Explained",More nude Geralt please
"Sex, Explained","So this headline is of course misleading. She was required to be nude and such most of the time (this is normal, when an actors takes a part like this they understand it includes nudity), she was offered a double only during wide shot sex scenes where you can't tell its her, which is common, even in non-sex scenes to have stand ins."
"Sex, Explained",[removed]
"Sex, Explained",I will now watch The Witcher.
"Sex, Explained",She really doesn’t need a body double.
"Sex, Explained",Money. It was because of the money
"Sex, Explained","Shamefully terrible piece, crawling with errors."
"Sex, Explained",Do we need an explanation because someone is comfortable with their body?
"Sex, Explained",Ok but when are we gonna see Cavills dingaling then???
"Sex, Explained",Because she has cracking tits
"Sex, Explained","*""looool because she's hot?""*

Being completely nude isn't easy no matter how you look."
"Sex, Explained",I think as many here on reddit i saw quite ALOT pictures or movies of tits and her‘s are some of the very best i ever saw.
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",Because she doesn't have enough clout as an actress to get away with it yet and if she hadn't been willing they'd have cast someone else?
"Sex, Explained",Maybe the witcher might be worth watching.
"Sex, Explained",Now let's see an explanation for why they used some random actress instead of one that fits the description of Triss.
"Sex, Explained",Because she's an adult and can separate work from actual sexual intimacy.
"Sex, Explained",To make Reddit’s dicks hard
"Sex, Explained",I fully support this.
"Sex, Explained",Sexualization is a lie
"Sex, Explained","I’ll say this, I knew she was hot even when they tried to make her ugly with the humped back and mouth piece. Her body is superb and I only wish we could catch a glimpse of her backside as well. Hell, I would simply love to see all of her she is gorgeous!!!"
"Sex, Explained",Just skipped most of those scenes.  They can be done better without the shock grab of unnecessary nudity
"Sex, Explained","This sub is gonna be lousy with Witcher posts for a while, huh?

EDIT: Jeez, ask a simple question and get downvoted into oblivion. Witcher fans are sensitive."
"Sex, Explained",Weird cavill didn't show anything
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",Everybody seem to be a expert
"Sex, Explained",Not as hot as yennefer in game
"Sex, Explained",Cuz. She’s. Hit. As. Fuck.
"Sex, Explained",downvote this but Yennefer was supposed to a hot witch. Anya isn't....
"Sex, Explained","She is bae, love her so much."
"Sex, Explained",Good on her. Makes it more believable
"Sex, Explained",because she has a beautiful body and she absolutely should show it off!
"Sex, Explained",Bless her heart
"Sex, Explained","Because its super weird for somebody else to play the most personal scenes for your character?

Why would anyone even ask such an obvious question?"
"Sex, Explained",Mamma!
"Sex, Explained",its the indian half of her
"Sex, Explained",Cavill has body image issues. That s why he pushes himself so hard in the gym. He used to be mocked for his weight.
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained","I thought it was a bit odd that whenever Geralt and Yen had sex, his pants would be on."
"Sex, Explained",Animal kingdom is tailored towards women so of course it would
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",Especially since he got it out in Tudors.. 👍
"Sex, Explained",Cant start a witcher game with out a good shit of geralts bare ass.
"Sex, Explained",Probably cause that butt is fake :P

"Sex, Explained",Anybody notice her body looked basically flawless during the sex scene when she was supposed to have been grossly deformed and have a fucked up spine? Then when she's back to walking around all of a sudden she is hunched over again. Didn't make any sense at all.
"Sex, Explained",Even my gf said that!
"Sex, Explained",Bobby b? That u?
"Sex, Explained",They were super perfect.  Have breast implants gotten really good or did they just do great boob casting in this show?
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",She clearly explains she didn't do the first scene because she was nervous and was completely naked... You are looking to deep into this.
"Sex, Explained","Lol her and cavill look so strange together, the age difference shows a lot."
"Sex, Explained","She did close ups in that scene, so there goes your explanation."
"Sex, Explained",I think he should have hung dong.
"Sex, Explained","You wanna see hung dong, go watch Watchmen"
"Sex, Explained",Tudors reruns on Netflix. Lots of Cavill butt.
"Sex, Explained",Well they gotta leave something for the next season.
"Sex, Explained",Yes they do
"Sex, Explained",Lol no of course not. That would be considered sexual harassment and not only illegal but against union bylaws.
"Sex, Explained",Even the djinn one? I saw no reason for her to be naked in that situation (maybe she wanted to seduce the djinn?).
"Sex, Explained",What did the grammar give your headache? I'm dying to know.
"Sex, Explained",Moose Gazette has really gone downhill.
"Sex, Explained","Why does, grammar, give you a, headache!"
"Sex, Explained","Agreed, it was a jumbled mess."
"Sex, Explained",Probably should see a doctor
"Sex, Explained","No. She was offered a body double for any scene she wasn’t comfortable doing. As is required by union rules. 

She choose, after watching the shot in question, do it all herself. So that wide shot was the only one done with the double"
"Sex, Explained","Did you even read the fucking article? Or do you just have terrible reading comprehension? She says in the article she always had the option there, she just didn't take it because she realised she preferred to do it herself. 

The title is accurate."
"Sex, Explained",Citation required
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",Dont know why you got downvoted. The screen writers made sure to let us know before the show aired that there will be multiple steamy sex scenes. Its a selling point in most adult shows.
"Sex, Explained",Or you could google boobs
"Sex, Explained","seeing how Gerald didn’t use his sexuality as a “weapon” the way the women in the series did and with rating boards probably blocking too many on screen dicks, you probably won’t see it."
"Sex, Explained",I guess but I believe her confidence was high since she has a perfect pair
"Sex, Explained","I mean, they're the one's doing it not you so they have the right to not want to do it because it's just a throwaway nudity shot."
"Sex, Explained","Sure, you can say that it’s not a big deal to get naked. But getting naked once may suggest to other Hollywood big leagues you’re open to getting naked for all roles. And you could lose potential jobs because you don’t want to get naked for other roles. Or you could be coerced to get naked if you know, you want to a job so you can make a living. It’s not really as simple as whether or not it’s an artistic choice."
"Sex, Explained","I agree with the first part but not the second. Why should nudity matter? If a character is having sex, why do we need to see her breasts to know it's happening? The point of the sex scene is to progress the character's development. That can be done whether we see boobs or not.

I *used* to want to see all the boobs I could, but now I just don't care much."
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained","Are you seriously complaining someone doesnt want to be naked and they should be showing their body off for entertainment?

Maybe you should just go to a strip club more often. Atleast you would have a point about this."
"Sex, Explained",it seems like you havent changed much since when you were young
"Sex, Explained",Most actors don't want to be nude any more because their clips end up on pornhub.
"Sex, Explained","I always find it hilarious when an actress gets a role on a showtime or Cinemax show for example and then acts shocked, like having to do nudity beyond the first season is a surprise."
"Sex, Explained",[deleted]
"Sex, Explained",There where no good actresses available? This one had the best audition?
"Sex, Explained",Reddit always says this and then upvotes these scenes to the top of porn subs.
"Sex, Explained",So real brutality and gore are normal to you but some boobs are a shock? I never understood this way of thinking.
"Sex, Explained",Popular new show airs people are gonna talk. How is it lousy?
"Sex, Explained","The show is the new hot thing right now, and is IMO pretty good so far (only 3 episodes in) considering I don't love the game."
Thieves of the Wood,"Over 350 items were stolen from the set including:

* A replica of a 1897 Imperial Coronation Fabergé coach egg
* 12 sets of silver candelabra
* Seven gold candelabra
* A clock face from a William IV grandfather clock (but not the longcase in which it was enclosed)
* Some Russian religious icons

Thieves of the Wood,I work in film. In Atlanta. Back in December 2021 we had a 100k theft. It was treated like a normal robbery and never made any source of news. Many set burglars don’t... it’s really been ramping up.
Thieves of the Wood,"Immediately thinking of ""An-TIQUES? The fuck do WE know about antiques?"" from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"

Thieves of the Wood,Wait are they antique props or antique props? Like are they OLD props or props of old things
Thieves of the Wood,">“The items stolen are not necessarily in the best condition and therefore of limited value for resale,” Alison Harvey, “The Crown’s” set decorator, told the Gazette.

Sooo... not worth $200,000?"
Thieves of the Wood,Inside job by Netflix so they can release a doco series once the crown has finished airing

Thieves of the Wood,"It’s okay, Netflix will make a movie about the heist that will make the money back"
Thieves of the Wood,Why does the woman in the thumbnail look like Dolores Umbridge?
Thieves of the Wood,I can’t imagine anything more in keeping with the spirit of a show about British royalty.
Thieves of the Wood,They should have to write “I must not steal props.” for as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
Thieves of the Wood,make a movie of this
Thieves of the Wood,Is that that bitch Dolores umbridge?!😡
Thieves of the Wood,"In this age of 3D printing why are there $1000s of antiques being used for a tv show. Reminds me of when Kurt Russell broke that valuable guitar in the Hateful 8, it shouldn't have been near a movie set if it was worth something and irreplaceable."
Thieves of the Wood,Netflix is in talks for the rights to the crime

Thieves of the Wood,"Idk if this is some cover but if this is the case then someone snitched on the set. Production sets usually have a security provided by the local law enforcement since without those, many could flock randomly within it."
Thieves of the Wood,It's them Russians again isn't it?
Thieves of the Wood,Why not use props instead of authentic/expensive items?  Seems like they assumed this liability.
Thieves of the Wood,I hate  Dalores Umbridge.

Thieves of the Wood,i love a good heist as long as nobody gets killed. if your smart and audacious enough to plan and pull off a big money heist then good on ya. i miss the pink panthers haven't heard much from them in a few years.
Thieves of the Wood,This looks like Umbridge. Tell me that's the actress who plays Umbridge? I've never seen either Harry Potter nor The Crown btw
Thieves of the Wood,"as these props have no resale value, I deem this story a silly publicity stunt. move along. move along."
Thieves of the Wood,"More importantly did they cast Umbridge to play the queen? I love it, but that casting decision alone will not paint queenie in a very good light…"
Thieves of the Wood,Holy shit is that the lady from Harry Potter?

Thieves of the Wood,"Real antiques should never be on a stupid movie set, that’s their own fault. That’s why we use fake money on set / you know, so no one steals it.

This is all just stupid “we used the real thing on set” clout for the show and the actors who pretend like that even matters."
Thieves of the Wood,Crown Jewels?
Thieves of the Wood,"Hollywood is already greenlighting this as a movie and preparing award speeches for it's Oscar wins.

Thieves of the Wood,"I rented a location for season 1 and season 2 filming to The Crown filming (and various other series) and they are not very secure tbh… walkin with a hi-vis and confidence and you could easily drive out with a truck. They employ little security on-site and biggest obstacle would be independent set designers, equipment companies who would be much more protective of their gear."

Spinning Out,"They could do well with this approach.
Yellowstone and Star Trek are both doing well.

Frankly if you’re gonna head up these shows with older actors you do need a back up plan in case of the worst.

Kind of hope they do a sitcom universe next."
Spinning Out,I have no idea who could play him but a show about young Dwight and Pete would absolutely kick ass
Spinning Out,"Yes, give it all to me. Just a bunch of mafia adjacent boomers walking around various cities complaining about millennials and their technology before it devolves into senseless violence."
Spinning Out,"Alright, hear me out: 

Scottsdale King"
Spinning Out,Stallone is immortal
Spinning Out,"Ya if Paramount+ biggest hits are Tulsa King and Yellowstone spin-offs, I guess it shouldn’t have surprised me like it did that they cancelled the Workaholics movie 5 weeks before shooting started after APPROACHING THEM about the movie and other possible related projects. Sad. 

I do plan on checking out Tulsa King though ha, maybe one day Yellowstone stuff too"
Spinning Out,">I have no idea who could play him but a show about young Dwight and Pete would absolutely kick ass

young Dwight growing on the beet farm would work

but Plop (Pete) was not that interesting of a character on The Office"
Spinning Out,The Earl of Syracuse.
Spinning Out,1923 is shaping up to be the best of the bunch imo.

Spinning Out,"Having watched three episodes.
The best word for it is okay.

I mean I wasn't expecting a masterpiece going in, so hey it's fine for what it is.
But man oh man does this have so much more potential.

Best of course is the protagonist herself - even cliché ridden as her character may be.

The worst currently is this dude who's supposed to be her love interest. They just don't click together.

Side note - I'm glad primrose everdeen is alive and well xD. If not slightly bitchy"

Spinning Out,[deleted]
Spinning Out,"I like how Kaya Scodelario’s been taking all these occupational roles.

In Tiger House she was a Gymnast. In Crawl she was a Swimmer. Now in Spinning Out she is a Figure Skater. At least this time it looks like the occupation they gave her wasnt done as an excuse to have her barefoot the entire show."
Spinning Out,"*spoiler - though it's pretty stupid, but just in case*

Can someone tell Kat it's 2020, she has a fricking cellphone and she should use it?? I mean the scene when she left the house with almost no battery to go pick up her sister - why didn't she just call Marcus and updated him????? Even just a text my god"
Spinning Out,"Lead actress is quite good, reminds me of Jessica Pare for some reason. But it fell in quality after episode 3 or 4 for me. Liked the Asian chick too. A lot of the usual contrived  tropes."
Spinning Out,Decent show I guess. If you like this genre of TV it's a 7/10 but in general more like a 4/10. I like family drama with a bit romance and also stories about people who are in the 0.1% of their hobby trying to go for their dream with setbacks along the way.
Spinning Out,"I have always been fascinated with figure skating but this was so predictable within the first 5 minutes I predicted Kat would fail the senior test and become a pair skating duo. They really play by the number. It's very watchable but quite predictable. 

The mother is so predictable they couldn't cast normal character she had to be bi-polar to be crazy."
Spinning Out,"I watched everything, just finished... i give it a 6/10, so many stupid things happen in the show and the finale was really disappointing. Can't believe I still finished it. Should have stopped sooner but I hoped that it would get better. The show sometimes just frustrates me with the things that are said and done."
Spinning Out,Episode 9. I’m sHOCKED. Someone message me I don’t want to spoil HELP.
Spinning Out,This tv show is like a “grown up” version of this book called Ice Dreams by Jo Cotterill that I read as a 9 year old. Similar plot except this one isn’t meant for pubescent girls lol
Spinning Out,Wasn't this some movie? I saw one in a Mexican hotel that had almost the exact same premise.
Spinning Out,"Are all bipolar people really like that ? I have bipolar disorder, don't take mental health medication and I'm not like that never met anyone else with bipolar to compare though."
Spinning Out,im on episode 3. i like it.
Spinning Out,Christ I'm the only person that seems to have liked this show.  Maybe I'm the target audience thou lol.
Spinning Out,why is it always the white guy who is the hard partying jerk but girls love him-type? They couldn't have cast an Asian-American actor in the role? Did the role need to be a White guy?
Spinning Out,Clickbait reviewers are going to have so many puns to pick from
Spinning Out,I need more sex scenes of Kaya tbh
Spinning Out,"I don’t think she’s anywhere *near* as bitchy as they keep having every character say she is.

Great storytelling.

Spinning Out,"&#x200B;

Right??! Boy does she need a new agent. I cannot believe she is doing this. I can barely believe David James Elliott is lol"
Spinning Out,"I was enamored by her in Mad Men! She was so cute and charming, but seeing her in every other role is definitely not the same."
Spinning Out,I screamed at that for so long because who the fuck gives up stanford medical school for the possobility of going to the olympics
Spinning Out,"Try **Dare Me** (recently premiered on USA)

which is a pretty solid teen drama since euphoria imo."
Spinning Out,"> an excuse to have her barefoot the entire show

Spinning Out,"For the love of God. TV like this pisses me off. Kat sees the cat pulled the plug out of her phone. 

SO THROW IT ON AIRPLANE MODE and charge it 5-6 minutes, your sister won’t die, and it’s better your guy wait 5-6 minutes more, than your phone die and you never reach him. 

And good lord; call or text your boy while it’s on the charger. She’s making calls and texting while standing next to the charger. So stupid.

This many issues trying to meet up ONE SINGLE time with a guy, and it all goes to hell, every attempt, then you are a wreck, a disaster, and you don’t deserve him. Get help. 

Let’s grow up. I’ve never been perfect. Sometimes my phone has died. But I’ve never had one calamity after another happen, then use my dying phone in front of a charger without plugging it in, and for the love of god, get a car charger."
Spinning Out,"She did, and it died right before she clicked send."
Spinning Out,"I don't know, I like this genre - I really enjoyed Make It or Break It - but this one just doesn't do it for me. To me it was just a predictable plot with characters I couldn't get invested in. I'm disappointed because I really wanted to like it."
Spinning Out,[deleted]
Spinning Out,"Well, my prediction would be that she would go into ice dance after an injury that caused trauma like that to her (she couldn't even jump anymore) not pairs, which is arguably the most dangerous figure skating discipline."
Spinning Out,"I don’t know what you mean by “normal crazy” - are you implying that they should portray just a general evil and abusive mother with an mental illness without actually defining it? I actually thought this was done quite well, as it highlights the destructive nature of poorly managed mental illness, in this case bipolar. The character is well-rounded in that she tries her best with the medical and environmental challenges she faces and often still comes up short, which exacerbates these. 

I can’t speak for how accurate the portrayal of bipolar is here, but I much prefer that they talk about mental illness and treatment/management rather than just making her an evil character with over-exaggerated traits of various psychological and personality disorders. That approach just further stigmatises mental illness."
Spinning Out,I shouldn’t have read this while watching the first episode and I’m surprised I didn’t predict that. Maybe I was distracted by the fact that I too have been fascinated with figure skating and just ignored the dialogue.
Spinning Out,Blades of Glory
Spinning Out,It was a Disney Channel Original Movie a couple years ago but about snowboarding.
Spinning Out,The Cutting Edge probably. Extremely similar.
Spinning Out,Ice Princess?

Spinning Out,"It can and can’t be. I had a manic episode to the likes of Kaya’s character for a month and a half, was put on sedatives for a few weeks and now just need therapy to manage myself. My cousin, however, always always needs to be on his medicine. Everyone’s brain is different, even with the same mental illness."
Spinning Out,"Hell no, my manic episodes were always mixed with depression and paranoid thoughts. Many classic symptoms were there, but I was also super quiet and in my head which is very unlikely for mania. 
Also in the show they completely ignored the aftermath of mania?? It's almost always followed by a depressive episode.
Anddd both bipolar characters in the show were just popping lithium without any medical guidance, not checking lithium levels in their blood, going on and off and adjusting the dosage themselves?? What the Fuck?? What psychiatrist prescribes them like that??"
Spinning Out,"No, no they arent. I also don't know a single mental health professional that would prescribe lorazapam, or really any benzo, for bipolar disorder."
Spinning Out,"No, definitely not."
Spinning Out,Did you even watch the show?
Spinning Out,I hate white people too.
Spinning Out,"Hey, I was a sursprise fan of Euphoria and liked other teen dramas like Elite and Baby on Netlflix, Looking for Alaska recently aswel as 13 reasons why, bit of riverdale and the society.
Being a guy, do you think id like Dare me as its pretty cheerleader plot based, right?

Thank you in advance for taking the time to reply :)"
Spinning Out,Is this available to stream anywhere?
Spinning Out,"True that but she got the call from her sis when she was in her room, she already knew she's running late, so that moment before she left she could've texted him or called him. Even on her way to the car. Cmon there's no excuse"
Spinning Out,That was few months back surprised your remember since so many people online.
Spinning Out,Normal crazy is what we call those women who think their children is their meal ticket to success.
Spinning Out,"I feel like they could have portrayed the mom having all the symptoms of bipolar and slowly trying to figure out what’s wrong with her instead of just defining it at the beginning. Then we could see what the symptoms actually look like, how she finally came to realize, and how she went through the process to get help. 

One of my parents definitely has bipolar or something similar but refuses to get help because they don’t want to be labeled as “crazy”. They even think going to a therapist labels you insane enough to get stuck in a mental hospital. And I’m sure my parent isn’t the only one in denial about what sort of mental illness they may have. It can really mess with you when your parent has a mental illness but refuses to get help because they don’t think of it as an actual disorder. I feel like showing that side would be more realistic to a lot of people."
Spinning Out,"Ya, that was it. But, I think I saw Blades of Glory 2."
Spinning Out,"Yep, it was Cutting Edge: Going for Gold. I just looked it up. She was a singles skater that got injured and then some surfer becomes her partner and they make the Olympics."
Spinning Out,"Yes I do wonder if I was misdiagnosed as when I dug I found low testosterone low vitamin D low B12 high homo cysteine high psa low shbg and blood pressure of 188/113 they said I was confusing emotional pain and physical pain so I ran my own tests.

When I went on TRT metformin and an ACE inhibitor for my high blood pressure I feel great now even in winter. I would tell mg doctors I feel like I'm dying and I literally was. The high bloodpressure was damaging my body and I have to see a cardiologist soon. Non would believe me until recently though. 

The worst thing bipolar gave me was discrimination as if I mentioned it I would lose friends and jobs then my psychiatrists would say the job losses were my fault because I'm bipolar whereas if I didn't mention it I wouldn't lose jobs or friends.

I am never rude or agressive or ever behaved like in this series. 

I was diagnosed bipolar 2 though and they seem to be bipolar 1. My summer hypomania only ever made me productive and I live in my 9th city and 5th country now."
Spinning Out,In the summer I just move countries and cities cycle hundreds of km a week though forests and swim in lakes enjoying the sunshine. In the winter I want to be in a coma. I never have psychosis in hypomania but have paranoia in depression so I just isolate myself so I'm never like these characters. If I ever feel like that I never show it I supress my feelings and do not react I am very good at wearing a mask to function in society
Spinning Out,Uh that was kind of the point that they were altering their doses when they shouldn't have been
Spinning Out,As do I
Spinning Out,"i love *dare me*. if you enjoyed the first episode, come through to r/DareMeTV"
Spinning Out,It's on USA Network's site & Hulu.
Spinning Out,Yeah but then there wouldn't be any drama would there?
Spinning Out,"Don’t know if this is me admitting I’m a not-so-hot mess, but I am definitely guilty of this. It’s not that far out of the realm of reality and it builds tension. Weird nitpick if you ask me."
Spinning Out,"Fair enough - that would’ve been a possibility, but changes a major plot point imo."
Spinning Out,"Thanks for your perspective. I’m sorry to hear about your parent. I didn’t think of it like that, I just thought that the series did a good job of trying to destigmatise mental illness. I’ve been lucky enough to have a limited experience with mental illness however, but try to be sensitive to it, so it’s interesting to read how you interpreted it."

Spinning Out,"True, I am not complaining it was just a thought after watching the first episode"
Spinning Out,Makes sense - I think the focus on mental health is more fleshed out later in the season.
Spinning Out,I feel Kaya Scodelario deserves better projects
Spinning Out,"So ... The Cutting Edge, The Cutting Edge 2, The Cutting Edge 3, and this is basically 4? Now with more cutting!"
Spinning Out,"Apparently she has a kid. Damn, I feel old."
Spinning Out,[deleted]
Spinning Out,"Effy from Skins getting edgy with skating, however zero alligators in her basement? Not sure I can support this Crawl spinoff show."
Spinning Out,She has such a unique beauty
Spinning Out,"Kaya Scodelario, January Jones, and sexual tension with your skating partner? Sign me up."
Spinning Out,I don't even like Emma Roberts (she was originally cast in this before having to drop out due to scheduling conflicts) and I feel like this would have been a more interesting show with her in it.
Spinning Out,Effy!!!
Spinning Out,"She was fun in Skins, but in general, she is, sadly, a pretty mediocre actress. =(

This trailer though looks OK."
Spinning Out,"That looks good!!! The ""too 90s"" quip made me LOL."
Spinning Out,Blegh. Netflix is getting worse and worse.
Spinning Out,It wasn’t an amazing movie but I liked her in Crawl a lot
Spinning Out,And hopefully more toe pick.
Spinning Out,Yes.
Spinning Out,"It's her, and she is basically the reason why perhaps I will end up watching it."
Spinning Out,"As much as I love Emma Roberts, I think Kaya Scodelario could give a good performance too."
Spinning Out,Oh man now I'm curious to see how Enma Roberts would've done with this role. Didn't know Kaya replaced her.
Spinning Out,She’s an amazing actress.
Spinning Out,Skins!!  That's where I recognize her from God that was bugging me during the entire trailer lol
Spinning Out,"Oh no, not a show meant for someone outside my demographic. Must signify the downfall of the whole company."
Spinning Out,Always the big B.
Spinning Out,"It is my demographic. And the only one who is talking about a downfall is you.  


That you don't like my words is fine, That you try make things bigger and put words in my mouth is not."
The Circle,I don’t know what this means; but I’m pretty sure I hate it.
The Circle,“Stars”
The Circle,I’ll give it a chance…seems like a rip off of Are You The One
The Circle,"The end of Netflix as we know it? Once these companies turn to reality-tv, it seems to end their overall relevance.

See: TLC, History Channel, MTV, A&E, etc."
The Circle,"So shock of netflix shoving trashy ""Dating"" shows down our throat 

They even tried to make the Circle a dating show"
The Circle,"You are vastly underestimating the popularity of these shows. People sub to Netflix just to watch them and they're cheap to make, it's a cash cow. My girlfriend and her friends are absolute addicts to this type of TV. Outside of premiere weekly television like HoTD and maybe now TLoU, these types of shows are easily the last stand of ""watercooler talk"" television. 

Plus, Netflix released their 2023 catalogue yesterday, only on Reddit after looking at their list would you think they are in any sort of trouble lol."
The Circle,HBO Max is pivoting to more reality shows as well
The Circle,">They even tried to make the Circle a dating show

I mean, not really. This season was ""singles only"" but it's not like they changed the point of the game to be finding love. Plus most of the catfish weren't actually single anyway."
The Circle,"They made a point to call it ""the Circle: SINGLES"" 
Seems like they were meaning for it to go a dating avenue."
The Circle,I want a version where they’re all catfishes
The Circle,"Cool, season 2 was an improvement. They just need to do something to.fix the disadvantage of entering late on the game."
The Circle,>The Circle returns to Netflix with Season 3 on September 8.
The Circle,"Kind of hoping Netflix picks up the UK version as it already produces the US, French and Brazil versions"
The Circle,> Netflix has a doozy of a message for every single fan of The Circle: Season 3 of the hit reality show will kick off on Netflix on September 8.
The Circle,"Wish we got more international versions as those were my favourite, but I just can't see that happening again. They're reportedly merging the UK and the US versions from now on since the UK one got cancelled."
The Circle,My favourite Circle moment was buddy who was cat fishing as a woman & they had a makeup on a balloon game hahaha fucking guy FAILED & was obviously kicked out as a catfish haha fuck I died
The Circle,That could actually be great
The Circle,"I'd like to see that, and a tangible reason to root out and find the catfishes. Something like a bounty for eliminating them, or a bonus for surviving as one."
The Circle,"Agreed, I passively watched this while my girlfriend had it on and the late comers are basically dead on arrival."
The Circle,"It was less people arriving late and more those late additions just being pretty terrible at communicating with people. ""Lance"" did a horrendous job at talking to people.

Also, I'm like 90% sure the show works where the contestants get pre-selected hours they can talk to people and can't talk to anyone outside those hours. It makes no sense that after 2 full weeks or however long it is that they don't talk to each other more. That, and the show has to have someone transcribing everything they say and likely don't have a 1-1 ratio for transcribers and contestants."
The Circle,"Agreed.  You just can't come in new to a situation when people have been together for 3/4 of a season and have an actual chance of winning.  You can survive til the end, but no one is voting for you to win."
The Circle,They’re filmed in the same building as well so I don’t see why they won’t. Plus with that whole reality casting thing they posted the other week they seem to be making a push on reality TV.
The Circle,The UK seasons were just the best.
The Circle,Didn't they film all the versions in the UK?  But then they cancelled that version?
The Circle,I loved the international versions.  I wanted more of them.
The Circle,like i dont get why people always want to get rid of the catfishes.  what does it matter.
The Circle,What a great idea!
The Circle,yeah i dont get the point of not having everyone start at once.
The Circle,"I think in both seasons regardless of who were to come in after the initial group, they would have no chance at winning. Not with the length of season they've done in the US. I know that at least in the UK one I think some have done well not being in the starter group but they also have more time.

I just think that the way the game is set up now it's too stacked against the later arrivals."
The Circle,"Loved the first two, but just couldn't finish the third. It just got too nasty for me."
The Circle,"Yeah, they're keeping that space and the same production company, but Channel 4 won't be involved anymore."
The Circle,Exactly! I enjoy the show but it’s a glaring flaw.
The Circle,If they are lying about who they are then they'll probably lie to her?
The Circle,I have no shame in admitting how much I love watching this show
The Circle,"Can someone explain to me, why it matters if someone is catfishing on this show?

There doesn't seem to be any reason for that to matter at all. And yet, they make it out to be this big deal."
The Circle,i sadly can't stop watching
The Circle,"It's a mostly harmless reality TV show that's super safe for a pandemic era. The first season felt more heartwarming (?) than the second season. The original contestants are much more likeable and this season fell into the ""all women are catty bitches"" trope."
The Circle,I’ve liked the British version more and it has more episodes per season. Anyone that likes circle US should find a way to watch it.
The Circle,The UK version is so much better.
The Circle,I do have shame but I also love this show
The Circle,I love it too! Red heart emoji. Send message.
The Circle,It's just a reason to get someone out so they don't target you instead.
The Circle,"It matters because the players all seem to immediately launch into this mode of upholding an honorable social order in their tiny social network even though everyone knows they're playing a game, which is pretty interesting because we see the same kind of thing happen on real life social media too."
The Circle,What do you mean matter?
The Circle,"""Can somebody explain why it matters if someone gets tagged when playing tag?""   

That's just how games be. It keeps things interesting."
The Circle,"For forming early relationships and alliances it doesn’t really matter, but for the final vote I guess if you have to choose who gets the money besides you, you want it to be someone you have a connection with rather than someone who’s just been playing you"
The Circle,"The US Season 1 was an outlier compared to international versions. Not sure if I agree about heartwarming, to me it felt more fake-nice."
The Circle,"Yeah, the friendships felt more real in the first season. After watching the finale, I kind of want to see their in-person friendships develop."
The Circle,/r/UKTVLAND sometimes helps finding it
The Circle,hashtag CircleMeansNeverHavingToSayYourSorry ❤️🔥
The Circle,"What's the point if they are a catfish or not.  

Since everyone technically could be lying, why does it matter if anyone is?

You don't get anything for identifying the catfishes. It all just seems so pointless."
The Circle,"Ah ok, don’t know if you’re the one who downvotes me or not but it was an honest question. Yeah it doesn’t matter, I guess those people don’t think they’d win as themselves so it gives people a chance to role play as someone else. But no it doesn’t “matter” on in so much as people tryna win money and don’t think they could win as themselves."
The Circle,"Being fake on social media is looked down upon despite so many people doing it.

Does it matter?  It's a reason for people to eliminate you if they find out.  No one likes knowingly being lied to.

If you're going to catfish, it's entirely OK on this show, but you need to be able to pull it off."
The Circle,"But that's the problem...it's absolutely impossible to know if someone is catfishing or not, as long as you don't pretend to be Lance Bass. 

If you could figure out who was catfishing, then it would make sense, but since you never know, it all seems so pointless."
The Circle,"> it's absolutely impossible to know if someone is catfishing or not

There have been multiple people on this show that have been correctly found out across all the different variants (US, UK, etc).

The fact is, if you're pretending to be someone you're not, you won't always be able to imitate that identity successfully unless you're skilled or practiced.

Most people who are catfishing are catfishing because they don't believe they can win as themselves.  If that's the case, their personality is likely very different than the person they're trying to imitate.  Unsurprisingly, people can pick up on that."
The Circle,ABSOLUTELY anyone can fake being a random person no one has ever met before.
The Circle,"Of course they can, but can they do it well?  Can they be believable?  Will they sound authentic?  Will people know they're catfishing?  That's the whole point."
The Circle,You put a picture of someone else and be yourself.  It's not rocket science.
The Circle,"If you think you're not attractive enough, yes, you could do that.

That's not the case for everyone.  Some people don't think their personality (or gender) can win or gives them the better chance at winning the competition, so they pretend to be someone else rather than themselves.  Catfishing often isn't just changing your picture.  There have been players who pretended to be the opposite sex."
The Circle,"[Circle US Season 2, Episode 12 Spoiler](#s ""I don't think it's a coincidence that three women made it into the finale this season, but only one played as a woman."")."
The Circle,Ah I worked on the show. Was a stressful shoot & we were out on location for 6 months.
The Circle,How are these people not taking to each other through the balconies??? They are ten feet apart from each other.....
The Circle,"The show is trash, but I’m really enjoying it."
The Circle,Sounds like a Black Mirror episode
The Circle,"I couldn't stop watching it and cant wait for new episodes now. I didn't think I would like it that much, but ended up binging all the episodes today. Definitely more interesting than what you see at face value.  I'll be interested to see if they will be able to sniff out the catfish and who will win. Feels like it could be anyone's game. I'm rooting for Shubham."
The Circle,[deleted]
The Circle,I watched the UK version and think it’s the most innovative reality game show format since Big Brother and Survivor
The Circle,"Sounded and looked awful. I hate reality shows.

Nope, **ended binge watching it**. It's fun to watch and the players seem genuine on their motives."
The Circle,"It’s a 2018 thing, though."
The Circle,"I just binged the four episodes and I don’t understand if it’s scripted or not. Joey is definitely playing up the comedian persona and Miranda just seems way too fake. 

I also really want to know how the TV works and how the typing happens."
The Circle,The host making constant digs at even the smallest things the contestants do kind la bugs me.
The Circle,I was amazed by how many people have long term relationships and came on the show
The Circle,I am absolutely hooked on this show. Does anyone know how to watch the UK version if I’m in the US?
The Circle,It has an unfortunate name. I thought it is the movie [The Circle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4287320/reference) with Tom Hanks.
The Circle,"I hate shubham soooooooo much. He is so annoying. He seems like the classic ""nice guy"". Like honestly he hates on the guys for flirting for the girls, but is over the moon when he does it. He hates everything conventional unless it's working for him. He hates the guys based on how they look. Everyone loves him 🙄 I just imagine him buying a girl drink at the bar and getting mad when they don't go home with them."
The Circle,Weird since the original started in 2018.
The Circle,"Really liked the UK version, disappointed to hear the US Netflix version isn't available to watch on the UK Netflix, but I get it. Gotta find another way to watch it."
The Circle,I can't decide whether it's a more or less dystopic version of solitary 2.0.
The Circle,"My wife turned it on yesterday and seems to love it. It seems kind of scripted but I guess that’s how reality TV goes?

What I don’t get is why add new people all the time? How are the people who got there first supposed to win?"
The Circle,"Looked stupid as hell, there was no way I'd watch this, the trailer was painful enough."
The Circle,[deleted]
The Circle,"I hate-watch this show.  

It is somehow entertaining."
The Circle,"There is a UK version of this show exactly the same, I love it. Is the US similar any good does anyone know compared? I had no idea this was coming. Looks okay."
The Circle,"I just watched this show and I am in shock that the consensus here isn’t that the show is fully scripted. Am I alone here? Are these all just bots and confirmation biased gullible folk? If not, I suppose I will retreat now to some kind of asylum."
The Circle,But... why?
The Circle,"it's the most scripted thing ever - unless they actually have an incredibly intelligent AI that can do whatever they're speaking without error or miscommunication

&#x200B;

the way they talk to themselves is just so fake, cringy, and repulsive as well"
The Circle,Good christ that sounds beyond awful!  Did you like the concept before seeing it?
The Circle,Sounds like total garbage.
The Circle,[deleted]
The Circle,"Why? Just, why does this show exist and why is there a resurgence in reality TV? Am I the only one who thinks this is an actual societal problem? I’ve heard the classic “oh I know it’s trash but it’s entertaining and I can’t stop!”. Doesn’t that say something about us? The way we soak in reality TV is kinda gross."
The Circle,"Wow. I just started it am on the first ep. So is the stuff ""real""? How do they do the ""circle"" voice thing, obviously it is not real voice activation, or at least they edit it or something. Also I noticed there are cameras in the bathroom pointed at the toilet... what??"
The Circle,Please do an AMA
The Circle,"6 MONTHS? That sounds so awful, but also explains the fuller size of their apartments. Wow!"
The Circle,"I can imagine. Props to whoever has to type out the messages.

I enjoyed the show. Binged it. Fun to watch and I don't watch reality TV."
The Circle,"why does the show show chicago as the opening when it was shot in manchester, england?"
The Circle,On episode 4 of the US and I swear the two newest members are planted actors. Please confirm 😩
The Circle,Six whole months? How long was the shooting?
The Circle,"Damn, are they going to do more of the show in the future?"
The Circle,Was there anything from the second season of the UK version that didn't make the cut or something that was changed for the edit?
The Circle,6 months for this shit. Man I know it’s your livelihood but wtf.
Messiah,I enjoyed it for what it was and it ending on a cliffhanger fit what the show was going for and left it up to the viewer to decide how it ended.
Messiah,"I’m still upset about the cliffhanger so no, ignorance is bliss. It was a great show while it lasted, but if you do enjoy it, as I did, you will be left feeling unfulfilled and frustrated that the intended storyline never came, and never will come, to fruition. It is very open-ended, and despite saying you don’t mind that, I feel like there’s a difference between X-Files and Evil “opened ended” and *this* open ended. It was meant to continue, but then was dropped."
Messiah,"I personally never choose to invest myself in shows that have been canceled, but that's just me"
Messiah,Sounds just like watching a religious show.
Messiah,I like all kinds of shows including religious ones and this one was just...boring.  Find something better.
Messiah,"Just watch it, I enjoyed it very much and kind of know why it get canceled (possible political/religous backlashes)

very sensitive content and take on such a big matter the ending though..."
Messiah,"So, open-endend in a good way. Thank you!"
Messiah,"Mmmm... open-ended is one thing, but you say ""unfulfilled""...  


Thank you for your opinion!"
Messiah,"Sometimes they are too good to miss (Carnivale, for example)"
Messiah,"I really enjoyed this miniseries back in the day - and it's what I always remember James Mcevoy for, before Wanted and the Baby X-Men movies.

Good god was the actress playing Alia attractive."
Messiah,"The 2000’s were a golden age on the sci-fi channel.  CG was advanced enough to pull off incredible (at the time) effects and people still watched cable TV.  I loved this miniseries at the time and would look for it whenever they ran it as a marathon.

Ian McNeise as the [Barron](https://youtu.be/nlVEJ3Z8UMQ) was my favorite part.  He brings an almost Shakespearean tone to the role."
Messiah,"I saw the original miniseries at 12 yo and was amazed by the story. It introduced me to sci Fi, my favorite literary genre to this day. These productions despite of its flaws are very good at translating the story and definitely worth the watch. Bonus, the costumes are crazy and amazing!"
Messiah,"Depending on how Dune: Part 2 does, I wonder if Warner Brothers will take a crack at the other parts of the story."
Messiah,"A big improvement over the first mini-series in just about every way.

If anyone is curious I think it is available on Hoopla, which you can access through many public libraries.

I remember really enjoying it, but the thing I remember most is this badass scene with Stilgar.

>Fremen : They say the price on your head keeps going up.
>
>Stilgar : Then I say unto you, send men to summon WORMS! And we shall go to Arrakeen to collect."
Messiah,"Mostly a pretty faithful adaptation (I seem to remember in the book Leto throwing a door and Alia jumping out of a window, both of which I think were missing from the miniseries). Still got it on DVD."
Messiah,"I remember watching this when it premiered. I didn't care for the first mini series, but this was a lot better and McAvoy was fantastic. Also, it had a great soundtrack."
Messiah,Vittorio Storaro being the cinematographer on these is the most inexplicable thing ever
Messiah,"Oh man, could you imagine a Sci-Fi Channel production of God Emperor of Dune? Hahaaaa that’d be somethin’ alright. Now I’m kinda sad we never got to see James McAvoy’s face sticking out of a big rubber Jabba the Hut suit."
Messiah,"I started watching it, but got annoyed when Leto II showed up in the first episode, when in the books Paul doesn't realize there were gonna be twins until the end of the book, and doesn't foresee Leto II, I think? Doesn't really matter, anymore, will have to give it another shot."
Messiah,"Quite enjoyed this adaptation, I thought it was an improvement over the original Dune miniseries. A 56 year-old Susan Sarandon (Wensicia) playing the sister of 29 year old Julie Cox (Irulan) was a hilarious stretch though."
Messiah,"If the new movies make it to God Emperor, I’d love James McAvoy to come back as Leto II."
Messiah,"Loved both the first and the second mini series, they were quite well-written and to the point"
Messiah,The music is the best thing about this miniseries. The montage where all the conspirators are being rounded up and murdered is incredible.
Messiah,Does anyone know if it’s possible to watch the Taken miniseries somewhere?
Messiah,"I've watched this miniseries more times than I can count.

Snaggle-toothed James McAvoy is hot.

One of my favourite scenes is the 'burial' of the traitorous priest. Probably due to what I believe is a montage with a good soundtrack happening during that scene."
Messiah,"I was like ""oh man, the first time I saw James McAvoy, this mini series ruled""!"
Messiah,"Truth. He was really fucking awesome in that role. Just barking these long, theatrical ranting monologues to giant empty rooms when he is ostensibly talking either to himself or one other person, sometimes unconscious. He really went for it. Some parts of both of those miniseries age for the better or the worse, but there are elements that hit dead on, too."
Messiah,"Villeneuve has said he wants to do Dune Messiah too so we likely get a trilogy from him. And there is the spin-off show. Not sure what the rest will be, the later books are harder to adapt (they get weird) and Villeneuve isn't as interested (of course they can continue without him)"
Messiah,"It may be changed from the book, but in the show he /is/ surprised by the twins."
Messiah,"I caught this as a teenager and I still have the DVD somewhere.

The actor playing Korba sold the living hell out of that scene. Resisting when he's being dragged, damn near shitting himself in terror when he realizes what they're going to do to him, to the shot of him still screaming as they close the death still. Easily the best part of that sequence outside of the music.

""Time to settle accounts"""
Messiah,I really hope Villeneuve doesn't tone down the themes from Messiah. There a reason Herbert used the word Jihad and not 'holly war'.
Messiah,"Spin off show is still a go?

The bene gesserit one?"
Messiah,">Spin off show is still a go?

I wouldn't hold my breath on that one. Technically it's still a go at the moment but they recently lost the director/showrunner and one of the lead Harkonnen sisters

Given how many other things have been scrapped by Warner Bros/HBO/Discovery - I'd bet the Sisterhood never sees the light of day, but who knows... maybe"
Messiah,"The problem with a bunch of these shows is that the real people are too fucking weird for actors to portray accurately without it feeling like absurd pantomime. Adam Neumann and Elizabeth Holmes are both huge fucking weirdos IRL, in ways good actors would never impose on a fictional character. 

You also have to believe what people say about them rather than how they actually were for the narratives to work for a show or movie. Neumann's whole story doesn't work unless you accept that he's incredibly charismatic, but he's one of the least charismatic creepshows I've ever seen. Holmes needs to be so beguiling you don't notice she's talking complete bullshit, but IRL she comes across like a minor Community villain.

They wind up trying to make them seem believable by giving them counterfactual degrees of depth and texture and sympathisability that detract from their true fruitloopiness, which I understand, but why would I watch the drama when I can rubberneck at these grotesques in the documentaries instead?"
Messiah,A cult leader playing a cult leader. Talk about typecasting.
Messiah,Is Jared Leto ever capable of not taking centre-stage?
Messiah,"yea, idk. From what ive seen of Neumann's speeches and interviews, the dude knew how to work a room, and was def a great salesman."
Messiah,"It’s kind of hilarious - AV Club called Elizabeth Holmes a potentially brilliant medical innovator in one of their reviews of The Dropout. Because having an idea that you have no idea how to execute makes you an innovator I guess.

Reality is that sometimes people are successful despite there being no good reason why they are."
Messiah,"I don’t know what’s true and what’s not true so I’m just enjoying the dropout like any other show, basically divorcing it from being a “true story.”  It’s just a fascinating show about a really weird person in way over their heads. I don’t know enough about the real story to criticize it that way, so I’m just not."
Messiah,Is this a 30 seconds to Mars thing? His wiki didn’t mention anything about a cult anyways 😂
Messiah,God he is absofuckinglutely insufferable
Messiah,When he's slipping out the back with underage fans?
Messiah,Most of his roles have been supporting characters I feel. At least the ones I think of
Messiah,"I mean he is in a band called 30 seconds to mars. 
Also an actor/vampire so...Hard not to be."
Messiah,Yeah he instructs his followers to call him “prophet” at his cult.
Messiah,Look up Mars Island
Messiah,You can always catch up on the Messiah (Humperdoo) by watching Preacher.
Messiah,That's a shame. I really liked the premise of the show.
Messiah,"I wish that when they did things like this, they’d let the writers give us a brief written synopsis of where it was going to go so we’d get closure.  Santa Clarita Diet also comes to mind."
Messiah,"I'm agnostic, and even I found some things in the show to like. I thought the hotel scene with the prostitute was one of the best moments in the show."
Messiah,Interesting premise but it really dragged.
Messiah,"Ridiculous, great first season."
Messiah,Damn. That show really grew on me and I was looking forward to a second season. Thanks Netflix!
Messiah,"That sucks. I really enjoyed this series, it was one of the more interesting and thought-provoking series on Netflix, as well as being very well made etc. It avoided the expected clichés, and didn't preach or force anything, and to me remained very balanced and inclusive in terms of actual religion stuff. Definitely was the best I could expect for a series on this topic!! 

I wonder if the 2nd season script was going to be to too controversial in terms of religion etc...  

Also, that main actor was brilliant and by far the star of the show for me, he really stepped into the role, and I was pulled in every time he was on screen. I hope to see him in other things, although he felt tailor-made for this character & series. :("
Messiah,shame
Messiah,"OK, I can remove it from my watchlist now. I expected something like this to happen."
Messiah,"Absolute travesty. Really underrated show, exceeded my (very low) expectations significantly."
Messiah,"I've never watched this, but the constant 'Netflix series cancelled' headlines make me extremely wary of getting into any new series on Netflix. They should at least do specials to wrap their cancelled series up.

It's not like a regular network where cancelled series just disappear; these half-finished series are still on Netflix. It's going to look like a graveyard for Netflix Originals in a few years."
Messiah,There's no way the could continue the story without losing a big chunk of either the religious or secular crowd. Makes sense.
Messiah,Aww what. I binged that shit in one day and enjoyed every second.
Messiah,Damn.  That was a pretty great first season i thought.
Messiah,"Fuck, this one hurts. All I wanted to know is whether he was actually a supernatural being or a con man."
Messiah,OH HELL NO!!!
Messiah,"Incredible show, so disappointed"
Messiah,Netflix has so many originals it is impossible to keep up with them.
Messiah,"What a shame. Of all the shows in the past twenty years that have tried to be “the next LOST,” this is the one that came closest to the feel of the show, but without feeling hacky or derivative."
Messiah,"Are you fucking kidding me? Can we at least get confirmation if he was real or not, because season 1 was pissing me off with how ambiguous they were being. 

I almost want them to just confirm he's supernatural. Because some of the shit was just too crazy for it to be some shitty convoluted illusion. Even if we know what his ""background"" is."
Messiah,Fucks sake..
Messiah,"I only just watched this.

I intriguing idea and I enjoyed the slower roll out of the story.

Would have watched a 2nd season but whilst watching did wonder if they could (should) stretch it further"
Messiah,Damnit. *Messiah* was a brilliant and refused to hold it's audience hand.
Messiah,"I don't get it, how is Netflix supposed to build their catalog if they keep canceling shows?
They should stick with the shows they think are good even if the ratings are bad. At some point or another if the product is good, people will watch it. 

It may not be the reason users sign up on Netflix but it may be why they'll stay.

It's a waste to invest in just a season if the story is unfinished. That way no one is watching it now and definitely no one will watch it later. 
Who'll want to waste their time on a show that's half baked?"
Messiah,fuck you netflix for making me watch this and then cancelling it. fuck you
Messiah,"It's a shame because it was a very well made series. I found it compelling and enjoyed it very much.

Presumably it didn't attract the number of advertisers they wanted. So many outstanding series disappear for this reason."
Messiah,"Looking at the new Netflix released around last December to January: Soundtrack, Spinning Out, AJ & the Queen, Messiah (even released same day as Spinning Out)

All cancelled.

Seriously I don't know what more to say. Netflix are treating these shows like experiments, because they have no idea what shows could hit."
Messiah,I guess here's another second coming that's not ever going to happen
Messiah,"I was curious where they were going with it, but I only kept watching because of the autoplay.

What did Netflix expect of this show though? I mean, why'd they blow cash on this? I can't imagine they thought it would be more successful or better executed than it was."
Messiah,"Seems like Netflix chickened out and wanted to avoid further controversies among the Muslim community, the show became quite popular and it didn't look very expensive to make."
Messiah,"Poor marketing and lack of WoM doomed the show. Such a shame, it had great potential. I believe most of the viewers even haven't heard or tried it."
Messiah,"Netflix has created a self-fulfilling prophecy - I won't watch shows that have cliffhangers or unfinished storylines until they're complete. I don't mind end of season hooks, like season 2 of The Kingdom, but I didn't watch the show at all until a friend confirmed it had a satisfying ending with S2 in case they never made a season 3."
Messiah,Season one ended on a pretty big note too. It feels like Marco Polo all over again where the series got canceled right when major plot developments happen.
Messiah,"Ugh! Every time I watch a Netflix show, it gets canceled. 😤

I finally have learned my lesson with their shows. No more."
Messiah,"I’m getting so fucking fed up with Netflix. 

I am not paying them for content that gets cancelled and therefore not finished."
Messiah,"Wow, for all the originals they shove in my face every time I sign in I am sorry this one missed me, it actually sounds pretty interesting."
Messiah,I wanted to watch it but I heard it ends on a massive clifferhanger.  Is that true?
Messiah,Anyone know why some shows can get cancelled within a few months but shows like dark crystal have been out like 9 months with no word either way?
Messiah,Not surprised but really enjoyed it.
Messiah,We will never know will we?
Messiah,Fitting.
Messiah,[deleted]
Messiah,"this looked sort of interesting, but i wish the network had given it more context in the pre-show teasers so i know if want to invest my time. for example, is the an alternate-history, what would it be like if jesus arrived NOW, in our time, instead of 2000+ years ago? i think netflix failed to create buzz of any kind."
Messiah,It wasn’t very good.
Messiah,"I liked the series. Damnit! The premise, the characters, the ending and of course no more Michelle Monaghan."
Messiah,The show wasn't perfect by any means but who cancels a show after one season? What the fuck is wrong with you Netflix? People are just going to stop wasting time on their shows because they get invested and then Netflix shits on them.
Messiah,Absolute bullshit. It is very hard for me to find something worth following and I thought Season 1 of this show was absolutely terrific. Everything I like gets cancelled/cut short.
Messiah,"this was pretty good, kinda upset there isnt s2."
Messiah,"Yeah, the show was pretty bad. Just went nowhere after the setup"
Messiah,Major bummer. Though the cascade of events in the show was getting out of hand pretty quickly. It went from every coincidences to progressively more mythical feats and handcuffed itself pretty quickly. Forces jumping the shark and they decided not to instead. I agree.
Messiah,That sucks. Really did enjoy it and wanted to see how it evolves.
Messiah,Amazon pls pick this up
Messiah,Best check back on this story in three days or so
Hollands Hoop,"A new Showtime show? Looking forward to this having a one great season, a few mediocre seasons, then like 6 incomprehensible seasons and an awful ending."
Hollands Hoop,Showtime still exists?
Hollands Hoop,"wtf is showtime lol 

nah but Twin Peaks was the best show of 2017 IMO so they're doing fine."
School of Roars,*Ned's Declassified* was basically a kid-friendly version of *Scrubs*. I hope Devon gets more consistent work because he was always funny on his show.
School of Roars,"He sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. I loved his show, I hope he finds his way...perhaps outside of Hollywood."
School of Roars,"I loved (and still do) Ned’s Declassified when I was a preteen, and thought Devon had potential as a decent actor. I had wondered what became of him after the show ended and am surprised to hear he’s been floating around without much direction. I’m close to his age and am also trying to find my place in my career, so I identify with him. 

At least he’s in a much better place than the actors who go nuts and destroy their lives with drugs and scandals. He just needs some direction and training, it seems, but I think he’d do well. He seems like a decent person."
School of Roars,"i was a little too old when they came out, but i caught maybe 5-8 episodes here and there and everytime I saw it, it was hilarious. Like, they'd play random 20 second songs out of no where. Like P Cookie: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3Jaajq-DHTE

or even the like 5 second songs like when they decide to wear disguises for some reason and then to cuts to them walking with a song going ""we got disguises! what!? you can't recognize me! yeah!"""
School of Roars,Interesting story but it is essentially an ad for his podcast.
School of Roars,"Suzie Crabgrass was one of my childhood crushes 🤣. But for real, Ned's Declassified was such a good show."
School of Roars,"The fact that the main trio, hell, all the sctors didn't go big is a damn shame, everyone was so freaking funny in that show.

C'mon Paramount+, do a revival with them surviving adulthood."
School of Roars,"Ned's Declassified Adult Survival Guide maybe? If so please send me a copy.   


There is a bunch of kid actor's who I thought for sure would have great adult careers but haven't. I do wonder why that is. It probably hasn't helped a lot has changed on TV and movies where the number comedies has decreased while the number of superhero and dramas has increased. They may have to look to someone like Chris Pratt who transformed themselves to get those bigger and better roles."
School of Roars,"Live action shows on Nick without a laugh track are usually so much better.

Pete & Pete, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Salute Your Shorts, The Troop, Mr. Meaty, Big Time Rush, Ned's Declassified, Supah Ninjas."
School of Roars,"""Adulting"""
School of Roars,"Meanwhile, Suzie Crabgrass went on to kill a bunch of zombies."
School of Roars,I loved this show as a kid and tbh I’m surprised his career didn’t take off. He was in Greek for a bit I remember later. And I saw him in some random Netflix film too with King Bach a couple years ago.
School of Roars,Id be down to watch a Ned's declassified life survival guide
School of Roars,"They should make ""Ned's declassified life survival guide."""
School of Roars,I loved that show and watched it with my daughter! “Cowboy Cookie” still cracks me up!
School of Roars,Dude should take a page from that kid from A Christmas Story and become a producer.
School of Roars,I watched this show. Always enjoyed an episode. 😁❤️👍🏾
School of Roars,"I mean, how many people really have successful acting careers, even after having had one or two parts in mainstream productions? Very few people are movie stars. It's a pretty small club, and just being in one show or movie is no guarantee of further success."
School of Roars,"He sounds just like the rest of us. Check back in at 35 and tell me how it’s panning out, guy. I wish you luck. 👍🏽"
School of Roars,As a kid I had no experience with acting and still don't but when they did the casting for the show my mom forced me to try out a role as the bully. I was a socially awkward kid lol so I obviously didn't get the part but I remember seeing the actor that later portrayed him which was neat.
School of Roars,"If I never hear the word ""adulting"" again, it will be too soon."
School of Roars,I would watch a Ned's declassified Adult survival guide.
School of Roars,Ned's Declassified Workplace Survival Guide
School of Roars,Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide anyone?
School of Roars,as a nonactor me too.
School of Roars,"Huh, I remember that show. I used to watch it after school when it was in rotation"
School of Roars,I had a bit of a crush on him back in the day hehe
School of Roars,"First failure: saying ""adulting"" unironically. Anyone who says that shit is verifiably not an adult."
School of Roars,there’s also that actress who was a part of it who’s like huge in porn now
School of Roars,"Nickelodeon shows rarely lead to long-term careers, which is much better than Disney shows which often lead to pornography and several stints in rehab."
School of Roars,Show creator Scott Fellows should revive the series since he already revived Johnny Test on Netflix.
School of Roars,Doesn’t realized he pitched a brilliant tv series by accident just by saying that.
School of Roars,The entertainment and film industry is really difficult to grow up in.
School of Roars,"I would love a reboot of this one, way more than most other reboots we’ve got."
School of Roars,"Ned’s Declassified Adult Survival Guide 

Bring the cast back, I’d gladly watch"
School of Roars,"I always compare it more to Community. But yeah, I agree. I’d love to see him back in something zany like that."
School of Roars,"He should take a page from Zach Braff and get into film production to make his own work.  It'll be starting off in Indie, which is to put it lightly *rough*.  However, he is a minor celebrity.  I am sure he can make it work compared to most of us in film/tv who are trying our best and only really being creative in *indie filmmaking.*"
School of Roars,"There was a period of my life where if you had put the Janitors from both shows side by side, I would not have been able to tell you which one was which."
School of Roars,I had a preference for Cowboy Cookie.
School of Roars,The sound effects department worked overtime in that show
School of Roars,This whole sub has just become ads lol
School of Roars,"If you are seeing an interview with some celebrity that you haven’t heard about in a while or have never heard about 9.5 times out of 10 it is just a PR piece for some new project. Usually it’s an article about some story of theirs that can be connected to current event/news or social trend and then their new project.

Edited typos/grammar"
School of Roars,That’s how PR works. You attach your brand to a compelling story and send it to the press.
School of Roars,"Also a way for Business Insider to squeeze in 10 other articles on this interview even remotely similar to what Devon was talking about (several of them old), from Georgia being a favorable movie production state (summer 2019), Devon reuniting with his NDSSG costars Lindsey Shaw & Daniel Curtis Lee for a TikTok video a month ago (December 2022), some Nickelodeon stars struggling to find work unlike other breakout stars/alumni on the network (January 2023), and actors getting paid little to nothing for their famous work in general (May 2021).

Kind of the same thing how daytime (or night time) talk shows have famous people on almost every day of the week. High certainty they’re on to plug their next project, a new book/podcast, or perform live (singers/band) rather than talk about their favorite foods or opining about their personal life. PR teams work wonders, and whether Devon has one or struck lucky to pitch this himself for BI to pick this up, at least we’ve read/talked about it. Probably would give his podcast a try."
School of Roars,"Yep, most shows don't need podcasts"
School of Roars,"i mean, she did age well, proff can be found in TWD"
School of Roars,"The actress Lindsey Shaw went on to do the series adaptation of 10 things I hate about you as well as become a recurring character on Pretty Little Liars.

Edit: she was moze on the show"
School of Roars,The actress who played Susie Crabgrass went on to play a fairly big role in The Walking Dead iirc
School of Roars,Lindsey Shaw has constantly been in loooooooooooooooooots of stuff
School of Roars,"Austin Butler (Elvis) was in the show too, as Zippy Brewster or something, a background character, but he went on to do really well as Elvis"
School of Roars,The original cast has tried to pitch this to Nickelodeon but they don’t own the rights to the show and Nick passed on the idea
School of Roars,"Ok, I’m not saying that I want this show, but I do want to say that if they do it, and they don’t give Coconut Head the best glow-up ever, I don’t want to watch it."
School of Roars,This idea is brilliant. Just like with grade school there is so much absurdity in adult life that kind of gets pushed under the rug. I think it could be interesting to have a similar framework as the original show to play with that in a more direct and constructive way than most sitcoms.
School of Roars,"""Cooper Barrett's Guide to Surviving Life"" was essential adult Neds Declassified, but it got cancelled after one season."
School of Roars,Drake Bell doesn't care for an adult version.
School of Roars,You forgot *Hey Dude*
School of Roars,Definitely ready for that word to die.
School of Roars,yippee yippee yeehaw!!!
School of Roars,"And they always mean incredibly basic things like doing laundry and paying bills. Never the tough things like fighting with the insurance company to cover cancer treatment, trying to get speech therapy for your kid, or caring for a disabled parent."
School of Roars,It's the seventh commandment for a reason people
School of Roars,Normally I find these takes kind of lame but I have such an irrational hatred for that word that I'm right there with you
School of Roars,I’m glad someone said it.
School of Roars,Coconut Head?
School of Roars,Who?
School of Roars,posting this and not saying the name?
School of Roars,Yeah I had always thought of community as Ned's declassified but for adults.
School of Roars,"Yeah I think the biggest issue for him would funding, Zach Braff was making at one point $350,000 per episode of scrubs, so he had the capital of a few million bucks of his own to spend on production. Not to say that indie filmmakers don’t have it tough, but Zach at least had the cash to spend"
School of Roars,"The sound departament was on point, the cherry on the top for sure."
School of Roars,The Internet is ads
School of Roars,Always was
School of Roars,"Well, what else is there to do here ?

I prefer those ads over people bootlicking Netflix execs."
School of Roars,This is a podcast about adult life not a rewatch podcast but agreed
School of Roars,The short lived Aliens in America too.
School of Roars,She also made one of my favorite games of all time: Enslaved. Great part alongside Andy Serkins.
School of Roars,She was also in Suburgatory for a few episodes
School of Roars,She also did a great performance as Trip in the video game Enslaved. Did motion capture for it and everything.
School of Roars,She had a role in the Twilight movies as well.
School of Roars,"Such a shame. It feels like a no brainer for new content, but I guess Nick doesn't feel the same way."
School of Roars,"Something about it just grinds my gears. It's like internet speak to me, I'd react the same way if someone actually said LOL in real life."
School of Roars,"Wish I Was Here was a solid movie, but I don't know why I needed to fund it."
School of Roars,"This is where the minor celebrity comes in. If he can come up with a pitchable product like a movie, he can try doing a Kickstarter and use his fame to promote the Kickstarter."
School of Roars,100%...i need to binge this show eventually. I'm currently watching 3 long as shows right now though...
School of Roars,"The internet is for ads  
The Internet is for ads  
Why’d you think the Net was had?  
Ads, ads, ads"
School of Roars,Am..I an ad???
School of Roars,"Lmao what do you mean ""she made?"" She isn't a game dev lol"
School of Roars,I really don’t understand why not. Just put it on Paramount+. The iCarly reboot seemed to get a decent amount of buzz.
School of Roars,To me it's the idea that being an adult is like being at a job. Something that's inconvenient but you have to do it to live. No you are an adult 24/7 start acting like it
School of Roars,"Yeah, but even that's a stretch. 

Devon hasn't acted in much of anything in years, so having a crowd-funded project would be much harder for him than it was for Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels."
School of Roars,ok work avenue q
School of Roars,">	Brandon Sanderson and his hilariously successful campaign for his independently published novels.

God, I’m so excited about that kickstarter. I backed at the highest tier and am waiting on my first delivery."
School of Roars,I'm not convinced that Sanderson is actually human. I'm pretty sure that he--and John Ringo for that matter--are robots who write and do not sleep.
School of Roars,Adrian Tchaikovsky too.
School of Roars,"Man, when they said old school, I thought people were around here watching Dragnet."
School of Roars,"I coulda told em that after watching Seinfeld,  Frazier & the first 12 seasons of the Simpsons on a loop for years"
School of Roars,Well yes it’s good for mindless background noise when each episode is contained. And you don’t have to follow a plot through the entire season
School of Roars,"You mean that longrunning, episodic shows where you can jump in at any point and get a full story or have it on in the background but still get the gist of what's going on are doing better than the flash in the pan, single story padded and dragged out across a season, limited episode count shows that have little to no rewatchability once the mystery box has been solved shows?

I'm shocked. SHOCKED!"
School of Roars,I need background noise when I am working or cleaning. Law & Order and Criminal Minds are great for that. I can ignore it or take a break and watch a couple minutes.
School of Roars,Night Court is a really good show. Every cameo is someone who went on to be a big star in the 80s and 90s
School of Roars,"woah, who would have imagined"
School of Roars,I would like to see a graph of retirees learning to stream and one of the rise of procedurals popularity on streaming services.
The New Adventures of Lassie,A steampunk western with scifi elements starring Bruce Campbell as a cowboy is such a slam dunk. That show should have gotten 15 seasons
The New Adventures of Lassie,I fucking loved that show. I'm all for more Bruce Campbell in anything.
The New Adventures of Lassie,"As long as comet is in it. 

Rip Julius Carry."
The New Adventures of Lassie,I would give anything for this.
The New Adventures of Lassie,I just watched the whole series again a couple of months ago. Man that was a great show.
The New Adventures of Lassie,I'd rather have this than the Evil Dead series.
The New Adventures of Lassie,"So, I did not realize this was an early Carlton Cuse production. It makes a lot more sense now, given the style and plots. Also, I had completely forgotten that Cuse had cast some of the actors from this show (like M.C. Gainey) for *Lost*"
The New Adventures of Lassie,Please god
The New Adventures of Lassie,The budget on it could be relatively small which makes it way easier for it to happen.  Wonder if HBO still has its Deadwood or Westworld sets.
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I might be alone on this, but I want to see Jack of All Trades come back, too."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"If he does, I guarantee he has my support without a doubt."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County the third."
The New Adventures of Lassie,Yaaaaaaaas! This is one of my all time favorite shows. I visited a place in Wisconsin that has a restaurant loosely inspired by this show called Brisco County!!!
The New Adventures of Lassie,I just want a Burn Notice spin-off with him!
The New Adventures of Lassie,I would love to see Bruce revive the character
The New Adventures of Lassie,yes please
The New Adventures of Lassie,I would be all in
The New Adventures of Lassie,"i support this, i loved brisco county jr"
The New Adventures of Lassie,Yes! Do it! :-)
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I named my first dog Brisco.

Fucking loved this show."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Agreed, wish this show had never been cancelled, it was so good. Way before it's time."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Bruce destroyed me when I asked him about this at LA comic-con over a year ago, though to be fair he destroys everyone as it's his Q&A shtick."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
The New Adventures of Lassie,How close can they put Brisco County Jr. to the end of the western? they can make some fun episodes with that
The New Adventures of Lassie,I fondly remember this show but I thought it wrapped up with the Time Travel Orb storyline?
The New Adventures of Lassie,More Ash vs Evil Dead plz
The New Adventures of Lassie,Yeah - I would give it a shot!
The New Adventures of Lassie,"This would be a fun revival for a few reasons, but a big one would be the change of timeframe.  The original show was in the twilight days of West, but it has been 30 years since it ended.  It'd thus take place in the mid 1920s, so you'd have Brisco well into the age of electricity and modern inventions.  There'd be better cars, early radio, mechanical television, the development of talking pictures, more advanced rocketry, powered flight, all kinds of advancements that'd tie into its steampunk themes and we'd likely see some fictionalized advance versions.  Maybe Brisco has a bit of difficulty keeping up, but has his son.  It could be pretty neat.  Seems unlikely, but I'd love it.  Maybe a film or miniseries?"
The New Adventures of Lassie,I live for this show.
The New Adventures of Lassie,I was way ahead of its time for sure. One of the funniest shows on tv and the cast was outstanding. Julius Carrey RIP
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Loved this show so much as a kid. Two moments I always remember...




One was with a main villain attempting to go after the MacGuffin. Two villains with scientist gearing up one into an old school diving suit. Scientist says he never tested it and there's a high risk of death. Villain in the suit can't hear anything. Other villain yells at the thick glass porthole, ""HE SAYS YOURE GONNA DIE!!"" Big smile and thumbs up from both. 




The other my sister and I would reference all the time: ""Too much weight."""
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I've been rewatching it and showing it to my wife, and a lot of it holds up pretty well for being made in the early 90s.

If they did continue it, it would be, what, the 1920s in-universe? Could you have a Western vibe with that?"
The New Adventures of Lassie,"When will the people responsible for such things just go ahead and give Bruce Campbell a free had/blank check. If La Barbilla says it will work, then by jingoes it will!"
The New Adventures of Lassie,And Billy Drago :(
The New Adventures of Lassie,I get so nostalgic for this show watching the Olympics lol.
The New Adventures of Lassie,"On my re-watch I saw more episodes than on the original run. I thought the finale was when the Bly story ended, but there was a few weeks gap after that, and I guess they didn't advertise it and I missed it. A few years ago on my re-watch I was so excited to have 7 new episodes!"
The New Adventures of Lassie,You didn’t like it? I thought it was a blast
The New Adventures of Lassie,Same
The New Adventures of Lassie,Just don’t have it on Starz
The New Adventures of Lassie,Same!
The New Adventures of Lassie,You don't know Jack
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I'd rather have that than Brisco, but I'll take either."
The New Adventures of Lassie,">Yeah, but with that son, they'd have to call it the Adventures of Brisco County ~~the third.~~ Jr. Jr."
The New Adventures of Lassie,Sho Nuff!
The New Adventures of Lassie,"It always feels llke Bruce is cursed to get the short end of the stick. Even his Burn Notice spinoff got canned before it got off the ground, and that felt like an obvious slam dunk between the popularity of Burn Notice and the popularity of his character. But then the network just went 'nah, we changed our mind'."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I've never seen the full series.  People forget how it was in the old days, you had one chance to see an Episode and if you missed it, it was gone forver(ish).  You might get another chance in summer reruns, but not always.

It was hard to be a TV show fan back in the old days."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I just, for once, want to explore the post apocalyptic Evil Dead world in live action, and at this point it feels like I'm asking too much."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"No I did but, I mostly just fuck with the og trilogy. Briscoe could work easily on streaming and it seems like something you could can do more with. Lean into cameos like old scifi and western shows."
The New Adventures of Lassie,It's owned by WB... so the only option would be HBO
The New Adventures of Lassie,I never heard about a Burn Notice spinoff. Do you have any more info on it?
The New Adventures of Lassie,Evil Dead's never been about the post apocalypse. Maybe in comics? But I prefer how they do things with small outbreaks of deadite possession rather than a run of the mill zombocalypse
The New Adventures of Lassie,The rights to Army of Darkness were tied up for the show. That's why they changed S Mart to something else.
The New Adventures of Lassie,You love to hear it
The New Adventures of Lassie,"There's not a whole lot to talk about, it kind of fell off before it got anywhere near to getting off the ground. Basically Burn Notice ended setting up the possibility of a Sam Axe and Jesse Porter spinoff as the characters were left off joining together to continue mercenary antics. They got to the 'in talks to do it' phase and then USA either lost location rights or got into a dispute over a key shooting location and the project immediately fell apart as USA didn't want to go through the trouble of securing a new location.

[Here's the best article I could find](https://www.tvguide.com/news/burn-notice-spinoff-1068276/) which is mostly just Bruce saying they're in talks."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Both the original series and Ash Vs Evil Dead fell apart as each left on a post apocalyptic cliffhanger. The comics fill in where the movies fell off and they couldn't get a 4th one made.

Both a 4th Evil Dead movie and a 4th season of Ash vs Evil Dead would have been post apocaptic had we gotten them."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"It had nothing to do with AoD in this instance, the season we would have gotten had the show not been canceled would have been post apocalyptic."
The New Adventures of Lassie,WB's now owned by nuts who cancel shit on a whim (even after it's production has been fully completed).
The New Adventures of Lassie,Thanks! That would have been a great series!
The New Adventures of Lassie,"The theatrical cut of Army of Darkness didn't end in the post apocalypse. That's only the directors cut (which is missing ""good, bad, I'm the guy with the gun."")"
The New Adventures of Lassie,Oh damn. I guess the budget was too high for the ratings then?
The New Adventures of Lassie,"It was a few things in correlation, from someone that observed from the outside. It was on Starz which is already an obscure channel by premium channel standards, but the heads of the channel seemed to be excited just to let the show run and have it eventually be their GoT, especially with it having an established brand already.

Which was slowly working, but then by the end of season 3 there was new leadership at Starz(can't remember if there was an acquisition, merger, or what) and all the new executives looked at the show and went 'wtf is? Get rid of it'. Partially due to wanting to get rid of the old guard's stuff and partially because they just looked at it as an established brand show that wasn't doing as good as an established show should(which was partially due to piracy, but also largely because who the fuck has Starz and that was the point in Starz having a recognizable brand)."
The New Adventures of Lassie,No. Why did you mention this show? Now I have to re-watch. You've messed with the natural order. [NATURAL ORDER!](https://youtu.be/jieaBFJFVDA?t=47).
The New Adventures of Lassie,Fred Fredburger was a name known by every kid at my middle school.
The New Adventures of Lassie,Hoss Delgado is my homeboy
The New Adventures of Lassie,DESTROY US ALL!
The New Adventures of Lassie,"It did have some fairly fulfilling endings for the characters by the end of the spin-off pilot film ([*Underfist: Halloween Bash*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underfist:_Halloween_Bash)), what with Mandy becoming the President of the United States following a demon invasion of Earth (in spite of no proper series finale)."
The New Adventures of Lassie,Clowns hate tangelos
The New Adventures of Lassie,One of Cartoon Network’s best and a true shame the whole series isn’t on DVD.
The New Adventures of Lassie,Scrape and lick.
The New Adventures of Lassie,As a kid I loved it. I'm 29 now and tried watching a few months ago and still loved it but could only do 3 episodes at a time because Billy's voice is so fucking annoying lol
The New Adventures of Lassie,"My favourite episode was the one with the skull head that granted twisted wishes. It was a full 22 minute episode. Pudding with the rabbit was very sinister. Also, the Grimm & Dracula road trip with the trucker that made fingernail sunglasses. Plus the invisible duck that kept farting. And the episode when Fred Flintstone came to the present day and freaked out at all the futuristic inventions."
The New Adventures of Lassie,No surprise when it won Cartoon Network's first [Big Pick](https://cartoonnetwork.fandom.com/wiki/The_Big_Pick)!
The New Adventures of Lassie,"""Hateful fart cartoon"" is going to be one of my favorite descriptions of anything, ever."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"[They caused Property Damage, Like an Angry Woman](https://youtu.be/5vA5c5-7d-w)"
The New Adventures of Lassie,"The alien ""brains"" song and episode is so good. I've also wondered why this show isn't remembered as fondly as others, especially with how popular Courage the Cowardly Dog is."
The New Adventures of Lassie,Please pass the egg salad.
The New Adventures of Lassie,Loved billy’s relationship with his adopted spider son
The New Adventures of Lassie,"It's a really great show.

And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized."
The New Adventures of Lassie,To this day I still quote Jeff the Spider: [“Why won’t you love me dad?! I’ll be anything you want me to be!”](https://youtu.be/1kLUiInKFZc)
The New Adventures of Lassie,Loved it.  Very few bad episodes.
The New Adventures of Lassie,Loved it
The New Adventures of Lassie,Definitely a favorite of mine
The New Adventures of Lassie,"That was my favorite funny cartoon series I've ever watched, I loved SpongeBob too but I liked the ""evil"" and ""dark"" elements of Billy and mandy"
The New Adventures of Lassie,One of my favorite animated shows and it still holds up
The New Adventures of Lassie,Does it matter in what order you can watch the episodes? I see them on hbo max but they are out of order
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I still, to this day, reference the root beer fountain episode.

""Un*LIMITED* access, *to the fountain*"""
The New Adventures of Lassie,Yes.
The New Adventures of Lassie,F R E D B U R G E R
The New Adventures of Lassie,Juuudge? Can I have some nachos?
The New Adventures of Lassie,I think he's earned a free hotdog
The New Adventures of Lassie,"""The name's Hoss. Hoss *(muscle flex)* Del-*(muscle flex)*-ga-*(muscle flex)*-do"
The New Adventures of Lassie,"No joke, we literally just finished that episode and then I saw this comment."
The New Adventures of Lassie,I'll have the chicken.
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Honest to God I can remember being a kid and seeing a billboard with this on it. It confused the hell out of my Dad at the time I know. 

Hope I'm not the only one who remembers seeing that weird phase of CN advertising lol"
The New Adventures of Lassie,Yeah I agree but at least it’s on HBO Max
The New Adventures of Lassie,That's pretty much just Richard Horvitz's real voice
The New Adventures of Lassie,"I love Dracula. He's not just Black, he's *Black*. 

""Everybody know Dracula turn into a bat! That's what Dracula do!"""
The New Adventures of Lassie,"Actually, there were lots of great episodes, thinking about it. Underrated great show."
The New Adventures of Lassie,"> And it's actually a show that couldn't get made today as children's animation has become increasingly sanitized.

While not untrue, Billy and Mandy really stands alone in this era and all Childrens TV animation. Only comparable stuff was on Adult Swim."
The New Adventures of Lassie,The single bumper clip of Mandy quoting the tenets of satanism would have unleashed a firestorm of bad press if released today.
Le Coup de Foudre,Definitely give it a shot.
Le Coup de Foudre,You should definitely watch at least the first season. In a way it’s a complete story that really pays off and isn’t that much of a time commitment and you can decide from there if you want more.
Le Coup de Foudre,"As everyone said, fantastic show. But, in particular, 407 Proxy Authentication Required in season four is one of the greatest television episodes of all-time, IMO, with a huge payoff. The writing, the performances, everything was perfect."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Ugh, I want to watch this to the end but I’ve already tried twice (once as it aired and again right around when it was finishing) and life just got in the way. 

I feel like if I watch season 1 again it will be too familiar."
Le Coup de Foudre,"These questions are so stupid. ""Hey guys this show is widely regarded as one of the best tv shows of all time. Is it good?"""
Le Coup de Foudre,Mr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery and satisfyingly so. Watch it.
Le Coup de Foudre,Not until you've finished your chores!
Le Coup de Foudre,"""I keep hearing it's one of the best shows ever yet here I am still stupidly asking this question.""

FTFY"
Le Coup de Foudre,Yes.
Le Coup de Foudre,"You prefer shows with good writing, good acting and  character development.....?

&#x200B;

FUCKIN WERIDO."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Severance and Mr. Robot are both among my favorite shows ever made, I would recommend anyone who's a fan of one of those to watch the other.

The thing about nobody in this thread elaborating on what makes this show great is that it's like dissecting a frog: you understand it better but it kills it in the process. Comparing the show to its influences absolutely ruins the plot. I'll lift the veil a teeny tiny bit, but only in spoiler tags.

>!To me, the story unfolding itself in highly unexpected ways, something something unreliable narrator, and the exquisite cinematography really pull you in!<"
Le Coup de Foudre,"My all time favorite show, I made the mistake of dropping it at the beginning of season 2 after thinking it wasn't nearly exciting as season 1.  Only came back to it years later when I heard people saying that season 4 was even better than season 1, which I had a hard time believing.  Seasons 2 and 3 can be slow at time but they are all necessary to build up to season 4, if you can make it there you won't regret it. Every episode of season 4 is a banger, I consider the best single season of any TV show.  

The Leftovers is probably my second favorite show and while I wouldn't consider the two show similar, they definitely explore some common themes regarding human connection/loneliness."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Yes 100%. It is a zeitgeist show. In 20 years, someone will ask what was 2017 like. Just watch Mr Robot. It’s not the plot points or anything like that. It is the style and the tone. Some of the best television ever made."
Le Coup de Foudre,yes. it is one of the few shows that rewards you handsomely because the whole thing was planned out from start to finish. season 4 has payoff after payoff that was set up YEARS in advance. tbh it's everything TV should be
Le Coup de Foudre,"If you like Kubrick, then for sure. Esmail loves artistic long shots (in a good way) with heavy and well written dialogue. 

I honestly regard it as one of my top three shows of all time. The other two being Dark and The Wire."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Based on your favorite shows and your preferences I would say yes. My only caveat would be if someone might be triggered by raw elements like the depiction of mental illness, violence, trauma or if they’re looking for something that has lighthearted elements to reconsider it.

Edit for clarification: this was the case for me, love the show but when I binged it I found myself to be more anxious because I got an insight on the things I mentioned above even though I can typically handle darker elements."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Yes, you should watch it."
Le Coup de Foudre,"It's one of my favorite shows of all time. If you love Severence, there's no way you won't like it."
Le Coup de Foudre,"I've tried three times to get into it,   I watch the first few episodes and tap out.      The main character is just so unrelatable,  unlikable,  and uninteresting to me....  and I like Rami Malek.      FTR  I loved Severance too."
Le Coup de Foudre,"I think it was an amazing show.

However, while the show grabs your attention with its initial vigilante hacker plot, the story is fundamentally about the MC making peace with his mental trauma (which is incidentally why people tend to find season 2-3 weaker, since the vigilante hacker stuff takes a bit of a backseat), so if you enjoy great character development, an unreliable narrator (due to mental trauma) that makes you question what's real and what isn't, shrouded with a gripping vigilante hacker story line, then I do recommend this show.

Also, I'm a big fan of all the shows you mentioned (happy to see Le Bureau des Légendes get some love), and also a big fan of this one, so take that as you will.

I think the struggle with a lot of people is that while the show starts off as a vigilante hacker story, it starts to focus more on the psychology of the main character, which some people enjoyed less.

The final season is fantastic and the show has probably one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen."
Le Coup de Foudre,">I really like shows with great writing, good acting, and character development

You'll get those.

>What I don’t like is a ton of Flashbacks and OTT visuals, etc.

It has some flashbacks, but they're not a large focus from what I recall.

As for over the top visuals, any examples of what you would consider as such?"
Le Coup de Foudre,Great show; the cinematography is second to none. I am debating a rewatch.
Le Coup de Foudre,"It's not the fastest show, but it's one of my favorites. The mystery, the intensity, the characters. I personally never got bored with it. It's such a weird show but not in a bad way. I was curious to see what Elliott did next. I will say season 2 is way weaker though. Wouldn't say bad, just a bit annoying at times."
Le Coup de Foudre,Just watch it. Everything leads up to an amazing finale.
Le Coup de Foudre,"I personally loved it. Best shot show in all of television (particularly seasons 3 and 4), takes a lot of risks that have huge payoffs, emotionally satisfying, tense, and the literal best last 5 seconds of any show I've watched. If you like severance there's a very good chance you'll get into Mr robot. It sucks it didn't get the recognition I think it deserves outside of reddit."
Le Coup de Foudre,"One of the best/satisfying finales in my opinion, whole series is a trip."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Something real quick I'll add to this conversation. I love Mr. Robot for many reasons, most already listed in this thread. But a certain character that suffers from panic attacks is the only character I've come across the represents them in a way that feels accurate to my own experiences and I freaking love this show for that."
Le Coup de Foudre,"yes, it is"
Le Coup de Foudre,It's fine if you like tedious monologues about how people are sheep for drinking Coca Cola
Le Coup de Foudre,"It’s a great show.

It’s not one of my best shows ever but it is definitely one of the best looking shows."
Le Coup de Foudre,Great show. Hated the ending personally. Some people loved the ending. Worth a watch.
Le Coup de Foudre,"IMO, it was alright. Way overhyped & pretty meh. Some parts of Season 2 are just cringey, such as the money burning in public and some other parts. Other parts are really great though."
Le Coup de Foudre,"I normally like shows that Reddit likes and Reddit loves the show, but I hated it. It was so edgelord cringe that I had to stop watching."
Le Coup de Foudre,"It's remarkable and totally underrated.  The ending is good, too."
Le Coup de Foudre,Season one was good. But it went off the rails after that.
Le Coup de Foudre,I thought it was pretty bad. I tried to sit through it because I was bored and sick at home or during lockdown or something. I finally gave up halfway through S2.
Le Coup de Foudre,"Would definitely recommend. The first season can be a bit cringey in a few parts, specifically the first and last episode. It's a great show overall, season 3 is my favorite season of television. It's also one of the best directed shows I've seen"
Le Coup de Foudre,I fucking love Mr robot. Go in completely blind. It's better than sopranos breaking bad and the wire imo.
Le Coup de Foudre,It's good but it gets a little too up its own ass at some point. You can definitely tell when the awards started pouring in and the writers got a little too ambitious for their own good.
Le Coup de Foudre,"I LOVE Severance. Cannot stand Mr. Robot. 

Personally i hate shows that go all-in on the unreliable narrator. Ret-conning events because the narrator lied does not mean you are being clever, it just means i shouldn’t trust anything i see, in that case why tf should i care.

I like using a puzzle analogy. A good mystery gives you puzzle pieces but doesn’t tell you what the picture looks like. You can tell which obvious pieces go together but not exactly what it means, as the story goes on the picture becomes more clear and you get an earned “ah-ha”. A bad mystery gives you pieces and the picture but when you start putting it together it flips the board and says “hah got you! You’re so confused right now!” Then you just sit there staring at a giant mess until they just explain what the puzzle was all along."
Le Coup de Foudre,"A counterpoint to the popular opinion. I liked the first scene, after that I lost interest pretty rapidly. I forced myself to finish the first season and even started season 2 but it's not a show you can watch while on your phone but because I wasn't engaged I was never giving it my full attention. Its simultaneously confusing with whats actually happening while the season 1 twist is very obvious."
Le Coup de Foudre,"I mean it’s good.  I kinda get the feeling it’s what the boondocks saints was to my generation.

I think everyone would enjoy it more if they didn’t try to contextualize it with their personal plights.  But 🤷‍♂️"
Le Coup de Foudre,It’s the best show I’ve ever watched. Season 2 can be a bit of a slog but thats because it’s putting the pieces in place for season 3/4 which absolutely nail it out of the park. If you decide you just can’t make it through then that’s fine but you should still check out season 4 episode 7. Perfect filmmaking.
Le Coup de Foudre,"season 1 is fantastic 

the rest completely miss the mark tho"
Le Coup de Foudre,"I couldn't stand it. It's initially interesting, but got boring fast."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Was one of my favorite shows when it was on the air, but I don't think it quite stuck the landing with it's final season. Most people complain about the 2nd season not really having a straightforward plot which didn't bother me at all. But regardless of whether it was that or the death of tv it had really bad ratings for the rest of the series and there were two actors that were probably not included in the last season for issues that happened off set that I haven't seen any coverage of even a comment from Sam Esmail or Rami Malek about."
Le Coup de Foudre,Season 1 was probably the best series I ever saw- season 2 lost me
Le Coup de Foudre,Started watching it. Guessed a big reveal about 2 episodes in. Checked to confirm if I was right and I was so I called it there.
Le Coup de Foudre,"Familiarize yourself with Linux, and give it a season 

Once you see White Rose storylines, , give up."
Le Coup de Foudre,"I enjoyed the ride and it was certainly pretty unique. It gets a little too convoluted which hinders the storytelling and not all the twists land as hard as they could.
I don't know if it ever is as purely fun as that first episode but it gets pretty close.
But worth the watch for sure."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Mr. Robot is great, just be warned it's not happy in the slightest, as in ""we'll give you a puppy dog, shoot it in front of you, and then immediately move on like it never happened to rob you of the grieving process,"" type not happy. Not to mention all characters are fundamentally lonely and/or desperate to their core which doesn't make things any better. As a work of art and as a story the show is amazing, but just make sure you're in a good space before watching it.

I made the mistake of watching it right when the pandemic started. I was like ""Wow, the school I work is closed down, now I have time to catch up on all the shows I've been wanting to watch,"" and it really didn't do much good for my emotional state during that time."
Le Coup de Foudre,If you can stand the main character (which I personally have a really hard time doing) it's worth a watch
Le Coup de Foudre,"It's not bad, but not even close to being one of the 'best shows ever'."
Le Coup de Foudre,"If you take your time with the show, there's so many rabbit holes and easter eggs in subreddit discussions. Just search by season and episode like S1E01 or S01E01.  


**There are no spoilers**, but the one I think about all the time is that the creator rendered an image as a sound at the beginning of a really intense episode. The image was the ""Hang in There Baby"" cat image. A fan's boyfriend was an audio engineer and immediately recognized what the sound was, and processed the audio back into an image.  


""There was a strange squiggly noise at the beginning of this episode. My boyfriend is an audio engineer and knew right away that it was the sound of an image being rendered as audio. He grabbed the audio and processed it and found the ""Hang in there baby"" cat. But what does it mean?"""
Le Coup de Foudre,"Definitely. The story can get really confusing sometimes with all the subplots, but the atmosphere, acting, twists and the big reveal at the end are absolutely phenomenal."
Le Coup de Foudre,I tried but it was so slow and boring as shit.
Le Coup de Foudre,"Why are you seeking Reddit's opinion? If you're interested,  give it another chance!"
Le Coup de Foudre,"yes, but the depressing outlook is contagious."
Le Coup de Foudre,Absolutely. It’s one of the greatest shows ever done. S2 is generally regarded as the weakest but press on.
Le Coup de Foudre,I binged a season or two of it. But it just got too weird for me so I dropped it.
Le Coup de Foudre,"Sam Esmail knows what he's doing. This show has it all: killer cinematography, a superb soundtrack and score, delicious acting from amazing actors, a plot that hooks you from the start, memorable characters, innovative visual storytelling, a satisfying ending and incredible social commentary. Mr. Robot knew what it wanted to do and ran away with it. There is some growing pains on season 2 because season 1 was the buzziest show of the season, but the show is very good. One of my favorites."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Yes dude! I had a completely similar experience. I watched the first few episodes back when the show was fresh and it kinda didn’t grab me. Also a lack of attention probably.

Then last year I gave it another try and wow. It is one of my TOP series of all time. It’s amazing."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Mr Robot overall was a good show with moments of absolute brilliance and a slow start.  It was worth watching, though personally I think its a little overrated.  Particularly on this sub."
Le Coup de Foudre,If you want to watch the performance that made a virtual unknown one of the most lauded actors in the world then yeh
Le Coup de Foudre,Second season is a bit weaker but overall it is a great ride with some episodes being the best stuff made on TV.
Le Coup de Foudre,It's a great show in my opinion due to the complexity of the characters and strong overall writing. As long as you don't long up the plot you'll definitely won't see some of the plot twist. Also by and large pretty accurate depiction of hacking and hacking methods. I would also mention that it's not a feel good show ie you'll feel the stress the characters go through.
Le Coup de Foudre,Does it have less mistakes than Breaking Bad? No. Is it better? I think so. Cinematography and music are better than anywhere I can remember. It has a perfect one shot episode in season 3. It has a perfect silent episode in season 4. There's 407 which is probably the best episode on TV ever. Season 4 overall was amazing.
Le Coup de Foudre,Why do you think it’s so good?
Le Coup de Foudre,What makes it so good for you
Le Coup de Foudre,"I recommend starting from the beginning. First season lets you familiarise with the world,  the characters and ends in an optimistic place. Season 2 is when I feel the show stops holding your hand and trusts you enough to go darker and weirder."
Le Coup de Foudre,"And guy really wants to be convinced in the comments, lmao. Just use this time to watch the first episode, which is a very good pilot."
Le Coup de Foudre,"tbf, reddit gigapraises the leftovers and to me it is not that good at all.

at a lot of times it made me go ""really? this is so stupid"" like when i was watching season 7-8 of TWD

im fully prepared for the downvotes."
Le Coup de Foudre,LOL Ok. Didn’t ask if it was good. Asked if I should watch it based on my preferences. Completely different question
Le Coup de Foudre,"That’s my first thought, like, just start the show, watch a few episodes and then you’ll decide if the show is for you, I could understand this question regarding video games cause you have to buy them, but movies or TV show, it’s just silly"
Le Coup de Foudre,*Tyrell Wellick has entered the chat*
Le Coup de Foudre,agreed. Sam Esmail planned the whole thing out meticulously from the start
Le Coup de Foudre,"I really don't know how people were satisfied with how White Rose and The Dark Army plot resolved. After spending so much time on White Rose outmaneuvering every other major player in the show, it was insanely disappointing to have her arc and the mysteries surrounding her plan to be answered with essentially that she's just crazy.

Elliot's personal trauma and how his mental health felt like it had been planned from the start, and was a very satisfying wrap up. E-Corp, White Rose and a lot of the mysteries felt like they never had a plan behind them."
Le Coup de Foudre,">level 1Mnemosense · 1 hr. agoMr Robot is one of the few mystery shows that answers every single mystery 

I don't think it's necessarily a good thing for all questions to be answered. It's best that some questions be left unanswered. See The Leftovers."
Le Coup de Foudre,I’ve heard ppl say The Walking Dead is one of the best shows ever & I hate it. So what’s your point? Lol
Le Coup de Foudre,"That's it. It laid out mysteries through its run and it manages to answer many of them, while leaving others unanswered but that don't feel frustrating."
Le Coup de Foudre,Counterpoint: It *is* one of the best shows ever.
Le Coup de Foudre,I thought it was one of the worst endings I've seen. It felt like a cheesy cop-out to me. But I seem to be the minority on that opinion.
Le Coup de Foudre,"Yeah I said in another comment seasons 2 & 3 really detracted from the series overall. If I could I'd condense the series into 2 seasons. There's a good story tucked away, it just gets dragged out way too long."
Le Coup de Foudre,"I tried to watch it twice, once alone and once with my gf (she was also trying a rewatch). We both enjoyed season 1 and couldn't remember why we stopped watching independently of each other. The season 2 happened...  We had to keep pausing because it was killing our spirits..  Eventually we quit. I'm sorry, but if I need to slog though hours of boredom just to enjoy the later parts of your show, it's not a good show. I won't be attempting a third rewatch to finish"
Le Coup de Foudre,"Maybe I'm misremembering here, but I'm pretty sure it only seriously retcons one thing and that one thing is possibly the greatest twist in the history of television. Mainly because it's something we all should have seen coming and was right in front of our noses the entire time, but nobody actually figured it out. That's the mark of an excellent twist."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Great writing with a lot of different plot twists, they're actually correct with their tech, and it's just a good show overall. 

I was hooked from the first scene and spent a week binge watching the entire series during the first lockdown."
Le Coup de Foudre,"Some of the best cinematography I've come across in a TV show. Even ignoring the great characters, acting, music, and story, it brings me joy just seeing the amount of creativity and passion put into the camera framing and movements."
Le Coup de Foudre,"It's a show that seems to be about a very narrow topic at the beginning, but progresses to be about almost EVERYTHING. Even characters that are introduced as flat stereotypes are rounded out into complex humans trying to do the best they can, and the show explores big questions about the various crises of the modern age and what we as individuals can really do about them, if anything.

It's one of the rare shows where each episode builds on all the ones before to become even more thought-provoking."
Le Coup de Foudre,Don't ask or read more about it. It fits with your favorites but knowing less is better for the full ride.
Le Coup de Foudre,Very suspenseful and it felt like each episode had a distinct climax which kept my attention
Le Coup de Foudre,"Not OP but I'll give you a break down of my thoughts on what makes it good:

1) Narrative format. Elliot ""breaks the fourth wall"" by speaking to the audience in voice overs, which results in some interesting dynamics and plays an important part in both the plot and his character development. It's probably one of the most effective uses in voice over narrative in TV since Wonder Years.

2) Direction. The direction of the show is just unique and also very effective. The camera shots, framing, angles, are all used to help influence our views, feelings towards characters, and understanding of what's happening. After season 1 there are some very well done scenes that make use of long shots and revealing of scenes as things unfold on and off camera.

3) Characters. Like Sopranos, these characters are treated very much like real people. They get into crazy situations and it *effects them*. We see how it effects them over time. They change, their relationships and dynamics to one another change, and all of this effects their choices and the larger plot. It's a psychological show, with a psychologist as an occasional character (like Sopranos), so it takes into consideration how the psyches of people work. And there are some *fascinating* characters, some who aren't even main characters, and they all have complicated depth.

4) Plot and story. Mr. Robot is a show that moves forward while still returning to past effects. The plot develops with each season, though season 2 is a little more character focused, and it kind of just keeps unfolding. But, essentially, the plot and story is all really about Elliot and Mr. Robot, which is why 1, 2, and 3 of my list here are handled so carefully. It needs those elements to work well for its story to be good. And so there's an attention to all of it that helps it become a well crafted story.

Overall, it's good TV because it's aware of its medium and craft and how to use those effectively. This also makes it a bit too ""pretentious"" for some, because it very much is trying to make an art out of it, it's aware of what it's doing. That's not for everyone. But I think if you enjoy character driven stories it's still good even if it feels a little too meta or pretentious at times.

It does use similar fantasy scenarios as Sopranos, where it delves into the mind of the protagonist like we do with Tony, but it really pushes on that farther and takes it up several notches. That can be too much for people when it happens, but it's not every episode either.

Anyway, that's what I think makes it good. It's firing on all cylinders and fits the genres I like. But your own tastes may differ."
Le Coup de Foudre,"It pulls you in harder than just about any show I've watched. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for almost the entire series, kind of like breaking bad but much more engaging and fast paced. And it doesn't even have a massive buildup, it hooks you from the first scene and will keep you guessing the whole time."
Le Coup de Foudre,Control is just an illusion!
Le Coup de Foudre,"I agree with the OP. Season 1 was a thrill to watch. Personally seasons 2 and 3 get progressively worse, I'd call them boring and rudderless. Season 4, the final season has a lot of payoffs but I honestly don't know if it's worth it getting to that point slogging through the rest of the story. 

That being said all the characters feel very human. They're not simply plot elements, even the side characters. Everyone reacts according to their own beliefs and characteristics. There are consequences, intrigue and hidden agendas behind every action. At times the intrigue goes a little too deep as you can tell the writers got a little over their heads at times. 

It's really hard to say much about the series as it's kind of chock full of spoilers, though. Even making comparisons to other media feels a bit too leading. You really need to go into this show with blinders on. Just watching the first 15 minutes should give you a good feel for the vibe of the rest of the season though."
Le Coup de Foudre,This is what I'm saying. How is spending all this time thinking about consuming media or shitting on media you haven't watched productive? Is your life just not meaningful on its own? Watch the thing and move on. Or don't watch the thing and move on.
Le Coup de Foudre,You’re putting more effort into a Reddit post about watching it than it would be to just watch it.
Le Coup de Foudre,People like different things though. I absolutely love some of your preference and don’t like others.  Only way to know whether you’ll like the show is to check it out. There’s a chance you will like it but only you would know for sure.
Le Coup de Foudre,Based on your preferences I'd say it's a MORE THAN definite yes.
Le Coup de Foudre,"If you like hacking, unreliable narrators, thrillers, twists with payoff and breathtaking cinematography then yes you should watch it. The show doesn’t hold your hand though you do have to pay attention to it."
Le Coup de Foudre,Me when I find the mystery box in Call of Duty Zombies

SKAM Italia,"Great write up!


I'm not familiar with most of these, and I watch a shit-ton of TV and movies. I really like the effort, and the writeups are perfect in length.


Again, not knowing these a lot, is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show? (Nothing against non English speakers of course) 


Also, I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.


Totally agree with the couple from White Lotus being great characters, I much preferred season 1 (which seems like a hot take) but those two, specifically the woman, were very interesting characters to me."
SKAM Italia,"""hidden gems of 2022 for me"" might be better title for this post.

i must admit some of these plots engaged my curiosity. im gonna look for them. rhanks for the list."
SKAM Italia,"How you pick what to watch? I’m overwhelmed with all these shows in Netflix and I always seem to pick the limited series or those talked about in reddit, especially regarding to the foreign shows or K dramas. There isn’t much write-ups or reviews in English."
SKAM Italia,I am glad and surprised Prisma is number one. Well deserved
SKAM Italia,"This is Going to Hurt: I'm a medical student and I thought I'd seen every medical show but this one is on my list now! I've heard that this show shows the reality of a doctor's life without all the glamor of medicine.  
  
This show compared to other medical shows what do you think and what other medical shows have you watched I'm curious!"
SKAM Italia,"Insanely odd for the 2 anime to show up to be an average romcom (with crazy production value) and a good but lesser known sequel.

(Oh NVM I thought this was a list from some website not yours! Still surprised to see MDUD though!)"

..................

I didn't like what 2022 television had to offer for the most part. One too many disappointments for me as well. I mean I watched a lot more shows than I did in 2021, yet struggled to find 25 new shows for this list. But I do think my top 13 here are genuinely great.But anyways, thanks a lot for reading, even if you just scrolled through this lol. Same time, same place, next year? ❤️"
SKAM Italia,"Neat list.  A lot of shows I've not seen.

A few shows from 2022 I'd recommend if you haven't seen em:

- Black Bird

- SAS Rogue Heroes

- The Offer

- Under the Banner of Heaven"
SKAM Italia,Recency bias but I just finished Yellowjackets and really had a great time watching it.
SKAM Italia,No Atlanta? Both seasons last year were incredible
SKAM Italia,Pachinko is the most slept on series of 2022
SKAM Italia,"1. She hulk
2. Ted lasso
3. Ms Marvel
4. Harley Quinn show
5. Lord of the rings
6. Spy x family 
7. Chainsaw man
8. Loki
9. Mob psycho
10. Hot D"
SKAM Italia,Which ones did you see? 🤔 amma take a wild guess and say The Bear and Severance?
SKAM Italia,"> is Severance the highest ranked English speaking show?

Yes. Even though Pachinko got a bit of english too. 

> I'm guessing most of these are straight drama? Language and genre might both be useful things to put in parenthesis for anyone else unfamiliar.

Yea. And yea I should probably do that next time."
SKAM Italia,"i just read the synopsis and glance at the preview a bit sometimes just to check visual/production quality. if it looks like something that could be potentially great, i check it out."
SKAM Italia,🙂💕
SKAM Italia,It’s great but it’s depressing.
SKAM Italia,"What other new anime from 2022 did you think were great? 

Anime for me in 2022 was, *meh* tbh. I didn't like Summertime Rendering much and Chainsaw Man hasn't gotten to the good parts of the manga yet. I was suppose to see Bocchi The Rock! before making this list, but ended up getting an ear infection so couldn't."
SKAM Italia,I'd count Yellowjackets as 2021 TV show.
SKAM Italia,on the other version of this list pinned on my profile.
SKAM Italia,"Nice! Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season? Any shows that you have given up midpoint? 


Like I tried to start Warrior Nun because the trailer seems fun and the lead actress looks very beautiful, also being afraid of it being cancelled (it indeed got cancelled then), but have given up after episode 6 or 7… cause the plot is very weak and the characters are laughable.


And then I tried to pick the ones that got high ratings in imdb, and started watching Extraordinary Attorney Woo and I do like it so far! Although sometimes being too cheesy at times, the acting is excellent and the stories are well-written. Highly recommended."
SKAM Italia,"Dropped Summertime after 5 minutes lol.

But personally, Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good, glad you're gonna try it! I'm an Attack on Titan fan after the massive story shift in Season 3, and S4P2 aired at the start of the year, although personally I don't like rating something that isn't an entire season.

Otherwise Chainsaw Man would be a decent pick even if, as you said, it hasn't quite gotten to what makes it special yet. Cyberpunk Edgerunners is one that would be worth watching and has near universal praise, and my other 2 shows to hit a 9 were Kaguya S3 (but it's not everyone), and Paripi Koumei, which I thought was an extremely passionate show but it might hit as a 7-8 for others. 

From your list I probably have to watch the 2 seasons of Tatami though. I had no idea it was well regarded I never looked into it!

Other than that though, yea there was a lot of meh. Spy Family went from potentially great to just average as it went on, LycoRyco got a lot of hype but was merely good not great (needed some writing cleanup). Personally though Dress up Darling was ok at best, and Gundam and To Your Eternity were massive disappointments"
SKAM Italia,Ignoring some great sequels I thought Chainsaw man was awesome even if it hadn't gotten to some of the good parts  of the manga. And I really liked summertime rendering (although I haven't seen the last few episodes). Lycoris recoil was fun. Spy X Family was great.
SKAM Italia,Oh my bad. I’m late to the party.
SKAM Italia,"> Do you often give the pilot a go before fully committed to the whole season?

I give everything at least 4 episodes before I decided whether it's working for me or not. Unless it's *reeeeeeeaaaaally* bad... then I quit after the 2nd or 3rd. But that rarely happens. That has only happened like 4 times in the past 3 years. 

> Any shows that you have given up midpoint?

A shit ton. 

> Extraordinary Attorney

I was suppose to watch this show too but unfortunately didn't have time for it. There are some great shows coming out of korea nowadays (3 are on this list too lol), but they require commitment with those lengthy episode counts and runtime. 

I recommend ""**D.P.**"" on netflix too if you haven't seen it. That's another outstanding one."
SKAM Italia,"> Bocchi the Rock is incredible TV and is my #1 show of any medium this year. And I'm not even usually into anime comedies. It's just that good

damn. guess i gotta hurry and check this one out now. lol."
SKAM Italia,"You should check out Kotaro Lives Alone, such a good show!"
SKAM Italia,"Heard good reviews about DP but I haven’t managed to watch it, with season 2 coming this year I may watch it soon!

For other Korean shows I watched My Name, Hellbound and of course Squid Game in 2021, which were all very good. Narco-Saints, The Glory and Somebody are shows I saved in 2022 but not started yet."
SKAM Italia,I did hear about it! I'll add it to my list thanks!
SKAM Italia,"Just finished it. I was amazing, I even cried a bit because of some of the scenes."
SKAM Italia,Is there gonna be a second season? Because everything felt unfinished.
SKAM Italia,"I just want to thank you for writing out a thoughtful review with actual information about the show instead of just stating ""it's good"" in different ways.

I feel like I actually know something about what the show is like."
SKAM Italia,"Thanks, I saw the trailer recently and decided to pass on it it, but I'll check it out now."
SKAM Italia,/u/AsocialRedditer I watched it. I loved it.
SKAM Italia,Is there a link to watch it online with subtitles??
SKAM Italia,"Thanks, this slipped through my radar. It sounds amazing. You should make a subreddit."
SKAM Italia,"I was loving the show until the end completely disappointed me. I’m not sure why this trend exists with directors nowadays, but I’ll be glad when it’s done."
SKAM Italia,This post made me want to never watch ever
SKAM Italia,Can someone explain the ending of the last episode? I’m abit confused
SKAM Italia,"Yes such an authentic show. Just binge watched if, so beautiful. Please recommend it to your friends so we get a second season"
SKAM Italia,"I loved it. My only complaint is how >!Andrea!< and >!Nina!< ended, after how special their relationship felt. I really hope they renew it and make things right between them."
SKAM Italia,Could you tell me what your interpretation of the final scene was please... I'm not sure what it meant.
SKAM Italia,Depth. Wholesome. Impactful. These are key words here. Thank you for your post! I wish the show as much success as possible. The international audience needs to know about this.
SKAM Italia,Did you watch it out of my recommendation?? 🥺 I love your post!
SKAM Italia,"this comes with a warning... I watched the whole thing in two days because it was so great!

https://himovies.top/watch-tv/prisma-full-88471.8985172"
SKAM Italia,Yeah I didn’t understand the ending. What did the empty seats represent?
SKAM Italia,why? 😕
SKAM Italia,I lost interest in the first sentence.
SKAM Italia,Never Have I Ever is a great show
SKAM Italia,"I thought them no longer being on bus meant that they got off together to talk about Andrea's secret and catfishing. What kept coming to my mind about Andrea is that they always had a fear that if Danielle knew their secret, he would hate them and deny the feelings built up during the corse of their online courtship(?). But Danielle actually meeting them on the bus meant that he was will to hear what Andrea had to say and wanted to make sure their privacy was protected and both were feeling comfortable in the setting (they can't really have this conversation on a bus filled with strangers). That's all I have. Maybe I'll do a rewatch and see if I have different thoughts on it. It could also be the usual cliffhanger that makes us curious as to were the story is going."
SKAM Italia,"lol i was going to watch it from before, but your post definitely sped up the process. beautiful series."
SKAM Italia,"You were absolutely right !!! I watched the whole thing in one night, loved it so much !! Really hoping for a season two, especially after that ending 👀"
SKAM Italia,It's a cliffhanger for next season.
SKAM Italia,I took the ending as a bad sign. That Danielle ended up hurting Andrea. I don’t know why I got that vibe. I’m sure I’m wrong
SKAM Italia,"Let's also not forget that the last episode's title is White. So all colors (from previous episodes) coming together, to give light. In the shot where Andrea is playing their song, Danielle's face IS light. So the possibility that it might end in a fight (what Danielle and friends talked about before, in the car ride) is tiny compared to the alternative"
SKAM Italia,Thank you!  That makes perfect sense.  Sometimes i need things like that clarified.
SKAM Italia,Oh yes you did tell me! Sorry- I was so surprised that I didn’t put 2 and 2 together at first. Again- loved your post ♥️
Nate Is Late,At least once a month I get stuck in a YouTube hole of Craig and Geoff clips.
Nate Is Late,"Looks like Craig Ferguson will be starting a podcast so that might be worth checking out. 

Late-night is dying and I don't think Ferguson's ""legacy"" is hurt by the guy who came after him running the show into the ground."
Nate Is Late,"Shirley Manson, the singer from the band Garbage, was on the show 6 times. They are both Scottish and sometimes they just talk about Scotland and stuff no one else has any clue. It’s hilarious

https://youtu.be/1FuPXcsYa3Q"
Nate Is Late,"My God, when was the last time I read a Cracked article for any reason?"
Nate Is Late,"""I enjoy ze simple pleasures of Daffy Dook."""
Nate Is Late,“Has there been a muuuuurder!”
Nate Is Late,His show is a big reason why I'm in love with Kristen Bell.
Nate Is Late,His Britney monolog is legendary
Nate Is Late,OMG that brought back deliriously happy memories. I almost never watched any of the late night shows because I’d fall asleep (had to be up super early) but for some reason I watched Craig once and fell instantly in love with the entire show. So I started recording every show and watched the next day.  Craig was so gifted and delightful that I felt like I was part of the live audience — and alone in my living room I’d participate as if I were actually in the audience. And like Craig in this clip I would often laugh ‘til I cried. I’d even get up and dance like an idiot when “Secretariat” came out. To have James Corden replace Craig was truly a sublime to ridiculous situation. I still miss him! Looks like I’m going to have a YouTube weekend.
Nate Is Late,"Careful, Icarus!"
Nate Is Late,"""No salsa, but if you have to have salsa... spicy."""
Nate Is Late,"i just never got into the show but his book, ""American on Purpose"" is an excellent read."
Nate Is Late,"Craig always kept it so real. His takes were always thoughtful, and you could just tell the man had seen and been through a lot and was trying to communicate, not just entertain. And he never punched down! Mad respect."
Nate Is Late,"Greatest late night show host of all time. Craig imo as the leader of the show was the perfect blend of circus ringleader, relatable Everyman, and off the wall charming weirdo that kept you laughing and never got too deep."
Nate Is Late,"Since the moment they decided Corden was taking over it was not a fucking great day for America. Ferguson, Geoff and Secretariat were the real alternative for late night among the blandness of Fallon or the ""I'm old and the young internet people are dumb"" Kimmel mindset. Thanks you round unfunny beige void of humanity Corden. I'm gonna go swap logs with someone this Valentine's in honor to the Late Late Show. Assmöde for everyone."
Nate Is Late,"It’s interesting how late night shows are such a staple of US television and the formats are nearly identical. You could easily lose about 5 of these shows and still have options lol.

I get their purpose back in the day was to give the public a way to access beautiful and charming movie stars or whatever, so it made sense to have a circuit every night that people could go on to promote their wares. At the end of the day it’s cheap television to produce and only requires a stream of new stars and musical acts to keep going.

I suppose booking a slot on one was also a major goal for comedians through the years and acted like a stepping stone from working clubs to appearing in films or sitcoms.

The internet and social media has changed it all though. You can follow your favourite sexy actor on Twitter/Instagram or watch interviews in far fresher formats on YouTube e.g. Hot Ones.

Comedians have also found a great outlet in podcasting and are often much funnier when given time rather than a short 5 min slot.

Imagine how screwed your are when you have an actual turd (Corden) as your host. Between him and Jimmy Fallon (esp the whole monkey NFT episode) the genre has truly reached its nadir. It’s definitely time to try something new.

Craig Ferguson was great though. He sort of realised all these flaws and messed around with the format enough to make it feel fun. He was actually a genius in a weird way."
Nate Is Late,He is the BEST late night show host by faaar
Nate Is Late,Only Ferguson could make raunchy something your grandmother would find endearing.
Nate Is Late,Craig Ferguson was way better than every James and Jimmy ever were or could be.
Nate Is Late,Do we have a picture of Paul McCartney?
Nate Is Late,"Corden following on from Craig makes me believe the Illuminati runs Hollywood stuff you hear, because how the fuck else could be have been chosen?

Craig is real and watching the Late Show was like hanging out with a good mate.

It was never pointless drivel, one sided politics or PR promote my show hokiness.

One of the rawest, realest moments was when he spoke about his mum passing away.

Watch from 7:20 to see why people trusted him. He was real, honest, entertaining.
https://youtu.be/Scpo9hvXitE"
Nate Is Late,Craig remains THE best late night talk show host since Carson. Personally he is my favourite of all time
Nate Is Late,The Late Late show finished when he did
Nate Is Late,His story about when he was going to commit suicide on Christmas Day in London by jumping off tower bridge was the most real and sincere thing I’ve ever seen on any show full stop.
Nate Is Late,"I never connected Corden and Craig TBH...when Craig left I just stopped watching, and everything I heard about James Corden made me not want to watch anyway. I'd forgotten he was his successor. 

We loved Craig Ferguson in college. We'd say ""It's Craigy Ferg time!"" and watch almost every night. It was just wholesome and weird and fun and I enjoyed it so much, I was so sad when it was over."
Nate Is Late,"So many amazing moments, but this accidental one from Craig while talking to ScarJo is my favorite. https://youtu.be/6DJNqcsbddo"
Nate Is Late,"""you're a racist man!"" Oh God i miss him"
Nate Is Late,James Corden really ruins everything
Nate Is Late,Easily my favorite late night talk host.
Nate Is Late,I can’t see Geoff without thinking about his creator Grant from myth busters. Rip.
Nate Is Late,CBS or Worldwide Pants (Letterman) or whoever owns the rights should make his entire run available for streaming somewhere.
Nate Is Late,Do we have a picture of me and my ferrets?
Nate Is Late,"No its not!  This is a man that, for the 1000th show, did the entire episode using puppets!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpStl77s158"
Nate Is Late,">If @midnight succeeds at CBS, Corden may be seen in retrospect as the connective tissue that transitioned the late-night format into an internet-friendly extravaganza...

Ha! If @midnight succeeds, it will be *in spite* of Corden, not *because* of.

Also, this article does nothing to convince me that Ferguson's legacy is ""collateral damage""."
Nate Is Late,"The sillier he got the better it got. There was almost a giddy boyish fun to it all. And the stunning women he had on there didn't hurt, either. His interviews with Robin Williams are legendary IMHO."
Nate Is Late,"His run on The Late Late Show was a very special time.  I was an insomniac during his run, there was no YouTube, and staying up to watch Craig felt like hanging out with a friend.  He was so naturally funny and as much as I love Conan, Craig seemed so effortlessly funny and could talk with anyone."
Nate Is Late,"I look-up to Letterman, meh on Leno, bored by Colbert, respect and love Conan, eh on Kimmel and Fallon but absolutely adored Craig and his show. 

Does he have a podcast or has he done anything recently? I bet Geoff is unfortunately the IP of the network but I'd love to see him in something else"
Nate Is Late,It's not Craig's fault Corbin sucks.
Nate Is Late,Craig Ferguson legitimately made me stop changing the channel when he was on
Nate Is Late,I just recently realized that Craig Ferguson was the one  playing Lister’s confidence in Red Dwarfs “Confidence and Paranoia” episode.    Blew my mind that I never picked up on that.
Nate Is Late,You could also say: Craig Ferguson’s Legacy is Collateral Damage in ‘The Late Late Show’ being hosted by Corden for all these years.
Nate Is Late,"I don't get it. The show needs to continue endlessly for his legacy to be preserved? The man is a legend and the show ending takes nothing away from that.

If anything, this is further proof of what a great host he was. His successor couldn't compete to the point of the show ending.

""This isn't the same without Ferguson. Let's call it a day"""
Nate Is Late,"I vaguely remember watching ""I've got a place down there"" live... Geoff+Craig are some of my favorite comedy shit ever. Pure genius of off the cuff absurdism."
Nate Is Late,It’s funny how most of the coverage of Corden leaving the Late Late Show seems to digress into “remember how funny Ferguson was?”
Nate Is Late,Craig Ferguson will always be my favourite host of any show ever.
Nate Is Late,"A bad take on cracked.com.... what a surprise.

Fucking bozos. James Corden ran it into the ground by being a pos.

Craig was a legend."
Nate Is Late,Craig is my favorite late night host… by a lot. He’s not for everyone but I really like his interactions with guests the most out of the late show hosts.
Nate Is Late,""" I JUST SAW MYSELF IN THE MONITOR!""

&#x200B;

"" ANYONE WANNA GET A HOAGIE OR SOMETHING.. BOPBIPEEBOPBIDDYBOPBO"""
Nate Is Late,"It’s funny to me, I didn’t even think of Craig’s version and Corden’s version as the same show in my head."
Nate Is Late,He should have gotten Fallon’s slot.
Nate Is Late,"Craig was funny and fun… he brought the best out of his guests, never at their expense. He was the very best since Johnny. 

Johnny was the goat to end goats."
Nate Is Late,It’s a great day for America.
Nate Is Late,"Craig Ferguson will always be the king of Late Night to me.

I’m a huge Letterman fan as well, but Craig’s style was so fresh I have to put him at the top."
Nate Is Late,"I was lucky enough to get to go to a taping of Ferguson's Late Late Show in the final season. It was absolutely hilarious. I miss Craig. And Geoff, too.

One of the episodes I was in the audience for. 
https://youtu.be/ioXVgYKC_SQ"
Nate Is Late,"Not really, he will **always** be fondly remembered."
Nate Is Late,Craig Ferguson is the only talkshow host that had actual conversations with guests.
Nate Is Late,That show was for stoners. I loved every second.
Nate Is Late,Lauren Cohen: I told Jeff Goldblum that I had a dream about him singing karaoke and he cried.
Nate Is Late,"I mean... Feguson is a real person, Corden is as fake as they come."
Nate Is Late,I miss Geoff
Nate Is Late,Stopped watching after Craig left.
Nate Is Late,"""We are looking for something more youtube friendly""

Meanwhile, clips of Craig Ferguson are highly viewed and adored by youtube.

TV execs seem to actively hate their own business."
Nate Is Late,Fucking legend. Him and Geoff Petersen and Secretariat.
Nate Is Late,"Ah, when late night television was fun and not all about politics.

Genuinely miss Ferguson and his take on late night. It was such an amazing run."
Nate Is Late,Craig is the best. Love him. Love how he refused to poke fun at Britney at her worst. He had major empathy for her.
Nate Is Late,Balls.
Nate Is Late,Damn I’m glad I grew up on Craig F and Craig K’s hosted versions of The Late Late show and not James Corden
Nate Is Late,Wouldn’t be the first time the English ruined something the Scottish made.
Nate Is Late,Another favorite Craigy Ferg show was the night he and Jeffrey Dean Morgan discovered the joys of facemasks and swearing. https://youtu.be/CjtvhcQcn3A
Nate Is Late,Awkward pause ?
Nate Is Late,WHO’S THAT AT THE DOOR? IT’S SECRETARIAT!
Nate Is Late,"Kind of an over-inflated opinion piece. The 18-34 demographic and even older adult demographics are just not into the traditional late-night talk show anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they start to transition the Late Show, the Tonight show and even Kimmel to a new format in the next few years because of the trend. I know Conan and Ferguson will probably never go back to a TV talk show."
Nate Is Late,"Chlamydia, your dad's here!"
Nate Is Late,"Craig Ferguson was the best of all Late Shows, most of those shows look and feel so fake that are boring but with him the interactions always felt so natural. People felt like glad to be there talking about the smallest things, after he left I only watched Conan and after that no one."
Nate Is Late,Episode with him and Robin Williams talking about chlamydia. They played off each others manic energy so well
Nate Is Late,"He was such a great talk show host, truly funny and kind as well. Honestly he’s who we need right now."
Nate Is Late,Miss his banter with Betty White.
Nate Is Late,"It doesn't really do any damage in my mind. I've never seen Cordon's show, thankfully, so for me the Late Late Show will always be with Craig Ferguson, with a touch of Tom Snyder and Craig Kilborn in the early years"
Nate Is Late,Craigs Autobiogrpahy is pure gold fyi
Nate Is Late,Goddamn I miss Craig Ferguson hosting the Late Late Show. I was wondering why I was thinking about Geoff the robot.
Nate Is Late,"The hustler was great! Watch his films, he’s a screenwriter too!"
Nate Is Late,The Seabiscuit bit had me in tears every time.
Nate Is Late,Craig Ferguson has surpassed late night TV.
Nate Is Late,Love him
Nate Is Late,One ding and we are German. 2 dings and what Geoff?
Nate Is Late,How exactly? His run was great. The show wasn't great before him and wasn't great after. Cancelling doesn't impact that.
Nate Is Late,"What I truly loved about Fergy Craig was that he valued silliness. Man, it’s the end of the day, and if I’m watching Craig Ferguson, it’s past my bedtime. Don’t throw calculated schlock that you taped in advance at me. Be like Craig and Geoff: just goof around and be silly. My brain needs it.  
  
Nowadays, Seth Meyer is the best of the late, late slot. And even so, it’s a lot of outrage and sarcasm. Not what I want while I’m relaxing in bed, not sleeping. Ring a bell, Seth! We are German now!"
Nate Is Late,No its not. The same way Corden killing the show didn't damage Tom Snyder's legacy
Nate Is Late,"Well, I kinda doubt a fucking @midnight reboot lasts in that slot."
Nate Is Late,I don't think it has anything to do with him.  He already moved on from it.  His legacy was secure.
Nate Is Late,RIP CBS Conan…
Nate Is Late,Is cracked still a thing.
Nate Is Late,"I used to record Ferguson because he was so funny, but well past my bedtime."

Because This Is My First Life,"oh nah, she has terminal cancer at the moment, but I remember there being issues in one of her last projects within the last 5 years"
Because This Is My First Life,Jason Segal was almost the reason How I Met Your Mother ended
Because This Is My First Life,Another Slapsgiving episode?
Because This Is My First Life,It's 2023. The Mother passes away next year. It'd be nice to see some closure on that.
Because This Is My First Life,I love these ‘actor shows interest in working and getting paid’ insights.
Because This Is My First Life,Freaks and geeks season 2
Because This Is My First Life,"I never finished the show during the original run and I'm about half way through at the moment and all I can think is ""what the fuck is that screenshot"""
Because This Is My First Life,"HIMYF is pretty standard to me; HIMYM was never a knee-slapping romp anyway.  Where HIMYF does fall short is that it doesn’t have a bigger-than-life breakout character that captures the public’s attention like Barney did (and while I didn’t see last week’s episode, I’m not sure how much actual Barney can help).  I do like how HIMYF is keeping things simple, with the scaled down 10 eps per season streaming structure and the deliberate narrowing down of possible “father candidates,” so, unlike HIMYM, the titular character just can’t show up out of left field one day.  We won’t have to deal with 9 years and 208 episodes of Sophie Tompkins."
Because This Is My First Life,"I watched the entire first season of HIMYF on a hangover day, it's terrible. I can't remember a single thing about it except that Hilary Duff was in it"
Because This Is My First Life,"My first thought for a Marshall cameo would be Sophie ending up in front of him in court, but he's been a justice on the NY State Supreme Court since 2020, so that scenario seems unlikely.  It'll most likely be Marshall and Lily either checking out the old apartment, since that's where Sid and Jesse live, or a run in at McClaren's, like Robin."
Because This Is My First Life,"Maybe they’ll do a scene where he steals someone’s cake, and lies about it despite having cake on his face

Edit: thanks for the award! Glad people remember the reference"
Because This Is My First Life,"A run in at the Minnesota Vikings bar, just don't mention Gary Anderson or tell them that you are Canadian."
Because This Is My First Life,show takes a turn towards the dramatic when its revealed Marshall has multiple families
Because This Is My First Life,COME AGAIN FOR BIG FUDGE
Because This Is My First Life,I love the cameos they’ve done thus far. Seeing Marshall and Lily would probably be the next major one then maybe in season 4 we see Ted
Because This Is My First Life,I’m excited for his new show on Apple TV
Because This Is My First Life,Am i a maaaaaaaan? Or am i a mupppeeet?
Because This Is My First Life,The show is *GÁRBÁGE*
Because This Is My First Life,Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis said the same thing about returning for That 90's Show. Everything they have is because of That 70's Show so they felt like they needed to return if asked.
Because This Is My First Life,"He shit talked the show quite a bit during the original run. Hindsight is 20/20, I suppose."
Because This Is My First Life,He should play a judge!
Because This Is My First Life,"He was one of the best things about that show.. Neil Patrick Harris, Alyson Hannigan and Jason Segel. They were why we watched.. 11/10"
Because This Is My First Life,The first 2 seasons of HIMYM were great. After that each season got worse. I remember a bit from an episode where the whole gag was that Marshal forgot his pants and Barney couldn't stop laughing.
Because This Is My First Life,I worked with a young woman who met him when he came to our town to push a book he wrote.  This was about 5-6 years ago.  She actually slipped him her number and they had a back and forth sexting thing going on.
Because This Is My First Life,So who did he end up with anyway?
Because This Is My First Life,Is how I met your father the story of how the mother from how I met your mother met the father?
Because This Is My First Life,Interesting. Seemed like he was pretty over himym as it was wrapping up. Didn’t he hold out on last season?
Because This Is My First Life,Pretty rich from the guy who phoned in the entire last season.
Because This Is My First Life,How I met your Father is TERRIBLE though. He needs to watch the pilot.
Because This Is My First Life,I want get interviewed for potential jobs I’d like to do and have articles written about them.
Because This Is My First Life,Nobody cares.
Because This Is My First Life,[deleted]
Because This Is My First Life,"No, thanks"
Because This Is My First Life,"Jason Segel's acting philosophy is ""walked in from the street"" to me. He says words. Technically it's acting."
Because This Is My First Life,Jason Segal is a trash human.
Because This Is My First Life,"It wasn't till HIMYM was almost over that I found out Segal was in the show, never would have pictured him in a sitcom from watching his movies back in the day"
Because This Is My First Life,No shit?
Because This Is My First Life,Still sad he never ate Dog Shirt's picture
Because This Is My First Life,How I Met Your Father ? 😬
Because This Is My First Life,"I met this man in philly, what an angel"
Because This Is My First Life,While i found zero reason to continue watching HIMYF I get where Segel is coming from and knowing how to appreciate something that has helped define your career.
Because This Is My First Life,Surprised me. He was the first who wanted to wuit HIMYM back then.
Because This Is My First Life,How does Jonah Hills new film mean he's down for HIMYF?
Because This Is My First Life,Doesn’t matter no will see it. People hated the ending so much it cursed the spin offs.
Because This Is My First Life,"is HIMYF any good?  I've not really heard anything good or bad about it, so I'm guessing it's fairly mediocre?"
Because This Is My First Life,“Those people…” 🙄
Because This Is My First Life,"I have no idea why people liked this show, it was absolute garbage."
Because This Is My First Life,I hope one of the himyf crew gets a ticket or gets arrested and has to appear in front of Judge Fudge.
Because This Is My First Life,"That show needs something because it lacks everything that made How I Met Your Mother so compelling. I honestly think they should have done it from The Mother's perspective as she's laying in the hospital before she passes away. That would have made a more compelling show than having a show that is set in the same location as the previous, with no connection to the original other than side characters existing due to it taking place in the same area."
Because This Is My First Life,How so?
Because This Is My First Life,"Then thank you Jason.

That show went on like 4 season too long"
Because This Is My First Life,"Slaps, “sandwiches”, and Barney’s catch phrases…."
Because This Is My First Life,"The slaps were a great mechanic to write around. It did eventually get a little long in the tooth, but the first few bits they did of it was hysterical."
Because This Is My First Life,I feel like it would be something related to him being a judge for a character's legal issue.
Because This Is My First Life,Or we can just pretend that never happens.
Because This Is My First Life,"Not watching the show, are they actually connected? Is it Barney's daughter's story?"

Because This Is My First Life,"The best one was yesterday I saw Eddie Murphy was really down for making a Donkey movie, yeah like no shit mate. Get paid millions to record a voice in a booth…who wouldn’t be up for that."
Because This Is My First Life,"Timothy Chamelet interested in doing “Dune” sequel.

Human interested in having cheeseburger again later because they die if they don’t eat every so often."
Because This Is My First Life,Buzz probably helps the studios gage interest.
Because This Is My First Life,"Tobey Maguire is open to wear spiderman suit if Disney offers the role!

You know what, people are mostly open to make millions of dollars. How surprising!"
Because This Is My First Life,"jason segel hasn't been in anything in ages. Only recently did i see him in an ad for something on streaming. Even if your big mansion in malibu is all paid for and you can eat fining dining every day for the rest of your days, the irrelevence must get to everyone."
Because This Is My First Life,"Especially since he was sick of the show by the end and wanted out. He was the only person who was holding out for the last tacked on season and finally relented. I guess when work dries up after the show. Suddenly they’re cool with that show that helped them buy things. 

Reminds me of an article about Daisy Ridley is up to returning to Star Wars. 

It’s “actor is up for doing work. Filmed at 11”"
Because This Is My First Life,Be still my beating heart.
Because This Is My First Life,I'd love it if they did a Freaks and Geeks season 2 that was like the Wet Hot American Summer prequel series - everybody is visibly 20 years older but everyone is still acting like they're all teenagers.
Because This Is My First Life,If you want to know it's an episode of the season 9.
Because This Is My First Life,That’s Marshall and the Night Falcon. Don’t ask.
Because This Is My First Life,No questions asked.
Because This Is My First Life,"> HIMYM was never a knee-slapping romp anyway.

It was a nice, goofy show. Didn't take itself seriously. Good Monday night fodder. 

The whole lineup around 2009 on CBS on Mondays worked - those shows taken together were better than they were separately."
Because This Is My First Life,"It’s not that it lacks a “breakout character,” it’s that it lacks the situational comedy of the old show. The old show had a format where in most episodes early on

* The gang is all hanging out together  
* Someone shares a story about their life  
* One of the group says “oh yeah” and introduces concept X, a new one each episode  
* The remaining episode is situational comedy playing out concept X

The reason why people loved Barney is that he frequently got to be the guy introducing some of the series’ funniest concepts. But most episodes were like this, and they’d spread it around.

The new show has none of this. It’s not that they do it and it misses - they don’t even really try. The *pilot* of HIMYM has Ted explaining “olive theory” to his friends, the conceptual stuff is in the show from the very beginning. In all of the first season of HIMYF they don’t even dip into this style, and so it lacks the most distinctive part of HIMYF. It can work without NPH, it just can’t work without any of the types of jokes people loved."
Because This Is My First Life,"> I do like how HIMYF is keeping things simple, with the scaled down 10 eps per season

Season 2 is going to be 20 episodes."
Because This Is My First Life,Actually season 2 is 20 episodes long
Because This Is My First Life,Barney as a character has also really not aged well.
Because This Is My First Life,"Schlocky comedy like this really need to have the audience relating to the situation. I couldn't relate at all to the main character or Barney so it's kind of lost on me. Everybody loves Raymond does, however."
Because This Is My First Life,"What really need and what how I met your mother sold me aside of Barnie, was the websites they did like www.tedmosbyisajerk.com or http://tedmosbyisnotajerk.com http://www.guyforceshiswifetodressinagarbagebagforthenextthreeyears.com/"
Because This Is My First Life,[deleted]
Because This Is My First Life,"It’s sort of like HIMYM or FRIENDS. Without the cult like following. I do not look at these shows as “substance” or “gripping” or take them seriously. I look at them as “fluff,” background tv that is low commitment, zero stress, doesn’t force you to think, just like”brain drain” ambient shows. Just…..easy. Predictable. A break from daily news intensity or a day of heavy work brain engagement. You’re gonna be disappointed if you think it’s supposed to be awesome acting, riveting plotlines, deeply transformative character arcs, etc. just a cheesy, goofy characters, dorky dialogue, simple sitcom. That’s ok.

Check out this article from the New Yorker: [““Emily in Paris” and the Rise of Ambient TV”](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcultural-comment%2Femily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv)

“As with soaps and chores, the current flow of ambient television provides a numbing backdrop to the rest of our digital consumption: feeds of fragmented text, imagery, and video algorithmically sorted to be as provocative as possible. Ambience offers the increasingly rare possibility of disengagement while still staring at a screen.”

This is how I see this show.

Live Up To Your Name,Terra Nova
Live Up To Your Name,"The Flash.

Maybe I'd been spoilt by AoS on how cool a comic book show could (eventually) be, or even Arrow - he didn't have any superpowers, but at least he didn't stand around letting his enemies monologue and do evil shit while he could just punch them at hypersonic speeds."
Live Up To Your Name,"Sleepy Hollow. 

The first season is a cult favorite. The story was interesting. It was actually scary. It was the right sort of campy. The characters were fun. It had John Cho and Clancy Brown in it! It had everything going for it. But then, for some reason that not a single fan understands, the showrunner decided to take our horror show about a man who is thrown back from the American revolution to modern times to team up with a local cop to stop a demon to an urban fantasy about a man thrown back in time to modern times who now is in a dysfunctional family drama with his suddenly evil witch wife, who was good last season, and his son and his ex-best friend. That made everyone go....wait, what? And it only became worse after that. So much worse. 

Even now, fans of the show will tell you to watch the first season and stop. Because, again, the first season was so much fun. The rest.......sigh....we don't want to talk about it...."

Live Up To Your Name,"*Halo* could have been great. 4+ ancient races all fighting for control of the galaxy for completely different reasons.

Instead we got nepotism drama and flash clones"
Live Up To Your Name,"Star Trek Voyager. An interesting premise with an interesting cast of characters that is completely squandered almost from the first episode. And once Seven of Nine is added to the show, the writers give up any semblance of caring about anyone else on the show. At least with Enterprise, they try and salvage the situation in the latter two seasons. With Voyager, the producers were content to coast on mediocrity for seven years with only the occasional hint of what the show could have been if someone gave a shit."
Live Up To Your Name,Westworld.
Live Up To Your Name,Suits
Live Up To Your Name,"> The show I have in mind for this is The Man in the High Castle. A truly unique premise and one of the best acting performances I have ever seen, in Rufus Sewell

Incredible performance by Sewell and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa both!

Such a disappointing series!"
Live Up To Your Name,Studio 60 on the sunset strip
Live Up To Your Name,"*The Cape*. The premise was brilliant: honest cop fighting corruption in the big city is forced to fake his death to protect his family, hides out with a traveling circus, and assumes the identity of a masked crimefighter with a special prehensile cape that can perform incredible feats such as deflecting bullets. 

It should have been badass. Instead it was terribly disappointing.

Somehow the showrunners screwed up nearly every production decision. The writing, the cinematography, the sets, the costuming, the music, the overall atmosphere they were shooting for--everything was off. It wasn't bad in the usual sense of being mediocre and dull, but it was offputting, jarring, and upsetting. It was anti-rhythm.

The show zigged when it should have zagged, and vice versa. Every time! It was like dancing with a partner who always manages to step on your foot.

They had some excellent actors (Keith David, James Frain, Jennifer Ferrin) but otherwise it maintained this frustrating quality throughout.

Here's one example of the show's endless inexplicable choices. Frain played the antagonist, Chess, who had a split personality between a business magnate and a megalomaniacal supervillain with Machiavellian strategic prowess. When he assumed the Chess persona...wait for it...his pupils took on the shape of chess pieces! 

Like I said, some real bizarre production decisions and strange conceits.

For some reason I watched every episode (except the series finale, which was only released online), hoping the showrunners would figure it out. They never did. The show never even improved. Clearly the showrunners thought they had perfected the show, and they stuck to all their decisions throughout.

It was like a teenager watched a Tim Burton movie, got all worked up about and decided to make a show just like it, and excitedly posted all his half-baked ideas on some online forum. And then someone actually decided to turn that post into a TV show.

In the hands of halfway competent showrunners it would have been great--an atmospheric, surreal retro superhero show with a carnival theme, a fresh new take on the Batman-style vigilante. Instead it was 11 episodes of bafflement and consternation.

Shit, even the CW could have done better. At least they had a formula that worked, and if they had applied it to this premise, the result would've been watchable and entertaining. Instead, like I said, it was disappointing and offputting."
Live Up To Your Name,"Vinyl 

Did you forget about this show? Yeah. Everyone did. Huge hyped HBO show about the 70s music industry. Martin Scorsese wrote and directed the first episodes, which was basically a movie, star studded cast and producers including Mick Jagger, Scorsese, and Bobby Cannavale (fresh off an Emmy)

Marketed and advertised literally everywhere. Probably a $200M ad campaign. HBO talks of it being to music what Sopranos was to mafia or The Wire to crime 

Most people couldn’t even get through the first episode. It was bad."
Live Up To Your Name,"I don't have any that I am upset about.

Shows that could have been great:

-  Zoo

Post apocalyptic stuff was all the rage when it came out. It had a great cast and pretty cool take on it.  Lord did it go no where fast."
Live Up To Your Name,"Avenue 5.  I love Iannucci’s other work, Hugh Laurie and Zach Woods are both phenomenal, and the premise seemed to have endless potential.  But I think laughed maybe twice in the entire first season, and I doubt I’ll even bother watching the second."
Live Up To Your Name,US version of Utopia (Amazon) (2020).
Live Up To Your Name,"That short-lived NBC show with Ian McShane called Kings. Great concept. Horribly melodramatic writing and on the nose themes.

Also — Century City. Lawyer show set in the future wrestling with science fiction ideas. Awful execution."
Live Up To Your Name,"The Witcher. It's not *bad*, but with the source material, the further work CDPR put in, the budget and the casting, it should have been brilliant. They had the home run all set up."
Live Up To Your Name,"Human Target. Season 1 was great, season 2 was a disaster."
Live Up To Your Name,Roadies on Showtime
Live Up To Your Name,"Once Upon a Time. Though part of the problem was the acting at times. Such a cool premise - fairytale characters that have no idea who they really are stuck in the real world, cool flashbacks so that we know who they are, amazing costumes in the fairytale world. Really shit CGI and unfortunate direction and/or writing just make me wish that someone would redo this series but better."
Live Up To Your Name,"The Mist - could’ve been so much better. I didn’t mind the depart from the film as it was still a scary idea.

Resident Evil - what a waste of a franchise.

24: Legacy. I flippin loved 24 but the reboot flop showed how much Kiefer Sutherland carried the whole thing. If they ever do a reboot they need to pick a real talent to replace him.

Space Force - I was hoping for something to rival The Office but it just wasn’t very funny.

Altered Carbon - great first season then fell off a cliff."
Live Up To Your Name,"I'm not really upset about it, but Stargate Universe could have been something great but they wasted two seasons on absolute shit. 

A group of humans, trapped on a the oldest ship in the universe which is currently like 50 galaxies away from home, and has spent countless millennia investigating a hidden signal encoded in the Big Bang? Awesome

But nah, let's solely focus on who is fucking who, and use the magic sex stones to inhabit other people's bodies back on Earth and have sex with more people. 

Some of the show's real potential was starting to come through near the end of Season 2, but they deserved to get canned by that point."
Live Up To Your Name,"That show Becker, you know, with Ted Danson? I watched the entire run of that show, hoping it would get better, and it never did. It had all the right pieces, but it just couldn't put them together. And when it got canceled, I was really bummed out, not because I liked the show, but because I knew it could be so much better, and now it never would be."
Live Up To Your Name,"Legacies

It should have been a school about three factions learning how to deal with their parents past history and learning about how not to be like their parents. 

Instead we got four fucking seasons about Landon, who’s not even a main character, a dude who melted into goo after having sex. The show was barely about Hope after the second season. 

Plus a personal aside, should have gotten Hope and Josie not Hope and Landon."
Live Up To Your Name,"Seaquest: DSV (And even 2032). Season 1 of Seaquest was great, had good hard science fiction aspects. Season 2 had to get ""younger"" and less futuristic sci-fi to stupid sci-fi. Season 3 (2032) went into more militaristic and did it well I thought but could not recover from the disaster of season 2."
Live Up To Your Name,"Kenobi will never not upset me. I was a hardcore prequel memer during the first bout of lockdowns, one of my memes is still on the 1st page on top all time, and news of the Kenobi series just got me soooo freakin pumped.

There is a great show hidden in there, and it'll take a very creative fan edit to make it as good as it can be, so until then, I'm just holding out hope someone on r/fanedits can actually make a decent one."
Live Up To Your Name,Revolution. Anyone remember this show? God damn did it have potential.
Live Up To Your Name,The Witcher. The first season was a mess but had its charm. I figured they would tighten it up in season 2 but instead it took a massive nosedive with writing that was just plain awful. Maybe they'll turn it around this next season but I'm not optimistic.

Live Up To Your Name,"""Awake"" for rushed ending."
Live Up To Your Name,"Altered Carbon. Forever pissed that the books will never have a show that does them justice. The tone of the first season was spot on. Storywise, all they had to do was follow the source material and they would have a masterpiece. That they instead chose a generic action story with elements and characters from the source material hacked together seemingly at random continues to baffle and upset me."
Live Up To Your Name,"* Westworld, still can't believe that it turned into a generic scifi with okayish writing after that masterpiece that was season 1
* The Wheel of Time, because I love the books and the show was unrecognizable for me

* Rings of Power, I don't hate it but with how pretty it is, the writing is kinda meh"
Live Up To Your Name,G.l.o.w

Live Up To Your Name,"Penny Dreadful is the first one that comes to mind. 

Fantastic worldbuilding and character development and such a great gothic horror vibe. They managed to weave together so many disparate horror characters in a way that really felt organic. 

And then they rushed the end to shit, granted it was getting cancelled, but I honestly would have preferred it to end on a cliffhanger to what we ended up getting."

I really held out hope for The First Colony to be the main premise of the first season. It was horrible."
Live Up To Your Name,"Y The Last Man and Kenobi. Both shows that probably just never should have been made and only existed as fan’s dreams. Y The Last Man was such a slog, and was so dour. Kenobi’s flaws have been discussed to death so no need to relitigate here"
Live Up To Your Name,The River. Cancelled after one season 10 years ago and I’m still upset about it.
Live Up To Your Name,"The Walking Dead

I LOVED that show early on.  At some point it just devolved into finding different ways to torture the characters.  Progress was never made.  Nobody figured anything out.  I don’t remember which season I bailed on but I can’t believe people stuck with that show for so long."
Live Up To Your Name,Wheel of Time
Live Up To Your Name,"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Great cast, Aaron Sorkin's first post-West Wing project, a really good pilot ... then a crash and burn. It committed a cardinal sin of telling us that all the show's cast members were funny rather than showing us that they were funny.

(In a similar vein: The Newsroom.)"
Live Up To Your Name,"Rings of Power. It had \*everything\* going for it and I was stupid excited. And then the creatives started talking, and that stupid teaser with the name plate thing dropped, and then those god awful superfan videos, and then more creatives talking and then the actual show which turned out to be just... aggressively meh with the dialogue and the characters and the Oh My God How Does Amazon Not Expect All of Us to Know Halbrand is Sauron Because DUH?!  Maybe they'll take the criticism to heart and season 2 will be better."

Live Up To Your Name,"Almost Human.  Ever since Ghost In The Shell: Standalone Complex, I've been yearning for a decent cyberpunk police procedural.  Almost Human sort of worked but didn't live up to its potential."
Live Up To Your Name,"So much stuff... Heroes, Sleepy Hollow, Terra Nova,  The Cape, Westworld, Penny Dreadful, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I feel like if you say the name of a series, there is a 50% chance that the premise is better than the what we got."
Live Up To Your Name,The 2006 Robin Hood tv series
Live Up To Your Name,"Grimm. The show had a really good shot at being the next Buffy, even having David Greenwalt as showrunner. Unfortunately, the show took way too long to find its footing, and they spent too much time on monster of the week episodes that didn't really go anywhere. It should have had a stronger seasonal arc sprinkled throughout the season (like Buffy), but it felt like an afterthought most of the time. Then, by the time they tried to do a seasonal plot, all the characters were so spread out that it never felt cohesive.

 It tried to be too much of a cop show than an Urban Fantasy, and once it did, it was a little too late. It was also very frustrating having half the cast not being aware of what the other half was doing just to create cheap drama.

Another sin was having most of the ""monsters"" just be humans that rarely flash a CGI monster face. It really just takes a lot of the fantasy out of it."
Live Up To Your Name,The wheel of time series.. F*ck Amazon and that show runner.
Live Up To Your Name,"Dexter. 

What a fucking GREAT premise. I feel like Dexter at its height didn’t come close to reaching its potential. Doing a recent rewatch and at its best it’s still B Tier television, and at its worst it’s just embarrassing. Showtime had a gold mine with this fucker and absolutely dropped the ball."
Live Up To Your Name,No one is going to say Lost?
Live Up To Your Name,Lost - I genuinely think it lost its way and had no real plan to get to the end point just kinda meandered it's way there through lots of annoying  turns
Live Up To Your Name,"Record of Ragnarok - the source material is great but you actually have to animate and have more than about 3 frames a second to have an animated show.


Game of Thrones - This is exactly why you shouldn’t make a show out of something that isn’t finished. Finish the goddamn books."

That show should be about blue laws the early days of lenny Bruce how difficult it was to be a woman in comedy cabaret licenses how comedy clubs really didn’t exist or are nothing like they are now how comedy was basically just line oners not routines not free form 

Nope.  It’s a lot of bad writing the same bad writing that the Gilmore girls were full of.  Same creator btw"
Live Up To Your Name,Lost
Live Up To Your Name,"Bob [hearts] Abishola - I think this is a very unique  and sweet sitcom that explores African culture and it is largely ruined by a laugh track. 

The laugh track feels like it dictates where the laughs should be and it makes it near unwatchable.

It should just be a dramedy or filmed the exact same way as Young Sheldon."
Live Up To Your Name,The Walking Dead. If only HBO had picked it up
Live Up To Your Name,How LOST isn't the top comment is beyond me.
Live Up To Your Name,"Honestly, any of the Shaggy Dog type of TV shows we get nowadays. The run times are super bloated and there is lots of meandering, or pointless sex thrown in to pad the run time, and every character is an asshole. The cynicism in modern TV is exhausting and I'm sick of the limited viewpoint that human nature is greedy, self-centered, and evil. Apparently it makes a show ""realistic!"" Like shit, Western creatives are still in the teenage edge phase. 

 Maybe I'm not searching for the right shows, but most of the popular Western shows are just pointless edge fests. It shocking and noteworthy, but there is no substance underneath or it all falls apart in the end. Atleast, in edgy stories like Berserk there are these human moments that shine through all the doom and gloom. Those moments leave lasting impressions!"
Live Up To Your Name,End of supernatural was horrible they really should have given the show a better ending that it got
Live Up To Your Name,"Designated Survivor. Season 1 introduced a new and unique premise; what if there was a catastrophic event and all of a sudden you found out that you were now the President of the United States? Season was entertaining TV with political intrigue, CIA spy thriller storylines, and interesting characters. Season 2 wasn't bad either, but couldn't quite live up to the hype of Season 1. Then there was Season 3. I will go to my grave arguing that Season 3 of Designated Survivor is the worst season of television in the history of television. They threw out some of the best characters without any explanation, every single storyline had to have some social justice component to it, the new characters weren't interesting, and the story went absolutely nowhere. It was awful. Such a cool premise that was absolutely ruined in epic fashion."

Live Up To Your Name,"Cowboy Bebop. The cartoon is phenomenal and could be a masterful tv series in the right hands. The Netflix show just didn't understand what made Bebop cool at all, they tried to make a shot-for-shot remake with all the goofiness intact. Anime as a medium is campy, and the campiness doesn't translate on screen; a tv adaptation of Bebop should have been less campy. Also casting John Cho was a misfire, he just doesn't have the look."
Live Up To Your Name,"My pick is easy, because it's so much worse than just bad TV, but something that crossed over from fiction to actively make the world a much worse place:

  
Kevin Can F Himself.

The premise would have been fine.  A roshomon ripoff with persepectives alternating between sitcom and ""reality"" persepectives.

They hired a popular actress and even ripped off her famous show's needlessly vulgar clickbait title schtick.  

It started with loads of promise.  They nailed the emulation of corny marriage sitcoms.  And the early episodes set up a perfect twist in which the *wife* is actually the abuser.  The world's bias against husbands/men in television would have been a great abstract antagonist, and a bold and fresh take.  

We see the wife as a brutally unreliable narrator, citing abuse where there's no real evidence of it.  There's hints galore that she's an addict and junkie: drugs, drinking, violence, crime, prostitution.  

The season could have lulled viewers into assuming ""Kevin"" is the abuser who deserves to die, then use the penultimate episode to snap to a *third* lens which shows the reality of how unreliable the narrator actually is, and how she's actually been the abuser all along.  The finale could have had any number of juicy denouements arising from that wicked twist.

But no.  Turns out it was just a vehicle for the rookie show creator's dangerous and depraved agenda, which she actually stated explicitly in the press, not just through the show.  It was to declare wives killing their boring husbands as ""female empowerment"". 

Seeing that horrid message played out in fiction was disappointing, sure.  But watching how many fans took it as documentary or concrete life advice was absolutely chilling.   Seeing fans view *anything* done by a male as automatically abusive was reductive and degrading to anyone who knows what *actual* abuse is.

Having the show creator confess that message was intentional was just sickening.

For going so far beyond the bounds of just being a crappy fictional television program, Kevin Can F Himself takes the prize."

And I’m not one to clutch my pearls over a TV show, but that series had some seriously unfortunate implications (the gay best friend turning out to be a psycho while his heteronormative dad was proven right to hate him, the jock rapist being unjustly accused and a super nice guy all along, etc)."

Save Me,Hey Lennie! Do you know the future of Morgan in the TWD Universe?
Save Me,Do you miss working on the walking dead?
Save Me,Hey Lennie? I hope you’ll visit Reddit more often. The Reddit community of Fear The Walking Dead is loving season 6 and a lot of people share their thoughts of season 6 and their favorite characters and stuff 🥰
Save Me,How long did it take you to master those moves with Morgan’s staff?
Save Me,Hi Lennie!
Save Me,Hi Lennie! Just wanted to say that I loved your characters in TWD and Line of Duty. Have there been any memorable moments from filming the new show? Excited to see your future projects!
Save Me,"I feel the Morgan/Rick storyline needs closure before TWD ends, do you agree?  They need one last scene on screen!"
Save Me,Hi Lennie! I'm curious to hear what you think of the new direction Morgan has taken in Fear The Walking Dead season 6 compared to where he was before. I'm really enjoying the new cowboy vibe. Hope we get to see some more lasso action!
Save Me,"Hi, Lennie! First of all, I’ve been a big fan since the Jericho days, now watching you in Fear The Walking Dead season 6. 

I know you directed Fear The Walking Dead’s second episode this season, ""Welcome to the Club"", what was the best part of directing an episode of the show? Would you like to do it again?"
Save Me,"Hey Lennie, I’ve always enjoyed your work.  Looking forward to more. 

What was the Blade Runner shoot like?  Love that flick btw."
Save Me,Which football club do you support and why?
Save Me,Hey Lennie. Is there any possibility of Taqa returning to FearTWD? I would love to see a scene with both of you.
Save Me,"Hello Lennie James,  
How was it to work with Frank Dillane and do you still keep contact with him?"
Save Me,"Hey Lennie, I just want to say I really appreciate your work. I loved you as Robert Hawkins in Jericho, as Sol in Snatch, and while I didn't always agree with the direction of TWD Morgan was always my favorite!"
Save Me,[deleted]
Save Me,"Of everything you have done, do you have a favorite scene or episode if you had to choose?"
Save Me,"Hey.

You first caught my eye in the film Outlaw which came out ages ago! How does it feel coming from films like that to more global recognition with shows like TWD?"
Save Me,Hey Lennie! Is there any hints you could give us for season 6?
Save Me,"Hey Lennie I am a big fan, I just wanted to ask how similar are you to Morgan in real life?"
Save Me,"Hi Lennie, I'm a big fan! Were you happy with how Jericho ended? I really loved that series but I felt like there was so much story left to tell when it ended."
Save Me,"Hi Lennie! I LOVE your characters on Save Me, Line of Duty and The Walking Dead, and I'm so happy that Fear the Walking Dead has had such an amazing improvement during the course of the first few episodes of Season 6. Really enjoyed the episode your directed, the opening minutes had a great horror feel to them!

My question to you is do you think you'll direct more television episodes in the the future, and if so what kind of genre interests you most?

Also, how much do you hate the nickname Momo? ;)"
Save Me,What do you miss most about being on TWD and are you sad you most likely won’t get to return to the main show before its conclusion?
Save Me,Why was Save Me and Save Me Too an important story to tell? Love Save Me SO much and I'm so happy to see a second season!!
Save Me,Which character was the most fun to write?
Save Me,"What different challenges do you face as an actor in a series you created? 

Why was the decision made for the second series to have multiple directors, whereas the first had one?"
Save Me,Which is harder killing zombies or hunting down a daughter?
Save Me,"How do you balance being the main character, but also the writer and creator?"
Save Me,I’m a huge fan! I wanted to know if you think your role in Walking Dead helped prepare you to play Nelly Rowe in any way?
Save Me,Hey Lennie! Is there any possibility of Madison returning to FearTWD? Would love to see a scene with you both.
Save Me,I don’t have a question. Just wanted to say that IM A MASSIVE FAN and I loved your performance in TWD and FEAR.
Save Me,"Hi Lennie! If you could descibe the show in three words, what would you say? Looking forward to the new show!"
Save Me,"Hey Lennie, i love your work mate, particular you and Robbie Gee as Sol and Vinny in Snatch, just amazing!

Have you been filming anything during the pandemic and if so how has it been?"
Save Me,Hi Lennie! What challenges do you face playing the role of Nelly?
Save Me,"Hi there, big fan!! Is there any aspect of your character, Nelly Rowe, that you really resonated with as you carried that character through SAVE ME TOO?"
Save Me,Hello Lennie! Is it true that you had to choose: get killed off in season 8 of TWD or go to FearTWD?
Save Me,What was your favorite scene to shoot?!
Save Me,What do you like better strawberries or kiwis?
Save Me,"Hi Lennie loved watching you over the years.  From Jericho, to Fear the walking Dead.  Wishing you many years of work.  You are a great actor."
Save Me,What's your favorite scene from TWD?
Save Me,"I don't have a question, I just wanted you to know how much I enjoyed your performances in Low Winter Sun and Line of Duty and look forward to seeing more of your work.

Take care."
Save Me,Hey Lennie. How far is FearTWD with filming season 6?
Save Me,What are your thoughts and do you feel like you get typecasted much?
Save Me,What is your favorite episode from save me?
Save Me,Hi Lennie! How did the name “Palm Tree” come about for the local meet up for everyone?
Save Me,You are an amazing actor
Save Me,What is your favorite kind of cheese?
Save Me,"""People talk about _______ like it's black and white."""
Save Me,Hey Lennie! Honestly you and Andrew changed my life. I stayed home sick from school one day and randomly came across the first episode of The Walking Dead. I was hooked from episode 1. The show was about at season 3 when I caught up and man.. I was always waiting for  when you and Andrew would be in a scene together. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such chemistry between actors before. And your acting with the Clear storyline is unreal. My question for you. Do you personally ever think that Mr Morgan Jones will run into Rick Grimes again one day? Again thank you Lennie. Your amazing!
Save Me,Hey Lennie. Do you ever think we’ll see Duane again and alive?
Save Me,"Mr. Leslie, my name is Anthony and I know this has little relevance to your show which I'm sure is fantastic, but if you can please tell Peacock to add and save the Syfy action-dramedy series Happy! for a 3rd season or a movie, a lot of fans like me would appreciate it.

This show means a lot to me and has generated a very big fanase. We're all devastated with how season 2 ended and we need to know what happens next. PS. The cast and crew (including Patton Oswalt) are up to do more!

Please respond, thank you, and #SaveHappy!"
Save Me,I love the show so much! Every episode has me on the edge of my seat. Where did the idea for Save Me come about?
Save Me,"Hi Lennie,

From TWD/FTWD set, who has been your favorite actor to work with?"
Save Me,"Hi Lennie! 
I really your work on TWD/ FTWD, Morgan is one my favourite characters and I think it is impressive to play such diverse of a character.
I also have one question: What was your favourite episode to film on TWD?"
Save Me,"Hey Lennie; I'm a massive fan of your works, and commend your variety; have you got any tips for somebody trying to break into the world of screenwriting? Thanks for your time!"
Save Me,I just want to say you are a fantastic actor and every time you play a character it blows me away. Great work sir.
Save Me,"Hey!

I'm just here to tell you how great the new FTWD season is. Really great Job!!!! All the best to you 🍀✨"
Save Me,Didn’t Duane die? I thought you said he had? Lol
Save Me,Jericho Walking dead crossover...what do you think Lennie!
Save Me,I love season 1 and look forward to watching season 2!
Save Me,Hey Lennie!Who is your favorite character of fear and why?
Save Me,Is he going to go Clear mode?
Save Me,"Hi Lennie, i just wanted to say that Morgan's my favourite character and that you are an amazing and a very talented actor. Thank you!"
Save Me,Can you go back to the main WD show for season 11 please we miss you there
Save Me,"Hey Lennie, just wanted to say, thank you for the great entertainment, season 6 of FTWD is so good, your job as a director and an actor is 10 outta 10. Keep it up, we love you."
Save Me,"Have just finished SM2 and I just came here to say Well Done on another well thought out and executed piece of drama.
Whats it like working with Stephen Graham and all the other cast? What are your highlights from filming and can you give us any info on S3 if any at all?
Stay safe x"
Save Me,"No, my friend...you know what it is!!!!!"
Save Me,"I love being Shaxx coz I have no idea what I'm talking about or what it's to do with! I'm not a gamer. If another gig like that came up, I'd love to do it. I've had a ball."
Save Me,"We love you Lennie! Goodluck on shooting season 6! We hope to see you on Reddit another time. (Maybe on the Fear The Walking Dead subreddit). We as fans talk about the show & characters everyday, would be amazing to have another Q&A with you or Alycia-Debnam Carey or any other actor from FearTWD 🥰😘"
Save Me,Yes and no!
Save Me,"Some days I do. I miss my friends. I miss Atlanta. That said, I'm really enjoying Austin and what we're doing over here on Fear."
Save Me,I may do that. I'm glad you're enjoying S6. I think the way we are telling the story this season is really working for us.
Save Me,I'm still working on them!
Save Me,Hi...
Save Me,There's a scene in Line oof Duty where my character stop a mugging on the street. We shot that on a real street in Birmingham with real people walking by. On one take a real member of the public jumped in to stop the 'mugging' before I could get there. I think she even hit the actor!
Save Me,"I agree with anything that means I will be back in the company of my mate Andy! So yes, if closure does it, then lets have closure!"
Save Me,"Obviously I'm a little further along the road than you guys are, but I'm enjoying the challenge of where Morgan finds himself at the moment. Feel like I've got the hat to fit just right and I'm enjoying my time in the saddle."
Save Me,"I will do it again. Don't know when.  
I loved working with my DOP Adam Suschitzky. Really enjoyed working out how we wanted the scenes to be shot and what we wanted to get from them. I loved learning from him and realizing how much I knew and how much I didn't!"
Save Me,BR was a blast. Loved working with Denis and Ryan. It felt like a big movie when we were shooting it and I felt so chuffed to be a small part of it.
Save Me,I am a proud Tottenham Hotspur season ticket holder and will be till the day I die. I support Spurs because my brothers-in-law do and when I was dating my wife it was the only way they would let me get anywhere near her!
Save Me,I would love that too.
Save Me,"I loved working with Frank and wish we could've done more of it. He is one of the bravest actors I've ever worked with. We haven't been in the same place at the same time in a while, but I really look forward to the next time we are."
Save Me,Many thanks for watching.
Save Me,"On TWD/FTWD it would probably be Michonne or Eugene. On Save Me, probably Stace - I quite fancy myself as a bit of a mixologist!"
Save Me,I've been lucky and have had many great days and experiences doing what I do. One that comes to mind was the first time I got to ride a horse properly on a US TV show. It was on Jericho and I had to gallop across ranch land. They gave me a horse who really knew what he was doing and made me look like I could ride. It felt like I was flying when we got up to speed and I was giddy as a kid! Loved it. Felt like a cowboy!
Save Me,"The whole WD experience has been a trip. I try and take it all in my stride and keep perspective on it all. I was a working actor before TWD universe came knocking, I hope to be one again when we finish the Walker experience."
Save Me,I can't really. All I can say is this season is dark and unexpected.
Save Me,"I'm not nearly as brave as him and I smile more! 

We're about the same height though;)"
Save Me,"I made friends for life on Jericho, I really did. It was my first audition in the US and my first show. I wasn't happy with the way it ended. CBS got that one wrong - twice!"
Save Me,"If I say I hate Momo, the show runners will just use it more and more! So I love Momo! Who wouldn't??!!

I really enjoyed directing Ep2. I hope to do it again. Don't know when, yet. Don't know where. Don't know what."
Save Me,I was very sad to leave the show. I miss my friends on the show and the friends I made in Atlanta.
Save Me,Save Me and Save Me Too was an important story for me because it was the one I wanted to tell. I wanted to write a thriller populated by characters who don't normally populate the center of a thriller and I wanted to set it in an area of London almost never where thrillers are set. And I wanted to make the yellow puffer jacket iconic!!!!!
Save Me,"I found something I loved in writing all of the characters, I really did. It was easier to write them second time around, I remember that - because so many of the characters returned and I knew them better and they felt more real because of the fantastic actors who brought them to life."
Save Me,"The major challenge being an actor on a show you've created is making sure you're not doing both things at the same time. I had to protect my time as the actor playing Nelly. So we had a rule, all script question on filming days went to the director not me.

We had two directors second time around to save time mostly. Sky wanted a finished series as soon as they could have one."
Save Me,Hunting down Jody. Definitely. Walkers move slower!
Save Me,I rely on others and cherish sleep!
Save Me,"That's a good question. I don't really know. If it did, I wasn't really aware of it."
Save Me,"I would love to be in a scene with Kim. Anywhere. In anything. As I said to someone else about Duane, I don't know the answer, but anything is possible in this WD universe!"
Messy Goes to Okido,[Rickles then comes back for revenge later in a Romeo and Juliet sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMLRwqPm_gk)
Messy Goes to Okido,Don Rickles on late night shows are some of the best improvised moments of comedy. His segments with Carson and Letterman were all amazing. It was a joy to see two of the best in Carson and Letterman let Rickles just go off.
Messy Goes to Okido,"Don Rickles was truly one of a kind, RIP."
Messy Goes to Okido,"From this point on in the episode Rickles just gleefully breaks the fourth wall whenever he wants, especially if Piscopo is there and he can start going after him again. Pure, wonderful chaos, honestly one of my favorite SNL episodes to watch in full because of it."
Messy Goes to Okido,"It is a rare day that I say something nice about Jim Belushi, but he does a great job of keeping it together here."
Messy Goes to Okido,[deleted]
Messy Goes to Okido,HAHA that is incredible!
Messy Goes to Okido,"Holy shit that was awesome.

""No notes."""
Messy Goes to Okido,"Holy shit I’ve never seen this before, thanks for posting this. What a treat to see some new-to-me Rickles."
Messy Goes to Okido,"I'm really curious to see the rehearsal version, because I feel like this rivalry might have been building up there and spilled over into the live recording."
Messy Goes to Okido,"I still rewatch Rickles' appearances at Letterman, man got some insanely fast comedy brains and he was like, 80"
Messy Goes to Okido,Yeah i knoww what slapstick is
Messy Goes to Okido,Did they dislike each other?
Messy Goes to Okido,"Isn't it amazing how when competent actors break character they IMPROVE the scene instead of completely ruining it by laughing and destroying the continuity?

When people say SNL has declined in quality you just need to watch this clip vs a modern clip of a 'breakdown' skit.  It is light years different when comedians can't enhance a scene with their own input like we've been forced to sit through for the last decade."
Messy Goes to Okido,That was a weak cast. Bargain basement Belushi and Joe Piscopo.
Messy Goes to Okido,Rickkes wasn't funny at all.
Messy Goes to Okido,"Was Rickles genuinely angry or was he having fun with Piscopo? I’m honestly having trouble telling. Some moments it seems like he’s having fun, and others it seems like he’s actually pissed but trying to hide it."
Messy Goes to Okido,Elaine!
Messy Goes to Okido,“I hope Eddie Murphy robs your house!”
Messy Goes to Okido,"Totally agree. His late night appearances were unhinged. Not for nothing, watching Rickles roast Max Weinberg on Conan in the mid 90's was pretty sweet, too."
Messy Goes to Okido,Saw an episode of *Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In* with him as guest - just a hilarious guy
Messy Goes to Okido,"Yeah, the chaos surrounding him kind of makes him committing to the oblivious cop role really work."
Messy Goes to Okido,"On Conan's podcast it was said that Jim Belushi would take a shit in the fake bathroom set every day and force one of the crew to clean it up. This was on his show ""Life According to Jim""."
Messy Goes to Okido,This was during the period where Dick Ebersol from NBC Sports was running SNL. Lorne Michaels came back for the 1985 season.
Messy Goes to Okido,"On the other hand, aside from this and maybe one other sketch, everyone's forgotten the rest of this episode.  SNL has always been more misses than hits, but it keeps going because when it hits, it hits big."
Messy Goes to Okido,"""forced to sit through"" 

I don't know about you, but I just... Don't watch it."
Messy Goes to Okido,Nah. It's got nothing to do with SNL quality. Don Rickles is just the best
Messy Goes to Okido,"You’re cherry picking a sketch from decades ago that someone liked with all of modern SNL. 

It’s always been mostly misses with a few hits each season. That’s just SNL"
Messy Goes to Okido,(Jimmy Fallon awakens from his slumber)
Messy Goes to Okido,">Rickkes wasn't funny at all.

Maybe not but Rickles certainly was."
Messy Goes to Okido,"They're having a blast for sure, both of them"
Messy Goes to Okido,What's the context of the joke? Did he and Eddie Murphy not like each other?
Messy Goes to Okido,Someone actually has to keep the sketch going.
Messy Goes to Okido,That's fucked up.
Messy Goes to Okido,"It's not like I tied people up and made 'em watch it.  And I could've, cause I'm a big guy and I'm good with knots!"
Messy Goes to Okido,jimmy fallon hasn't been an SNL cast member in *20 years*
Messy Goes to Okido,"Piscopo and Murphy were actually very close during their SNL years.

I might be wrong but I do believe they were seen as a bit of a duo."
Messy Goes to Okido,Rickles did a lot of comedy based on stereotypes so it’s probably because Eddie is black
Messy Goes to Okido,I would assume it's in reference to Mr Robinson's Neighborhood
Messy Goes to Okido,Their most famous was [Ebony and Ivory - Frank and Stevie](https://youtu.be/0h2jZtuRuic)
Messy Goes to Okido,"That explains the joke in Eddie's monologue back in 2019. Beck Bennett interrupts the monologue and gets ushered off stage by Keenan Thompson. Eddie asks ""who was that?"" and Tracy Morgan says ""Joe Piscopo""."
Messy Goes to Okido,Because he was an unfunny hack.
Messy Goes to Okido,Oof lmao take a hike on this one
Messy Goes to Okido,"Just started watching this and absolutely LOVED it, it’s definitely not a typical superhero show"
Messy Goes to Okido,"In case anyone is wondering, the song is “Something for Your Mind” by Superorganism, and yes that is the actual band appearing in the show."
Messy Goes to Okido,It's incredible how fast this series exited the collective mind. Nobody seems to talk about it.
Messy Goes to Okido,I wish some of the characters from Legion would pop up in Loki.  The production design for the TVA seems heavily inspired by Legion.
Messy Goes to Okido,I found Switch exceptionally attractive.  Shame her role basically disappeared after the first couple of episodes of that season.
Messy Goes to Okido,I wish the whole season had been a bit more inspired like this.
Messy Goes to Okido,Well that was odd
Messy Goes to Okido,Love this show and how absolutely trippy and fucked up it was willing to get to tell its story.
Messy Goes to Okido,I really like this scence and a lot of the first half of season 3. I think the second of the season really drags
Messy Goes to Okido,Best Marvel television show.
Messy Goes to Okido,I watched it years ago with the closed captioning on and thought the word `SUPERORGANISM` was explaining the nature Legion’s relationship with his followers.
Messy Goes to Okido,It appeared on Fifa soundtrack the same year this season came out so when they played it on the show I literally did the Leo DiCaprio pointing at the tv meme ha
Messy Goes to Okido,"Their first album was my most listened to of 2018, I even went and saw them live. (One of the weirdest concerts I’ve ever seen btw) Try as I might though, I just really couldn’t get into their new album World Wide Pop."
Messy Goes to Okido,"WOW I didn’t realise it was also the actual band, damn"
Messy Goes to Okido,Thought it was them
Messy Goes to Okido,"My family talks about it all the time. The third season especially clicked really well with us. I've never read marvel comics, so I was completely blown away by >!David being the son of Charles Xavier!<. I think that there's just so much media that when a show ends, the people who watched it will talk about it, but it doesn't leave certain circles. Like Atlanta, another FX show. Very satisfying ending, to me. Great series. But I haven't seen anyone mention it online since it ended."
Messy Goes to Okido,Is it still good?
Messy Goes to Okido,"If nothing else, everybody knows MCU's X-Men is coming eventually. There's zero reason they couldn't involve some of the cast into the films/tv shows that follow."
Messy Goes to Okido,There was a 3d season?
Messy Goes to Okido,Needs a full series Blue Ray release.
Messy Goes to Okido,It is an absolute masterpiece of anachronisms. I loved it.
Messy Goes to Okido,Yeah. But it does end up having more style than substance.
Messy Goes to Okido,"A shorter answer than you're getting is that, yes it's worth watching. Super weird, very memorable, extremely creative."
Messy Goes to Okido,"Dan Stevens is wonderful in everything.  Would love to see him in the MCU, even if he doesn't play David."
Messy Goes to Okido,Maybe the most style over substance show I’ve ever seen - especially how it resolved - but I really enjoyed it.
Messy Goes to Okido,And every now and then we hear Syd saying: *David*
Messy Goes to Okido,I'd just like to see him more often in general
Messy Goes to Okido,Yup.
Messy Goes to Okido,"I watched him in a German film, I’m your Man, and he is just as good in another language!"
Messy Goes to Okido,"Invincible on Amazon. comic series is amazing, 1st EP is good, just typical superhero stuff. then, the last 5 minutes happen."
Messy Goes to Okido,The Shield
Messy Goes to Okido,"The last scene in GOT first episode certainly hooked a whole ton of people. The rest of the episode isn't meh though, but the end sticks out huge"
Messy Goes to Okido,"It’s not amazing by any stretch, but when Modern Family was screened for critics they were not allowed to give away the last five minute “twist”- that all three families were related."
Messy Goes to Okido,"Mad Men has a great pilot, but the ending twist where you find out Don is a family man and not just some tomcat was amazing. I knew about the show and the characters before I watched it but it struck me how interesting it was for the pilot to wait until the very end to reveal he had a wife and kids. And obviously that plays into the whole theme of the show, feeling like you know who these characters are and then having a bombshell dropped on you when they reveal their true selves."
Messy Goes to Okido,The Expanse. “There’s something you should know…”
Messy Goes to Okido,"*This is Us*

Regardless of your thoughts on the show that is an all-time pilot."
Messy Goes to Okido,"I had this feeling the first time I watched Dexter. Mind you, it did have a wild opening too - shows Dexter doing his serial killin’ - but then it slides into a more typical police procedural and I figured it would be the usual episode of the week case. Something happens at the very end of the first episode to indicate that this will not be that kind of show!

I cannot vouch for the quality of the later seasons, but those first few are some of the most exciting TV I’ve seen (and it is especially fun to watch with a first time viewer after you’ve seen it because there are a lot of great twists and turns)!


I guess Lost is also possibly a contender for this, although I think the premiere is excellent from start to finish. But the last scene where the pilot mentions that they were off course the whole time recontextualizes the show premise, that it isn’t just gonna be some gilligan’s island fare."
Messy Goes to Okido,"Jessica Jones. Holy shit. It had been a pretty standard - if a little edgelordy - vaguely-supery detective drama and functioned perfectly well. Something on par with Dark Angel or whatever.

That last five minutes sends it into another league altogether, it's a far meaner beast than its been letting on.

Shame about the later seasons, but S1 is something special. I don’t think Netflix has much to match it since, and Disney-Marvel has nothing."
Messy Goes to Okido,Recently watched The Mayor of Kingstown and the ending of the first episode definitely got me hooked. Kind of suprised more people aren't talking about it.
Messy Goes to Okido,I remember being kind of meh on Fargo during the pilot until a certain scene happens with Martin Freeman’s character that caught me by surprise and reset the tone of the season into the ama iron show it is
Messy Goes to Okido,"How to get away with murder

Fast forwards into the future and leaves you wondering how it will all unfold"
Messy Goes to Okido,Dead to Me got me in the last five minutes. Up til then I was literally thinking I wasn’t going to keep watching.
Messy Goes to Okido,"It doesn't fit because the whole pilot was very good, but Lost 2-night Premiere last 5 minutes still ratcheted up the intrigue to 11. 

[Guys - where are we?](https://youtu.be/iOgWhTr1RC0)"
Messy Goes to Okido,"The Americans. That sequence where 'Tusk,' by Fleetwood Mac kicks in is just **chef's kiss** pure perfection."
Messy Goes to Okido,"Not the last five minutes, but the ""Paint It Black"" sequence in the Westworld pilot hooked me"
Messy Goes to Okido,"True Detective S1. Mind you, the entire episode is incredible. But the delivery of the final line “well why don’t you start asking the right fuckin’ questions?” is *chef’s kiss*"
Messy Goes to Okido,"“How I Met Your Mother.”  Much of the pilot is a genial Friends clone, then the last five minutes turned things on its head and got me hooked at least for the next episode if not the season."
Messy Goes to Okido,"""Lost, and ""The Good Place"""
Messy Goes to Okido,The Magicians. The first episode has a bit of a crazy ending.
Messy Goes to Okido,Prison Break
Messy Goes to Okido,"Black Sails. While, in my opinion, the show truly crosses the line into ""one of the greats"" territory in the finale of the first season, still the ending of the first episode really makes you go: ""oh, theres more to this than just a decent pirate show"""
Messy Goes to Okido,The Shield.
Messy Goes to Okido,"Poker Face is like this. The pilot is good, engaging, but the last five, maybe ten minutes really made me need to watch the next episode."
Messy Goes to Okido,The Boys
Messy Goes to Okido,I just watched the first episode of Doctor Who on HBO Max. Was pretty bored up until the madness happened at the end.
Messy Goes to Okido,"For me, it was a show no one’s ever heard of called Good Behavior, starring Michelle Dockery and Juan Diego Botto. I think both seasons are still on Hulu and HBO Max. Such a brilliant, fun pilot, but the last five minutes really hook you and set up the entire series."
Messy Goes to Okido,"Years and years. The episode shows a big and diverse family, just like many tv shows. But the ending shows you how really will be the next episodes."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,This show opened huge
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"NOTE: There're spoilers in the second half of the article, after a spoiler alert."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Where can I watch it in the U.S.?
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I love traditional dramas so I'm not surprised. They are always full of scheming and I live that!
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"They’re both expensive and have already been done.

All the money is going into adaptions of modern fantasy works at the moment."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,netflix has an animated show called Blood of Zeus and a live action Norwegian show Ragnarok
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Forget that, we need a game of thrones style series of the old testament. (Not the boring old Pentateuch part that's been done to death)

Judges-kings are metal as fuq. It's got sex, politics, diplomacy, violence, palace intrigue, etc. Crazy men of God doing all kinds of stuff. (Not to mention the beautiful poetic speeches that can be sprinkled in)

And not just the famous parts, like David as a murderous mafia don. But like, kings 2 ch 9. particularly vs 30-37."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,You should watch The Almighty Johnson’s. New Zealand show about Norse gods.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Sandman.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"I think a lot of it is people just don't have much to add. 

Like we still see some things, such as the upcoming God of War series, but I really don't think it's more complicated than that."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Percy Jackson just finished filming… Hope it’s good
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Got to agree - I can't believe they haven't delved into Greek mythology with the same energy they've put into comic books and other things. There is \*so\* much to explore and develop in those stories and characters.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"You looking for any shows about mythology/folklore, or specifically Greek Epic style mythology?

Can't help much with the latter, feel like stuff like Supernatural and Once took their place

But there's a lot of shows that incorporate folklore & myth into their premise

I'd recommend the first season of The Terror, could check out The Outsider, American Gods, Channel Zero uses copy-pastas as ""modern folklore"" etc

But idk of anything that captures the pulpy vibe of Xena and Hercules"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Not even just mythology, but historical 'swords and sandles' in general. Rome was fantastic but by now its legacy is more that it walked so shows like Games of Thrones could run.

I've been dying for a show that does the Punic Wars justice, particularly second and third as I imagine the first being largely a naval would be virtually impossible, even compared with how difficult it'd be to film some of the battles/crossing of the alps/destruction of Carthage etc. For years Vin Diesel wanted to do it as a film and play Hannibal though I struggle to imagine a reality where that would've been good.

Who knows, now that superhero fatigue is starting to take hold, we might go back to getting some of the classic mythological or historical content like the last flurry we had around the late 90s and early 2000s."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,O brother where art thou is the odyssey
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I’ve read that these shows are expensive as hell to make so maybe that’s part of the reason for their absence.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Right now there are 3-4+ mythology books coming out a year.  It's surprising none of them have been picked up for a movie or mini series. Song of Achilles and Circie from Madeline Miller are both huge in book circles and Jennifer Saint's new book Atalanta has early buzz coming off her last two books Ariadne and Elektra. These books span decades and give different view points on Mythology and most overlap the Trojan war but center themselves on the often forgotten women. I would love to see a show based on any of these! It feels like at least in the book world mythology is having a Renaissance or moment and I hope the Percy Jackson show is good and pushes the genre back to TV. Sorry if I sound optimistic but i can't help it.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"properties which are still under copyright protection will have agents repping them to producers, pitching them in various ways. people are actively getting to get rich off of them. 

zeus doesn't have an agent."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"There are fantastic books on the idea but for somw odd reason, Hollywood will not make new movies based on any books in theblast 10 years"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"When I was in English literature class, I sort of understood us taking a look at Roman and Greek mythology, but I never understood how much of Beowolf we had to cover."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Period pieces tend to be expensive. But at the same time, those old myths should have storytelling power that a good writer could do in the modern age.

But at least for Greek myths, we're about to get Percy Jackson, and he might get some imitators."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"It’s always annoyed me that these sorts of shows died off. The BBC had a string of them from around 2006-2015 that they used to try to replicate Doctor Who’s success. 

The Robin Hood show was a pretty great fun adventure show. Nothing too serious but a great fun watch. Merlin was also good early on and was becoming great by the time it very suddenly ended. Atlantis started off as a crap imitation of early Merlin in its first season, but the second was great. Would have loved to see it get to tackle more of the Greek mythology but it was too expensive for the BBC.

Sky tried a Sinbad show around a decade ago but it was pretty crap and got canned after one season."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Watch Norsemen for accurate portrayal of the  past
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"For so long the mythological stories have been done so poorly or have just retread the same shit over and over again. 

>  I remember growing up there was Hercules Xena: Warrior princess 

Perfect example as both of them were just shit.

It is hard to get people excited about it.  That is one of the really wild things about the last two God Of War games. They show Odin and Thor in completely different lights."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Gods of Egypt(2016) flopped and I remember at the time feeling like it had become a creatively bankrupt topic. I thought ""ok we've all seen this plenty before, it loses its charm since you have nothing new to do with it."""
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,You might like Britannia.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,God of War is early in being made into a series.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Clash of the Titans, it's remake and sequel, and The Immortals are the only ones of that ilk that come to mind."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"There is a modern retelling of Odysseus coming. It is a musical (sort of like Hamilton).

It's called ""Epic"" 

But that is live theatre."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,You mean like Thor?
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Problem is anything outside of western myth that was discarded with the onset of the less fun religions like Christianity has already been done to death, except eastern european, where they tried with the witcher show but failed to make anything not garbage.

Anything not western ties directly into modern religion in many cases and so would get that 'cultural appropriation' label slapped on it."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,They are expensive and will look ridiculous today anyway. In fact sometimes someone tries and they got cancelled pretty soon.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"They're just too boring.  These are stories we had to read in school, and we've seen adapted over decades, and there gets to a point where there is just not going to be anything more interesting to say about them. 

I'd much rather see us creating our own new mythologies, like Star Wars and The Last of Us and I guess Harry Potter, though I'm not a fan.  Just new stories though, give us that.  (Even if you subscribe to the idea of the monomyth, there are still original ways to tell the same story, but rehashing Greek/Roman versions isn't the way.)"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"I think these kind of stories got a little overplayed. Pretty much up into the 2000s, we had a ton of mythology based movies/shows. I think people got bored with them. Also, I believe society shifted from being intrigued by the past and revering ancient wisdom, to looking towards the future."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,[removed]
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"because people want to be engaged and surprised.  those heroes are old and boring.  when we DO see an attempt to re-glorify similar heroes, it doesn't pay.  


now, maybe i'm wrong, and a studio will test the waters and adapt the right story the right way with the right actors and the right blend of action/comedy/drama/romance...  


but probably it's not worth the investment.  movies cost a lot of money to make.  


unless you're making Skinamarink - then you can just leave a camera on the floor overnight and sucker a bunch of idiots at film festivals into thinking you made a movie."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Their characters are just horribly outdated though. Xena would not fly today, Hercules even less.
And Sinbad would be a huge field of racism landmines..."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Are we not sick of super hero powers yet ? And Disney has a lot super hero just not Greek inspired ones.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"seems like ppl today dont know anything that hapd more than 5 yrs ago

they think its a fairy tale when ppl say there was a time you could work and actually afford to live"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"It's gonna take either some more time until they run out of ideas and turn to remakes, or some surprise show makes everyone scramble. It will happen one way or the other, just not now, as everyone is still trying to get onto the fantasy train."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,American Gods
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I'm *very* excited for the God of War series even though they're starting with Norse mythology and Amazon has a bad track record with attractions.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I was actually thinking about how cool a Hercules show would be that focuses on his 12 labours.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"I'd love to see modern adaptations of all the abrahamic mythologies. Has there been any movies and shows about that type of fiction? 

Greek/ Egyptian / Norse mythologies have already been done."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Aren’t not isn’t
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"I think you should give American Gods a try. I never did read the book, but the show was interesting and really did a interesting job of weaving different gods together. It only lasted 2 seasons on Starz, but it was pretty I thought."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"The key would be to create original characters for copyright reasons and use existing mythology as a background.

It could definitely work and there is a treasure of material to chose from."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,An Epic of Gilgamesh movie done well would be amazing
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,John Carter!
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"I did have this idea a while back for a unique way to adapt The Iliad and The Odyssey; miniseries, yes, but animated musical miniseries with a vibe comparable to some of the heavier Disney movies. I just remember really loving The Odyssey when I read it in school and thinking it would be really cool as some kind of musical but it's too long for a movie so miniseries it is. Only problem is what age-range to voice-cast Odysseus"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,[deleted]
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,People are remaking shows that aren't even 10 years old they can definitely remake those since most of those movies are really really old and are either hard to find online or aren't interesting to many people. It's a popular genre that they just don't seem to exploit but rather continue doing the same thing or focus on murderers.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"> and have already been done.

That's not something that stopped Hollywood before, half of what they do has already been done lol or are derivative of it. 

Old mythology stories have been way less done than that (and most have never been done actually)"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Ragnarok is so so good. Season 3 coming out this year
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I watched Blood of Zeus and found it pretty average
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"> a live action Norwegian show Ragnarok

I'm still angry netflix canceled Norsemen which was so funny."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I want to see Revelations: the Animated Series. Shows like Supernatural always side-step doing Revelations straight and that's partly because it's too gonzo for them. I want to watch Kaiju Jesus fight the Beast of the Apocalypse and Dragon Satan.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"They tried to do that over a decade ago, but it was on NBC so it really didn't have chance though."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Good way to offend everyone and get mail bombs from some christian nut
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Raised By Wolves was the Book of Enoch if that floats your boat.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,That was exactly the show I thought of when I read the post!
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,[deleted]
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,What if I made a show about *all* the mythology?
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"The next seasons definitely have a lot of characters from mythology, especially Greek and Norse, popping up. Some even play an important role. They already showed a clue of this when Calliope, a Muse, mentioned to Morpheus that they should talk about their son."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Could do some mythologies that are less well-known in the West.

I think the Epic of Mwindo could make a good animated mini-series:

https://youtu.be/NzmFEDNWTO8

And the Legend of Johnny Snake-Shoulders could be an entertaining movie:

https://youtu.be/4n7Iub1HkNg"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,There is not much to add honnestly. Just plain old the adventures of X character with a modern touch would honestly be awesome
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"While I'm excited for that show, it's not exactly an old classical story. What I'm talking here is stuff like the Arabian nights or the Odyssey."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Unfortunately it (obviously) not be adult-oriented or touch on the more fucked up parts of mythology.

Nothing wrong with that, but it's not the mythology adaptation I think OP was aiming for."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"and a pretty damn good retelling, at that!!  Plus the soundtrack is amazing!"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I am so anxious for a Circe or SOA adaptation !!!! both those books are incredible and could translate very well to series
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Well, look at it this way... Beowulf is actual English literature whereas Roman and Greek mythology isn't.

(Obviously there's lots of classical adaptations in English, e.g. Gods Behaving Badly, and who knows how many English language retellings/translations but you get the point I'm making, right?)"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Yeah, the harsh truth about archery and very cold fingers !"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,They weren’t shit at all.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Honestly for the time and the budget both of those were actually pretty good shows.  Xena was definitely the better of the 2 and holds up a lot better, but both were entertaining filler television in  an age where most TV would just bore the hell out of you."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"For a TV show back then, it was legit. You gotta remember that TV show back then weren't exactly taken seriously and had much smaller budget. A TV show about Hercules or Sinbad today would have a much higher quality (probably)"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Xena is a great show.

Funny, but with some excellent emotional moments as well."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Gods of Egypt was not remotely mythologically accurate. Off the top of my head, a cool original movie could be some freshly dead guy having to deal how utterly insane the Egyptian mythological afterlife was. Specifically, someone poor who couldn't pay to skip all the hardships and tests."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Egyptian myth didn't get anything decent in any visual medium. Closest was the ""gods of egypt"" movie which was... not good and didn't do much with actual myhology."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"> Also, I believe society shifted from being intrigued by the past and revering ancient wisdom, to looking towards the future.

Ancient-based fantasy fiction is holding society back, that's a new one, I suppose you also blame medieval-era stuff if not The Handmaid's Tale for our abortion rights chaos? If what you're saying is true (not just society looking towards the future but the correlation) why aren't there more optimistic sci-fi shows like Eureka or The Orville"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I somehow missed the memo where mythological gods and heroes counted as superheroes in the sense of contributing to the oversaturation
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Those movies actually sell. ~10 years ago studios tried to push mythology movies and it didn't work.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,Superheroes are arguably the modern equivalent of gods.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,">.. or Batman 26.

Miley Cyrus was robbed of an Oscar for Batman25."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"As a bonus, most of those stories are public domain - no rights issues to use those characters.

Or at least it should be a bonus.  I think one of the reasons we don't see more of them currently is that studios can't lock down the rights to those characters.  Anyone can technically make a Loki series, or Thor.  Likewise for Hercules, Sherlock Holmes, and I think now even Tarzan.  This may make them afraid that someone will snag their characters and they can't do anything about it."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,You can't have Hercules drinking a Coke^(TM) or driving a Ford Mustang^(TM) Though!
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,If that’s true then why is OP complaining?
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"It's decent, but the CGI effects are terrible and as a Norwegian I can tell you that the acting is pretty bad, too. But it's like a guilty pleasure to watch for a lot of us."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"So shows like what you ask about exist, you just don't care for them.."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,And Ragnarok is pretty slow.
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Also angel designs that make you go insane when you look at them, as depicted in that religiously-accurate game, Bayonetta."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Here's my take:

Season 1: Samuel-Saul-Rise of David

Season 2: David's reign (including succession wars and Bathsheba)

Season 2.5 interlude: reign of Solomon


Season 3:  Monarchy 
The 2 kingdoms intrigue- Elijah/elisha

Season 4: the fall part 1: Amos/Isaiah/Hosea and the fall of the northern kingdom

Season 5: the fall part 2: Jeremiah/Ezekiel and the fall of Judah/destruction of the temple


Sequel: exile and reconstruction:
Daniel, Esther, Ezra/Nehemiah (wars, intrigue, sex (Esther, Susanna, etc)

Anthological Prequel: Judges - 3 seasons: season 1 until Samson, season 2 Samson, season 3 tribulations: Jephthah, the Levites concubine/civil war, Micah and the ephod"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,It was so good but it didn't even get a full season order 😢
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Kings? Idk Kings was pretty sloppy. I'm watching it on dvd at the moment as I found a used copy and hadn't kept up with the show after it was moved to Saturdays. I'm not overly familiar with the Bible so I don't know how different the show is but it feels to me like Kings just sort of wants to be The West Wing, but it's the Bible. Lot of side characters without much to do too. But most importantly, according to the commentary, NBC was super supportive of the show creatively but didn't want to advertise the religion aspects for fear of turning both non religious people and overly evangelical people off, and I feel like a modern show would have a similar marketing problem. On the one side you're gonna get ""eew, a Bible show"" and on the other you're gonna get ""David never said that, this is sacrelige!"""
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I'm pissed they cancelled it
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Totally fair distinction. I also think bad movies, say, the Rock’s Hercules make it harder to think of ancient mythologies as ripe for the picking."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"It's also intended for a younger crowd and as a result, it's just not quite as good as it could be (well, the movies weren't anyway)."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,I agreed with OP in my other comment I just thought the title saying “modern series around old popular mythology” felt relevant  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Sounds legit, I give you a B+"
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Yeah uh-huh.. 

My kid was alive when Xena and Hercules started and both shows were shit. Both were more of the 3rd rate crap that showed on the USA network."
Yanxi Palace: Princess Adventures,"Xena still holds up because the show didn't take it self seriously.

If Xena had been shot in widescreen, I could have seen it have been a moderate succes on streaming today, there are a lot of older shows that are hold back by either the aspect ratio, or a bad widescreen conversion."
The Neighbor,SO.MANY superhero shows....
The Neighbor,The first season flew underneath the radar for so many.  I actually watch the first season last year and did like it. It was funny.
The Neighbor,I've never even heard about this one and it's apparently 2 seasons in
The Neighbor,When every show is super.... no one is!
The Neighbor,Please eliminate three.  I am not a crackpot.
The Neighbor,Yup. Too much capeshit
The Neighbor,"Season 1 was a bit of a drag but it had some great moments, the ending scene was really great with a bit of a twist on the intro for the show. I'm surprised and happy this got a second season."
The Neighbor,And the trailer looks like it'd be for a season 1 origin story...
The Neighbor,Much better than Matter of None season 3.
The Neighbor,"Thanks for posting. I loved Super, so I'll def check this out."
The Neighbor,The ending is definitely an interesting twist based off the original premise
The Neighbor,"It's like Tommy Wiseau was transported to Earth, given five minutes to learn human behaviour and told to write a script with humans in it."
The Neighbor,"For anyone who has yet to experience it, [here is episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxp83CimT0w&feature=player_embedded) of the short lived... *thing* that Tommy Wiseau did for Machinima a few years ago.    

I'm still not entirely convinced that Wiseau isn't just a character invented by a bored artist."
The Neighbor,"I read Greg Sestero's book The Disaster Artist on Tommy and the filming of the Room.  It was hilarious (as Tommy always is) but once you get about 100 pages in you get the idea that something is deeply, deeply wrong with Tommy; that he so badly wants to be socially accepted and loved and he has no idea of how to pull it off.  He's almost like a real life Willy Loman from Death of a Salesman, just with unexplicable unlimited wealth."
The Neighbor,I hope everyone KEEPS THEIR STUPID COMMENTS IN THEIR POCKET 
The Neighbor,He's like that singer that goes on American Idol and doesn't know they are tone deaf.
The Neighbor,If you've never seen The Room watch [this short scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S9Ew3TIeVQ). Ive watched it so many times and I still laugh. It's just so crazy. [Bonus amazing tuxedo football scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjgPYaCr6so). ^^^cheepcheepcheep
The Neighbor,We're fortunate to live in such a beautiful world.
The Neighbor,"Oh hai. This is the best news I've read in a long time. What's great is that even though he's totally aware and in on the joke now, he still sucks at what he does. I love him.  "
The Neighbor,Thank god it's from 10 years ago. I dunno what Tommy looks like now but I'm afraid to google it. Probably looks like he's half way through some Arc of the Covenant style face melting!
The Neighbor,"""I did not hit her, it's not true! It's bullshit! I did not hit her! I did not!"""
The Neighbor,I hope doggie is in it. He's my favorite character.
The Neighbor,"It's all porn without porn. Bad acting, bad costumes, everyone kind of seems high, long pauses, awkward timing. Just waiting for the pizza guy to show up.

In other words, it is brilliant."
The Neighbor,"Ah, those 15 minute-long lovemaking scenes, with bedsheets, roses, and plenty of ""aww""ing and chuckling."
The Neighbor,"Can I just say (even though most people probably know) there's a soundboard for ""The Room""?

http://theroomsoundboard.com/"
The Neighbor,I just watched The Room for my first time 3 days ago. So my wait time in between Wiseau projects is gonna be so brief. I am the luckiest man alive!!
The Neighbor,[deleted]
The Neighbor,"I just watched the trailer, and *everyone* is overacting.  Everyone."
The Neighbor,"It's not from 10 years ago, the original pilot was filmed back then but this is a second attempt. A friend of mine is working with him on the project and they're now trying to get the show picked up. "
The Neighbor,"Oh... Oh Tommy, you *shouldn't* have. You know how to treat your fans right.

This is possibly the best news I've gotten all year."
The Neighbor,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5rc6fHhm7I

Great interview of Greg Sestero, who played Tommy's friend in The Room.  Hearing about Tommy from him is absolutely nuts, and he's even written a book about it (that may become a movie).  "
The Neighbor,[Batman played by Tommy Wiseau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhCbj0LyHpg)
The Neighbor,"For a moment, I though he did [The Lost Room](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830361/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and got all excited :/"
The Neighbor,The best work Tommy Wiseau has been appart of - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tng4OluHqsk 
The Neighbor,"The Room - The Video Game

http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/547307"
The Neighbor,"If you're itching for more Tommy Wiseau, check out his short ""horror"" film ""The House That Drips Blood on Alex"".  It's not as bad/good as The Room, and it feels kind of forced, but it's worth a gander. 

http://vimeo.com/16679115"
The Neighbor,"Filmed 10 years ago? Not sure if this is just a set up, but I don't care."
The Neighbor,[deleted]
The Neighbor,"Here is the trailer! 

http://youtu.be/YGpwxHMUndk"
The Neighbor,"Meeting Tommy was probably one of the greatest moments in my life.
"
The Neighbor,If you watch carefully...you'll notice he has an obsession with balls
The Neighbor,I saw the pilot at a screening of The Room in San Francisco a few years ago. Let's just say it was vintage Wiseau. 
The Neighbor,"I still have a question about The Room; was it Dinny, Denny, or Danny?! "
The Neighbor,What network will this be on?  I'd think Adult Swim.
The Neighbor,"Oh Hai! This is the best news I have heard all day.

What platform is it going to be on?"
The Neighbor,"It wasn't shot 10 years ago. The original pilot was shot in 2007, but the show which we'll see was all completed in the past year or so. "
The Neighbor,Obligatory [You're Tearing Me Apart Dubstep mix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tng4OluHqsk)
The Neighbor,This guy was so ahead of his time.  250 years from now he will be treated with the reverence we offer Shakespeare. 
The Neighbor,"I personally love ""The House that Drips Blood on Alex"" http://vimeo.com/16679115"
The Neighbor,"Imagine if you were in that series and it was never released, then 10 years later you're a superstar and he decides to release it and ruins your career."
The Neighbor,"Greg Sestero talked about how strange working with Wiseau was, while he was on How Did This Get Made?. He apparently is so delusional that he believes the work he churns out is gold.

Edit: HDTGM? Not WTF, Greg Sestero"
The Neighbor,"Does anyone else use ""What a story, Mark!"" instead of ""Cool Story Bro"".

This is going to be absolutely beautiful and will make many teardrops stream down my face."
The Neighbor,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbuLkSdkOXA
The Neighbor,"The article actually has it wrong, the one that was filmed 10 years ago (the one with the old YouTube trailer) is nearly unwatchable. It does have one uncomfortable racist scene and everything looks like it was filmed in a parking lot. There's also no ghost subplot. "
The Neighbor,"He played us a trailer for this when we met him at a midnight showing of The Room. He signed my football. 

My erection still hasn't completely gone. "
The Neighbor,"Damn, I got really excited for a second, but I was thinking of The Lost Room..."
The Neighbor,"How do you think they'll handle the graphic sex scenes? If *The Room* is any indicator they may have to blur out some navels.

Edit: apparently my smartphone doesn't know the word ""sex"" either."
The Neighbor,"Sometimes that Tommy Wiseau, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about Tommy Wiseau, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. "
The Neighbor,"Wait, who's Ed? Why is he planning the party for Bebe, and not her boyfriend Charlie? Oh yeah, Tommy Wiseau."
The Neighbor,"> ...Wiseau launched a website for the allegedly-shot pilot, claiming that the whole thing would be coming to us all whether we like it or not in September of this year. 

Whether we like it or not. I love this guy. So unapologetic."
The Neighbor,"Is there any possibility this was actually recorded recently and he's just pretending its old?  I read that Tommy spent years raising money to make The Room, including running some - apparently pretty successful - businesses, like importing clothes/accessories, I believe.  So, considering the amount of time and effort it took him to raise enough money to make The Room (esp given its *extremely* high production values) the idea that he had enough money sitting around ten years ago to make a TV show seems a little far-fetched.


This is pretty important, because once he realized - or, more accurately, once people explained to him for the 40th time - that people were laughing at his movie because it was unintentionally funny, he decided to pretend it was intentional and pursue comedy in other ways, with universally terrible, cringe-inducing results.  If this was made after he realized that the joy of his movie was in the irony, and its him trying to be funny, then this is going to be *horrible*.  And judging by the editing, it seems like they're presenting this with a knowing wink/nod, playing up the comedy aspect, and not playing it straight like the original marketing campaign for The Room was (complete with Tennessee Williams comparisons, btw).


The Room was great in the way found footage can be great; it was a rare glimpse at what a several-million dollar vanity project from an independently wealthy narcissist of questionable foreign extraction would look like if there was no one around to guide them or tell them ""No"".  It was a very rare, fleeting set of circumstances that allowed something like The Room to come into existence.  If this was not born of those same circumstances - and it looks like it wasn't - then instead of the joy of voyeurism and the purity of unintentional comedy, we will be subjected to the torture of failing comedy written by a tone-deaf narcissist.  


Cruel as it may be, Tommy being ""in on the joke"" is probably the worst thing that could possibly happen for him creatively.  Or for his career, for that matter."
The Neighbor,"Isn't there already a show called ""The Neighbors""?"
The Neighbor,This is the list of the things I like -- this list is the list of the things I like!
The Neighbor,"""You're tearing me apart Lisa!""

One of the best actors of our time... :))"
The Neighbor,When I saw him in the fucking wig I almost lost my shit. Holy fuck.
The Neighbor,Paul Scheer and the rest of 'how did this get made' just collectively orgasmed 
The Neighbor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tVOqZIC8qU
The Neighbor,The thumbnail looks like Gene Simmons promoting his new KISS arena football team.
The Neighbor,"I think the magic that was ""The Room"" has worn off and can't be recaptured. The reason ""The Room"" was awesome because it was a clusterfuck and Tommy believed he was making a real legit compelling drama.

Now anything Tommy makes is just trying to emulate that ""its so bad its good"" and you can't do that on purpose it only happens on accident (when it does its awesome)."
The Neighbor,He also directed and starred in the pigman alongside brad Pitt and Natalie Portman
The Neighbor,"""The Room"" is the worst thing I have ever seen. "
The Neighbor,"Nobody knows who he really is or where the hell did he come from. And he has a seemingly unexplained amount of money.

Only one explanation: He is some weirdo with mobster friends, that launders drug money through his weirdo films."
The Neighbor,A non-ironic version of Garth Marenghi's Darkplace?
The Neighbor,"I'm just sitting here waiting for ""The Room 2"" to happen..."
The Neighbor,This guy is like a walking unintentional satire machine. 
The Neighbor,great name choice... because there aren't enough shows named that way.
The Neighbor,"The more I hear about this TV show, the worse it sounds. "
The Neighbor,"His Tim and Eric episode was pretty funny

http://video.adultswim.com/tim-and-eric-awesome-show-great-job/tommy.html"
The Neighbor,Ten years to work on this show. It's the Chinese Democracy of television.
The Neighbor,"I keep seeing this story, but I can't find what channel it's coming to. Everywhere just says it's ""coming to TV."" "
The Neighbor,"I am so fucking excited! I hope we see a lot of great Human Beans in the show and Lisa realized that Tommy did not heet hair itz not troo itz bowlshit, oh hi mark the chicken was good rice because Mark is just a chicken cheap cheap cheap, anyways how is your sex life? "
The Neighbor,"where is this going to air.. surely, it wont be on television... right?"
The Neighbor,"This sounds pretty *cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep*"
The Neighbor,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10874aza3SA
The Neighbor,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S9Ew3TIeVQ
The Neighbor,"Remember how in Men in Black, weird humans turned out to be aliens in disguise? Well, the writers of MIB didn't come up with the idea. "
The Neighbor,This guy and Perry Caravello...is the joke on us? Are they really geniuses???
The Neighbor,I like football. Let through one around. 
The Neighbor,"I never watched the room... but there was a cult that went to see it every weekend at a local arthouse cinema.

3 cool 5 me"
The Neighbor,This article is jam-packed with bad Internet writing cliches
The Neighbor,"Fuck, after reading this thread I totally have to see The Room again. I'm tired I'm wasted I love you darlings."
The Neighbor,[xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1400/) has shed some light on Tommy Wiseau's genesis/origin/background/history.
The Neighbor,"Good God! No! NOOOO!

That face just...*shudders at awful memories*"
The Neighbor,"So you can become famous for being a horrible director and actor?

What the hell?

I think stuff like Tim & Eric are hilarious because they know what they're doing and are intentionally coming across that way, but it's a whole other thing with this guy because he's actually serious about it. It's not like this guy is putting on a big act, but he's like the guy who claims they can play guitar and stumbles hard to even play a chord."
The Neighbor,"This guy is utterly terrible and your fandom is basically just a bunch of people making fun of a guy under the premise that you're encouraging him.

Although, if you were a Tim and Eric fan, I would accept your endorsement of this guy. I would also understand it.""

I sound like someone's mother."
The Neighbor,Is the audio in The Room (2003) out of sync with the video or is it just the release that's I've downloaded? I watch it right now..3 minutes in..it's..spectacular.
The Neighbor,Stop giving this stupid bastard attention. 
The Neighbor,"NO!

NO NO NO NO!

This movie was so terrible that I ended up sobbing quietly into the couch cushions trying not to watch it.

It is so bad it is PHYSICALLY PAINFUL.


**I CANNOT IMAGINE THE HORROR OF SOMETHING SO TERRIBLE THAT EVEN TOMMY WISEAU DID NOT WANT TO RELEASE IT!**"
The Neighbor,I wish people would stop giving Tommy Wiseau attention. He really doesn't deserve any of the benefit from it.
The Neighbor,"Is there any definitive evidence of where he is from? His wikipedia page only says he's American (which is true because he's a naturalized citizen). The guy who wrote *The Disaster Artist* couldn't even pin it down. All the author knew was that Wiseau isn't his birth name. There was also a redditor a while back that [made a compelling case that he is Polish](http://www.reddit.com/r/theroom/comments/1vklp3/i_think_i_have_found_tommys_nationality_new/), but even though it's pretty solid, it still hasn't been confirmed by anybody."
Robot Trains,"In 1998 I moved to Hong Kong. I was just a little kid, my parents moved there for work. It'd be over a month before any of my stuff would arrive, what little we brought with us. 

My dad had gone ahead and had bought some baseline furniture, gotten an apartment, etc. He'd been there a month ahead of time. 

When I arrived I was shown my new room, and there was a small assortment of toys my dad had bought to help sweeten the whole ""you just left everything you know behind, and have none of your stuff, and are in a strange country"" situation. 

Two of em were from what I can only assume to be the original version of this show, though the baddie was [much more gnarly looking](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U3_v8-thyHc/maxresdefault.jpg) back then. 

That being said, the ""original"" was from Japan and was all bullet trains. This new one is from Korea and seems to just be trains in general. But the bad guy looks so similar, and the way they transform is so similar... I wonder if they're related at all, or it's just different enough from the obscure old version that the new version figures they can get away with it? "
Robot Trains,They should have gone with 'Trains-formers' or would that have been a little too on the nose?
Robot Trains,Why was the bad guy on a skateboard?
Robot Trains,Is that evil train riding around on a skateboard?
Robot Trains,I ought to watch robot trains super 
Robot Trains,"No ? No I didn’t . 

Who would ?! "
Robot Trains,"Yeah, the original was Hikarian. The funny thing is there was already a Chinese knockoff a few years ago. There definitely appears to be some influence here."
Robot Trains,Why not?
Robot Trains,"No!  It cannot be!

[AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Khsi3OKDkQ)"
Robot Trains,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Robot Trains,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Robot Trains,This was a great read.
Robot Trains,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Robot Trains,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Robot Trains,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Robot Trains,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Robot Trains,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Robot Trains,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Robot Trains,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Robot Trains,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Robot Trains,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Robot Trains,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Robot Trains,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Robot Trains,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Robot Trains,Delta state was the shit!
Robot Trains,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Robot Trains,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Robot Trains,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Robot Trains,It was on both actually
Robot Trains,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Robot Trains,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Robot Trains,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Robot Trains,"im on episode 5. just started last night, it reminds me a bit of Dexter, i cant believe i also put off watching this show"
Robot Trains,Make sure to finish the season before joining us at /r/MrRobot
Robot Trains,"I thought it was on fx, but what surprised you I'm contemplating watching it "
Robot Trains,"Yeah man, my dad showed me the pilot when it first came out and I was hooked.  Glad to see another fan the show!"
Robot Trains,I'm enjoying it. I like that it creeps me out at times.
Robot Trains,Alright. I just gotta start this show. I've seen so much good buzz I just need to actually sit down and watch it
Robot Trains,I couldn't get into it
Robot Trains,The first couple episodes *definitely* have a major Dexter vibe.  I haven't seen the rest yet but I hope it finds its own voice.  Those two episodes were great.
Robot Trains,I JUST heard of it like this weekend. Not sure what planet I was on but so glad my friend recommended it to me.
Robot Trains,"I just have never seen a show I was willing to sit down and watch on USA. I am not sure USA has ever had this high of a rating on a TV show before but I could be very wrong. My friend watched it and said that he definitely thought I would like it. The show brings a fresh genre I guess you could call it. The story plays out well the cliffhangers make you want to download the next episode, and every episode draws you in closer and closer. I just watched the finale and wow. All I can say. Super good ratings and still could be underrated lol"
Robot Trains,"just watched the finale and I am so pumped for next season
"
Robot Trains,haha I wont say too much for readers of this post who have yet to start it but yeah Elliot and his family scare me too lol
Robot Trains,you absolutely will not regret it. i dont regret sitting on my couch watching 10 hours of it in the past 3 days haha 
Robot Trains,I personally thought the Lady Legasus stuff was funny. It seems like you just didn't like a joke that turned into a running gag. It happens.
Robot Trains,"If pretty much everybody likes something, then it is out of fetish.

And pretty much everyone likes shapely legs. Saying that is a fetish is like saying that all almost all straight men have a breast fetish"
Robot Trains,"Gee, ya think?

&#x200B;

Raven is very cute though, ngl. I just wish they made like an adult show with those jokes, not a family show. It doesn't seem appropriate for a family show like TTG!. But if they did this in Family Guy or something like that, it'd be fine! Hell, they did it in American Dad!: Francine Smith had a being spanked / masochism fetish and they had a WHOLE EPISODE centered around that, so..."
Robot Trains,"Yeah, the joke is that you never see her legs and she literally never uses them, so you don't expect them to be anything remotely impressive."
Robot Trains,I see what you did there.
Robot Trains,Yea it's like bird box or blind box or whatever that shitty Netflix movie was.
Robot Trains,It is the number one show in over 70 countries. It is possible lots of people are talking about it because lots of people are watching it.
Robot Trains,Sometimes conversation is organic and in other cases it clearly is not.  There is a different article about this show posted to this subreddit every day.  And not about the content of the show per se.  But just article after article about “this is a popular show you won’t believe what happened!”
Robot Trains,"As easy as it is to paint the popularity of just about anything in the current age as astroturfing, it's pretty obvious Squid Game's growth was natural.

1. Netflix was never heavily marketing this show in the US. It got a single trailer, and went up on the service rather quietly. They focused their marketing budget internationally, obviously expecting it to make the biggest splash in its home territory.

2. Astroturfed conversations start loud, and get quiet. Netflix heavily weighs their data on streams close to release - so you'd expect any paid posts to peak within the first week of release. Squid Game's most popular threads have emerged long after release, with conversation growing week on week.

3. Netflix was betting their chips elsewhere. Had they planned on Squid Game being a smash, do you actually think they would've scheduled Midnight Mass to release at basically the same time and get completely overshadowed? You're counting on a remarkable amount of incompetence mixed with a flawless execution for this to make any sense."
Robot Trains,"I watched Squid Game just because I was looking for something and it seemed interesting, before the hype began.

>memes start coming out of nowhere

What do you mean, ""out of nowhere?"" They come out of here, reddit. This is it. This is the source."
Robot Trains,"Netflix astroturfs all of their shows, Dark and Mindhunter included. Not all of them catch on."
Robot Trains,">“Asian media is picking up momentum so we need to jump on this bandwagon”?

&#x200B;

are you under the impression that it had been shown in South Korea before the US - that Netflix picked up a ""viral"" show and hyped it further? that's not the case. *\~3 weeks ago, nobody but Netflix had seen it.*

&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid\_Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game)

The series, distributed by Netflix, ***was released worldwide*** on September 17, 2021.\[3\]\[4\]

&#x200B;

>The week after they come out, EVERYONE in school is talking about it.

so.. Monday, nobody saying anything..  by Friday ""EVERYONE"" had seen it?

...where did people get the time to watch ads for the show.. AND watch it.?

&#x200B;

>Again, just me noticing this proves that the marketing works. 

there was ***no time*** for marketing.. just look at your own school. people watched the trailer... and got sucked in. and word of mouth took over....  did you even bother watching the trailer or just go on what ""EVERYONE"" said?

&#x200B;

***NETFLIX*** would like to know why your whole school binged it in a week - they'd like to know how/why a lot of schools did.. all over the world.

**'Squid Game' is entertaining the world. But there's a different feeling in South Korea**

The nine-episode horror series on Netflix has hit **No. 1 in 90 of the streaming service’s markets around the world,** including South Korea, where it was made.

&#x200B;

October 1.

  
**Squid Game may become Netflix's most watched show yet, co-CEO says**  
The Korean series is already set to be Netflix's biggest non-English show ""for sure,"" co-CEO Ted Sarandos says. **But Squid Game also has a ""very good chance"" of being its most popular series, period.**

[https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/squid-game-may-become-netflixs-most-watched-show-yet-netflix-co-ceo-says/](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/squid-game-may-become-netflixs-most-watched-show-yet-netflix-co-ceo-says/)

Also Monday, Netflix released top-10 rankings of its original shows and movies, which are calculated after a title has been released for 28 days. **Squid Game was released Sept. 17, giving it only about 11 days of viewership by the time Sarandos spoke.**   


did you tune in once a week to watch LOST in 2004?

 **""Name another network drama that can so wondrously turn a ? into a !""\[**79\] In 2012, Entertainment Weekly also listed the show at #10 in the ""25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25 Years"", with a hot-and-cold description: ***""Lost was initially celebrated as a moving character-driven drama with a broad humanistic worldview that also presented itself as dramatic cryptography that demanded to be solved.*** The appeal narrowed as seasons progressed and the mythology became more complex, culminating in a still-debated finale that was deeply meaningful to some and dissatisfying poppycock to others.""

&#x200B;

 SG ""hype"" reminds me a lot of water cooler talk from back then. ....but it's organic hype... it resonates with people."
Robot Trains,"Seems a lot like Bird Box to me. Eventually everyone did see it because their push worked, but well before that it was made to seem like everyone already had seen it and was excited about it."
Robot Trains,"I'm pretty sure that's what's going on with the new Dave Chappelle special too, lots of articles about him being canceled even though he clearly isn't, presumably just to get people to watch it to see what he said."
Robot Trains,[removed]
Robot Trains,"I swear the same happen with AmongUs. I had never seen anything on here about it. And the one day I see it several times on here, and soon after absolutely everywhere. Usually when something gets popular you see it start popping up slowly.

I'm nit denying those things aren't very popular, and I'm not saying there aren't genuine fans posting about it. But I think there's also a corporate push to get these things in the media."
Robot Trains,[deleted]
Robot Trains,"Sounds like you're just mad that your favorite shows aren't as popular as Squid Game, and so you've created this conspiracy theory to explain it all. That's weird dude, it's really fucking weird."
Robot Trains,Netflix must have a wicked marketing team. They pump our many dozen memes of shows and spread them all over Reddit and Instagram to build hype for their shows.
Robot Trains,People talking about a popular show is not “astroturfing.” I had never even heard anything about it before watching it and only pressed Play because I thought the pictures and trailer on the Netflix page for it looked neat. Not everything is a conspiracy.
Robot Trains,"The crux of your argument falls apart at your sentence ""They might be decent shows but let’s be honest they’re not THAT good."" Nothing honest about that. It's subjective.

Listen, this stuff does happen but the evidence people seem to trot out every time is ""I don't think it's that great, so there is something clearly fishy about the fact that other people do."" Zero beyond that, just an idea that people cannot actually be liking this thing if you don't really."
Robot Trains,Your acting like Netflix playing trailersfor its own movies is a problem lol.
Robot Trains,"its not astro turfing. lol, the show was out for like a week before marketing blew up. its just popular."
Robot Trains,There's nothing fucking else new on tv right now.
Robot Trains,"If it was this easy to make their shows popular, why wouldn't Netflix just do this for everything? They *want* you to watch as much as possible. It would only further benefit them for Mindhunter and Dark (two shows I only know about because reddit won't stop talking about them) were even more popular. If aggressive marketing could make anything popular, then every single media company would do this."
Robot Trains,"> EDIT: Y’all are getting madder than me over this lol. Apparently there was no marketing for Squid Game whatsoever and it’s just literally the greatest show ever made and the social media hype train was completely 100% organic from the moment it was released and there’s no such thing as marketing teams using social media themselves to hype their show. Got it!

Nobody said that there wasn't marketing. But you assuming that the show going viral was the work of astroturfing and your basis for such is because you **subjectively** don't think the show is that great and the hype is so quick and significantly. Which is weak arguments to assume astroturfing. Shit spreads fast on the Internet. That's why the spread is often described as being ""viral"". There's random videos, music videos and trailers that can get 10s of 100s of millions of views in a day because people spread the shit out of it. The memes and videos, and the press heighten everything. The is very memeable and so influences to like to create dank memes and funny tik tok videos hop on the trend and because they have so many followers and there's also a reason why they are called ""influencers"". Because they can make an influence on a lot of people on what they buy/consume. All it takes is a few people showing the logo of the show they are about to watch and people think ""wow a lot of people are watching this show, and I need something to watch"".

The other problem of your post is that you wrote your post like you know for sure they hired people to pretend to be viewers to boost the show."
Robot Trains,"That makes zero sense.

For once it's a korean show so why would they bother to ''astroturf'' in reddit and English speaking sites?

Astroturf would be noticeable in shows that aren't that popular or successful. In squid game it is very popular, and so are the other shows you mentioned."
Robot Trains,That’s true. I was telling the exact same thing to my son yesterday.
Robot Trains,"I love Dark, it's one of my top 10 ever best shows. And I love Squid Game too but I am aware it's never gonna be considered great acting or plot nor is it in my top 10.

Yet, days before Squid Game was released, I was already raving about it to my friends, convincing them to watch, telling them that this will be the next Alice in Borderland hype. And they all caught on quickly. 

Some shows turn viral not because it has great acting or plot, it's just very binge worthy and captivating in ways that makes everyone want to watch it."
Robot Trains,"I watched it before there was any marketing. I heard about it from a friend who took a chance on it when it first released because they watch everything. They told me to watch it…. I was like 3 episodes in and I told everyone I met to try it because I was enjoying it. 

If Netflix is pushing Squid Game they did it by seeing the initial view numbers and the “potential” and then pushing it. I don’t see why they would know before hand that this show would be huge, there has never been a Korean show that has had this type of success, if they pre-predicted it then those people have more foresight than 99% of the marketing teams at the best companies in the world."
Robot Trains,"The aspect of this that I find most irritating is when a Netflix show gets popular, it's the first result of literally any search I perform on the service. Doesn't matter what for - if I'm looking up cooking shows, I'm seeing Squid Game. Old anime? Squid Game. Docs? Squid Game.

If I literally search for the *exact title* of a movie, Squid Game is first and the actual movie is like the third row."
Robot Trains,"Squid Game appeals to -

Three types of people used to subtitles:

the ever growing group of young people who live in k-pop,k-drama land. (don't underestimate this group even if youve never heard of them)
the young people who like violent anime. 
the people who watched Dark and are like to feel ""worldly"" by watching foreign shows. 

And a bunch of fans who probably arent used to subtitles but were willing to try it:

Horror fans. 
the people who watch any Netflix Original. 
the people who like dystopian scifi
the people who like reality tv shows like survivor
the people who love Hunger Games or Battle Royale or similar but might not otherwise fall into one of the above categories. 
the people who watch whats trending on netflix
the people who watch what twitter tells them

Dark only appeals to the ""worldly"" group - but they might not have found it because it didnt gain quite as much traction. 
And it appeals to ""the people who like convoluted have-to-follow epics like LOST and Twin Peaks""  -  BUT those people are not necessarily 

Look, I wish more people watched Dark too. And I REALLY wish more people watched Dark Crystal.  

But there's a clear reason why Squid Game ""broke through"""
Robot Trains,That’s marketing working perfectly for you.
Robot Trains,"Exactly, this marketing is working extremely well. Lots of people are watching it BECAUSE of this massive marketing push.

Ask pretty much anyone who watches the show how they found out about it, and I’m pretty sure they’ll say they saw tons of people talking about it on social media."
Robot Trains,"“It is the number one show in over 70 countries”

According to Netflix. My local cafe claims to have the worlds best steak and eggs."
Robot Trains,"To be honest, it didn't seem like Netflix marketed Midnight Mass at all which is really odd considering how popular Hill House was for them."
Robot Trains,"What I meant was that memes and a big tiktok push started dropping the day it was released, getting millions of likes within hours. There’s clearly some  astroturfing going on."
Robot Trains,They astroturfed Marianne a few weeks ago. Dead silence now.
Robot Trains,Bird Box got a lot of buzz but I don't remember people saying it was particularly good. Just interesting.
Robot Trains,Among us was out for a year before it got popular. They were months into working on the sequel. So much terrible logic.
Robot Trains,"That reminds me, Tiger King is another one that they pushed super hard on social media"
Robot Trains,"What I’m wondering is why we never see this kind of aggressive marketing for other good shows. How exactly do they decide which show they’re going to shove down our throats? What’s the decision process behind it?

I mentioned Mr. Robot in my OP. It’s an excellent show, but most people I mentioned it to didn’t even know it existed. Same thing with Mindhunter (another Netflix production). Why did Netflix push the boat out for Squid Game in particular?"
Robot Trains,I saw tons of MY FRIENDS talking about it on social media. OH MY GOD. Netflix must have got to THEM too!  Nothing is real.
Robot Trains,Lots of people are talking about it. Lots of people are watching it. You’re just assuming which is the cause and which is the effect.
Robot Trains,People talk about great things. The primary marketing source now is normal people talking about it because they love it.
Robot Trains,"> There’s clearly some astroturfing going on.

No, there isn't ""clearly"" anything.  Just because you don't think the show deserves it accolades does that mean there's something nefarious.  Sometimes things get popular and you don't fully understand why.  Declaring it's ""obvious astroturfing"" is just your ego trying to process it."
Robot Trains,"Not everything is marketing though.  You've lumped all news articles and memes into ""marketing push"" and assumed it's all fake.  Maybe people are making memes because the show went viral.  Maybe people are writing articles because it's just the current hot thing."
Robot Trains,I’m not sure what you’re saying here. But do you genuinely think Squid Game is such an amazingly good show that it got it’s popularity completely organically?
Robot Trains,So you don’t think Netflix gave a bigger marketing push to Squid Game than other equally good shows?
Robot Trains,"For sure, once you get the ball rolling, it’ll roll on its own. It’s a great job by the marketing team.

If they didn’t aggressively market it, do you think as many people would be watching it and talking about it, just under its own merits?"
Robot Trains,"Yeah it’s a self fulfilling prophecy:

1.	Release show
2.	Aggressively market it
3.	Everyone starts watching because all their friends at school and work are talking about it and they don’t want to miss out
4.	Media picks up on it and starts cranking out articles.

Everyone in here is acting like there is no step 2, it just goes from step 1 to 3"
Robot Trains,"Do you really think anyone would watch NINE episodes just because they saw a fucking meme?

I mean maybe some viral marketing gets people interested and gets the ball rolling— but it’s good enough to hold interest for 9 hours and still get top marks on literally every review platform you can name. 

Bird box, which you mentioned, on the other hand petered out almost immediately and has terrible scores on every review platform. I mostly heard about that from friends shitting on it. I never bothered to watch as a result. 

So yeah I think it grew and continues to grow AROUND THE WORLD because it’s quite good.  A marketing push can only do so much."
Robot Trains,"Do you not understand that people actually talk to other humans about things they like? I have told multiple people about Squid Game. If they watch it, and like it, they might tell someone else too. You know what made me watch it? I have liked a lot of the Korean shows that have come out in recent years, and this is another take on the Battle Royal genre. I'm not even sure what the last show or movie was in that realm. Hunger Games? In fact, I'd be willing to bet that the huge rise in BR video games contributed to the interest in this show.

It's always weird to see dumbass comments from people thinking that it is impossible for a popular thing to *be* popular. As if nothing is real and no one can think for themselves. People like the show, talk about it, make memes about it, etc. Is it your first day on the internet or what?

Obviously there was marketing, but like literally everything that goes viral, people share it. No one but you has said it was completely organic. You just decided to be upset about something.

There was plenty of talk about Dark and Mr. Robot when they were running. Mindhunter was a big deal when it came out. You're examples are literally years late. You're wondering why here isn't a lot of talk for those shows now? There already was before those shows ended."
Robot Trains,"They saw that word of mouth was really strong and decided to lean into that fact AFTER the show was already out. That's just smart business, but it doesn't change the fact that people were already getting excited about the show on their own terms. I watched the show the day it came out, and none of the marketing was happening at that point outside of the standard trailer they release for all their shows."
Robot Trains,"This looks to be one of the exceedingly rare times when step 3 genuinely happened before step 2.

All Netflix seems to have done immediately after the release was place the show high in the recommendations and post a few things on their social media.

It seems to have gone viral on its own. I can't imagine Netflix hasn't been throwing marketing teams at it since it went viral though."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,The Stranger Things Christmas Special sounds like a spectacularly bad idea.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Excited for Marriage Story, I've only read good things about it. Seems like Laura Dern might win a Oscar for it which she should because she's a national treasure"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I’m excited/curious about Marriage Story.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"YOU: Season 2 really excites me. I was absolutely blown away with how good the show was, and I'm hoping that it doesnt branch away from the vibe of the first season."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Really looking forward to season 2 of Lost In Space, the first season was pretty great."

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"I like Adam Driver too, but can we at least get a blurb that doesn't make me think that using a cheese grater on my junk would be more entertaining?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,The Sabrina one wasn’t bad.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"It's really brilliant. If it happens to be showing somewhere, check it out in cinemas."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Agreed.   Just a fun show to watch that feels like the episodes fly by.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Apparently filming finished in July.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,People like Christmas movies around Christmas?  Who knew?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Is this the part where we kick you?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"If you're saying everything else sounds generic, that just means you haven't watched them. Lost in Space sounded generic as fuck, but it was amazing. You shouldnt judge an entire tv show based on a one sentence description."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,">A stage director and his actor wife struggle through a gruelling, coast-to-coast divorce that pushes them to their personal and creative extremes."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Interesting take...
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Oh really? For some reason I thought it was much longer than that. Thanks.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,yeah that sounds like a lifetime movie. gonna be a pass from  me. at least Girls had a gimmick.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Well you'd be missing out on a favourite for best picture and definitely one of the best movies of the year. It's a seriously brilliant film.

Also, blurbs aren't a good indicator of quality."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Some people just need ""gimmicks"" in their entertainment."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,that seems like a pretty standard dystopian story move. it's an easy way to fill episodes out and explore the characters before everything went to hell. it's also cheap to shoot in standard before-world so you don't have to use the budget creating and decorating another set with dirt and firefly posters
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,We about to get the tutorial as a TV series
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I liked how Lost gave back stories to characters. Each episode would cut away a few times showing the survivor's life before the crash.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"If I had to guess, the first episode is 30-45 mins of regular life and maybe ends with **that** moment."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Makes sense for an adaptation. Gives it a little more weight and easily leads into the games intro.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,First episode is going to be Joel filing his taxes. Episode 2 is him mailing stuff at the post office.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"How well it will go, totally depends on how much time they're actually spending on ""life before"". I'd imagine most show watchers have been burned out about stupid filler material and spending too much time on ""before the outbreak"" would be just that. People aren't watching the show to see the normal lives."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I recently started Party Down and now that I picture everyone who bitches about sci-fi or fantasy on the internet as Roman from that show it all makes more sense.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"In these kinds of movies I love the part just before the outbreak starts. Where the main characters hear rumours of what's happening, but shit has not hit the fan yet. You start feeling tense as you wait for it. And then BOOM! The outbreak happens and there's chaos. You see how bewildered and uncomprehending they are about what's going on as they try to grapple with the unbelievable situation."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Isn’t life before the outbreak just a crappy family drama?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"So… like normal life?

Why the hell do we want to see that?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"""HBOs new show will finally set up the story"""
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"I just don't want to see another Station Eleven situation where the interesting post apocalypse setting gets sidelined to drag the audience through meaningless identity melodrama at upper class dinner parties from the Before Time. I know it's a cheap and easy way to pad the runtime, but you kill your pacing when you wallow around in flashbacks that don't matter and a setting that isn't relevant anymore. Civilization is gone and 90% of people are dead, nobody cares that your rich parents were mean to your lesbian girlfriend at Christmas before they died and money became irrelevant. 

I would hope that flashback use will be brief and relevant."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I have always wanted to see Joel file his taxes
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Life before the outbreak is our normal ass timeline up until October 2013. Sounds like mundane filler.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,First game can be done in 8 eps. 2nd game can be done in 2 seasons if they want to streech. How many seasons did they say they would make ??
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Watch out reddit, here comes the “they’re running this show before it comes out” crowd."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Didnt the writers/creators/producers just come out the other day and say a few days ago that the show would not deviate from the games?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,That would be funny if it turns out to be a rom-com set in the year before the zombie apocalypse.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Press X to doubt.  I've heard this song and dance before.  I'm talking to you Fear the Walking Dead.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Could they not? We know what life was like before the outbreak. Exactly like it is right now.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Because that’s the exciting part, right?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I hope it’s not an inundation of past scenes like they did with the Resident Evil joke of a series
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,They are gonna spend an entire episode dedicated to Sarah and make us fall in love with her before...ya know...aren't they?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,That's called filler. It's the hallmark of a cashgrab.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Fair enough but I'm really hoping it's not full of flashbacks all the time.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Sounds like Black Summer
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Bet they'll show a bunch of doubters and anti-xxx groups thinking this ""massive outbreak"" is a hoax, and they all inevitably spread the virus."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Last of Us had possibly the best intro of any game. I'd be interested in seeing some more build-up to the intro sequence and further exploring Joels relationship with his daughter.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Does anyone actually care? Life before the apocalypse is just real life.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"If it’s well done, I enjoy the thrill of a societal breakdown on screen. Means you have to have normal first. Like others have said though, I hope it’s not overdone."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I love watching the setup to fungal zombie plagues just as much as I like watching it unfolding! Yay!!
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,It’s a good move for anyone who has not played the game.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Putting my money on the major premise being people acting like the outbreak is “fake news” up until the point that it consumes the world.  And then some.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,“Last of us Director scrambling to make 8 hour video game a full series”
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"I feel like hollywood has bastardized what “backstory” means. I dont need to know where Joel went to school and the childhood fights with his brother through multiple flashbacks over multiple episodes. All I need to know about him is that he was a single dad, he and his daughter had a good relationship, and his brother is close enough that when shit hits the fan they rely on each other. TLOU game set up his character beautifully in 15min, I dont see any reason to extend it. 

They could literally do a shot for shot remake of the video game and it would win multiple awards."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"oh god, they are going to make me rrrrrreally love Sarah this time. I mean, it was emotional enough losing her in the game and that was just a bit at the start!"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,ive always wanted this. yayyyy
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Did walmart Joel work at Walmart or target?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"I can’t be the only one that finds one of the favorite part of apocalypse movies/shows is the beginning where no one really knows what’s happening yet and then it’s just chaos. I’m excited to see it expanded. 

Like the baseball game in Quiet Place 2 or Rick’s hospital wake up and the Atlanta bombing in TWD."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,So TWD with humans being the main bad guys and then zombies…wait a second
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Keep telling ya this is gonna suck. I don't want it to, but everything is pointing in the wring direction"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I honestly im only interested in the Life Before the outbreak on the opening scene. After that? it will probably be filler scenes to reduce costs and it honestly... doesnt look interesting to me.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Oh good. Because there's nothing more interesting than watching normal people go about their lives in a normal world.... *That's* the stuff *I* want to see in a zombie survival show...
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,So the least entertaining part?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I'm ok with this. They have to flesh things out somehow. I'd be cool with flash backs. I want to see where Bill got his magazines.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"4 seasons in, there is no outbreak, but they continually end each episode with a sit down at the TV when some ""big news"" is hitting the world.

And next episode, it's just some dumb shit some celebrity did. Then the writers continue on making their own creation with ""Last of Us"" in name only"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"My two cents: I felt that TLOU’s story was so effective because the pre-pande… errr, outbreak life of characters we followed was barely-remembered, save for a few, sharp, painful reminders of loss (like Joel’s “God, I miss coffee.”). Us seeing that in clear recollection might take away from that."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Saving money on FX…yay…I’m sure that won’t hurt the story at all
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,So...filler before the real story?
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,*yawn*
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Why
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,That sounds..........horrible.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Cue protracted, soapy flashbacks to keep the budget down."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"I think the casting for Ellie is terrible but what really made me laugh is the director told her specifically *not* to play the video game. You know the shows gonna be flaming dog shit when the director says something as ridiculous as that. Oh don't go view any of the source material your acting for, because ? Some of the dumbest shit I've ever heard"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,“Sigh” no spores now inventing new story before the show has even aired. Strike 1 and 2…
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Awesome... That's always what I said was missing from the game... Normal life before the outbreak.

This is basically ""we have budget for 30 minutes of CG so the other 20 minutes we just want normal shit. Also we want to avoid people watching 55 minutes of two white people walking around so this will allow us to be inclusive and diverse with our casting. Big win all around boys."""
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,I hate this
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Druckman going give Joel a backstory to make him into an absolute monster? Probably.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Hope they don't do it like they did with The Passage. :'(
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,It’s going to be the first 22 episodes as life before the outbreak and the last two episodes of the season will be the initial two hours of the outbreak. I’m so excited!!!
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,Don’t care.  If it doesn’t build the characters is some new and interesting way it’s just drivel filler to make a season longer.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,If they want to save money and go cheap why not just make the season shorter and save us from the bullshit filler backstory.
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,This feels like it's being overhyped everyday. I really hope it's good
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,The First of Us
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Oh great, it’s gonna be like Lost with a shit ton of flashbacks, isn’t it?"
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Start the episode with Joel holding Sarah at her birth.

End the episode with you-know-what."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Going to skip that, not watching this show to see everyday life."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Bad idea, show's a lack of confidence in the core idea. I've seen enough post-apocalyptic shows to know that you don't want to spend too much time mired in a story that's outside of the basic genre that draws people to the show. You only have so much time each episode to tell the story you want to tell. How much of that story actually takes place in this genre setting? Are people going to watch a post-apocalypse show that spends half its time in a pre-apocalyptic world? I want to see the story that plays out because of this scifi conceit, not slowly put together a character's backstory through jumbled and selective flashbacks. Let me see those character traits develop through this unique, genre based story. I can see down to earth dramas on many, many other series."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Wtf 
Didn’t they say they were jus strictly adapting the games? There’s like 10 minutes of “before the outbreak” in the whole series"

The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Aside from character introductions I don't see a need for a pre break out existence. The main character gets a cheap coffee and gas at the local Gulf. His wife calls saying that she has a cough......crap goes south pretty quick. 

Jump to current time. Main character wishes for the old days where he could easily get cheap coffee at the local Gulf.

Basically I get it. Life was normal. We already live that now. I don't need to see it."
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.: Reawakened,"Yes, when Hollywood runs out of idea just make it a prequel or sequel. But prequel is becoming more and more prevalent these days."
The Gift,"I remember watching this as a kid, it's definitely the kind of show that I think would do really well on streaming if it were on Netflix or something. It might be a bit dated, but I'd imagine it'd be pretty easy to throw it on and not pay too much attention, much like The Office or Friends."
The Gift,Misstaaaa Sheffield...!
The Gift,"This was one of the very first shows I saw every episode of (Along with Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Family Matters), around 10 or so. I loved it, and looking back I think it was primarily because of Niles and CC’s eternal barbed back-and-forth’s. Still one of my favorite TV rivalries-to-romances."
The Gift,"Oy, the number of times I’ve been a sobbing mess and Fran has pulled me out of it with her humor. I can’t hear a nasally voice without smiling. My parents actually made a rule about the Nanny and anything Fran related because I watched the reruns everyday and when they weren’t on I looked for them online. I wasn’t allowed to watch in the living room unless they were out and my brothers wanted to watch too. My husband deployed and I had a miscarriage soon after, I sunk into the absolute worst depression of my life and the only thing that could make me smile was the Nanny reruns. I’m pretty sure I owe Fran Drescher my life because I was at such a low point with dark thoughts and she was shining light of happiness. Now my husband and I watch it together once in a while and because I peeked at one of my gifts I saw that he got me the boxed set for Christmas and I couldn’t hold it in and cried happy tears. Honestly I’m tearing up writing this because I just love her so much. It’s the one show I reference on the daily and my husband loved to point out I’ve unintentionally picked up words and phrases from her


Edit: Because SOME PEOPLE (a kibitzer that goes by u/Cajun_kick_ass) thinks only older women are into the show because it’s the dEmOgRaPHiC tHat ObsSesEd oVeR iT, I’m 24 and actually 24 not the Fran always claimed to be but actually 24 born in ‘96"
The Gift,"I always thought the Sheffield kids didn’t really add much to the show. Of course they had to be there for Fran to be a nanny in the first place, but I would totally watch a half hour of just Fran, Niles, CC, and Maxwell with Yetta and Sylvia showing up every now and then."
The Gift,"She's the Sofia Vergara of the 90s, total smokeshow with the voice of a harpy."
The Gift,MISTAH SHEFFIELD!
The Gift,still have a crush on her. i actually love her voice
The Gift,As a kid I didn’t get any of the references.  As an adult the show is hilarious.
The Gift,"Is something up with Fran Drescher? Is there some sort of super soft ""The Nanny"" push happening?"
The Gift,I watched the show for the Niles - CC kvetching.  Niles was a savage!
The Gift,"The writing was top-notch. The zingers, the comedic timing, it was all great."
The Gift,"Fran Drescher on the The Nanny was certified dime piece.  Throw in the fact that she was blue collar chick from Queens, boy was I in love."
The Gift,"It’s so underrated as a streaming sitcom possibility compared to things like Friends and Seinfeld. People need those shows with interchangeable episodes that you can have on in the background while cooking or paying bills, and you can look up in time for a gag, laugh, and go back to what you were doing."
The Gift,"The special guests were amazing, the Elizabeth Taylor episode is one of the best of the show, and Pamela Anderson had a recurring role. Even the fake-cameos (like Cher) were great."
The Gift,"When Fox 5 here in NYC used to air reruns of it at six (long before they air shitty celebrity gossip shows, along with back to back reruns of The Simpsons) and I was surprised by how good it was. Also, her normal voice is actually not bad."
The Gift,Ok but where is it streaming?? How are they finding it??
The Gift,"Fran Drescher is honestly still super hot to this day

She was on Broad City a couple years ago and her body has not quit."
The Gift,"The Nanny was sort of my comfort show as a kid. Me and my mom watched it together. My mom looked just like Fran when she was younger/ the Jewish cultural aspects were really nice. It was also a killer slow burn romance- even when the main romance actually happened it remained fresh and exciting! The characters were all just delightful. I honestly think as far as laugh track sitcoms go, you can't do better than The Nanny."
The Gift,Bobbi Fleckman!
The Gift,"It is SO WELL WRITTEN 


The comedic timing is impeccable, everyone has good chemistry, the characters grow and evolve 


And the fashions are amazing 


It’s honestly one of the best"
The Gift,That theme song is really good too!
The Gift,"Fran is everything. She has style, she has grace, she was there and that's how she became the nanny."
The Gift,"I was never a fan of the show, then or now, but I have noticed how well her fashion sense has aged.  So like when the show came out, her fashion was supposed to be flamboyant and ridiculous and over the top.  Along with the laugh, it was part of what hade her iconic and memeable before the time (She was a meme before the Web).  But a lot of those same outfits would look pretty normal in any major urban center these days."
The Gift,"This show is amazing. I was watching it every evening on French tv around 97-98-99 I guess, when I was young. Love it, sometimes I watch episodes even nowadays lol"
The Gift,"I was extremely sick in grade school back in the early 00s, and watched literally every episode of The Nanny in a feverish haze. Still have that theme song stuck in my head. I also vaguely remember Fran eating a fistful of wasabi and speaking with a very normal voice."
The Gift,"I like the Nanny, Fran is hot. Like you have that dime piece working in your house and you ain't trying to mac up."
The Gift,She was so damn hot on that show.
The Gift,"I wish it was on Hulu or Netflix, i used to binge that and The Golden Girls all day on youtube."
The Gift,"Frasier is the true gift that keeps on giving. I was too young to appreciate it when it was on TV, now it’s one of my favorite shows of all time."
The Gift,"I love this sitcom so so much, it taught this little goy Yiddish at a young age. It had a lot of the same magic that made I Love Lucy successful, similar slapstick female lead with a “foreign” straight-man husband. To this day I say “hello hello” a la cc babcock all the time and nobody but me ever gets it 😂"
The Gift,It's a great show
The Gift,One of my most favourite shows to watch. The lines and quips always are funny. Especially CC and Niles.
The Gift,"This is still one of my favorite shows, it’s just a good comfort show. I constantly try to find it on streaming services but it’s never available.  They do give it on Cozi weeknights though. I’d watch it every day if I could!"
The Gift,A classic. Loved it. I can still hear her voice by looking at the picture
The Gift,the Nanny is very funny
The Gift,Aww cc and niles my two faves of the show
The Gift,"About 10 years ago during its heyday she did a guest spot on Good Day LA. She was filling in for Jillian Barberie, the entertainment reporters they had at the time. So they were on location at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood and they were setting up her shot. You could clearly see a big microphone near her face and it looks very funny. Everyone's giggling and without dropping a beat she says,"" Well that's not the first time I've had something long and hard near my face!"""
The Gift,"People talk about comforting shows, the kind where you get sucked into this little world and it's all warm and safe. This show was that for me. 100%"
The Gift,"She was even better in This is Spinal. 
Hey “young fans”, find that as well."
The Gift,I always had a big crush on her as a kid
The Gift,Need this on Netflix
The Gift,Anyone know where I can watch it? I've been go ogling like crazy but it's a hard show to find
The Gift,This! My favourite show even after 21 years.... can’t believe its been so long.
The Gift,Fourth voice i ever fell in love with.
The Gift,"God, I love this show. I'm glad that I managed to watch it from start to finish when it was on Netflix."
The Gift,This show also got super meta at times... like when Nanny Fran ran into Fran Drescher at a hotel and they talked about her pregnancy being a ratings grab.  A challenging dual role!
The Gift,"I was thinking about watching Californication, but heard about some... *scenes* and I can't, Zima will always be cute little Gracie."
The Gift,"Her voice, It's unbearable"
The Gift,"I couldn’t watch this because of her voice, couldn’t stand it! lol"
The Gift,I wanted to fuck Fran Drescher so badly for like three years when I was a teen. Definitely enhanced my cougar fetish a little bit.
The Gift,"I watched that show and I'm so glad to see how Fran has aged with grace and still looks great, has her raspy voice and a catchy smile.

So many actresses from those days don't look anything like themselves anymore, not because they aged but because of surgeries and countless injections with botox. So afraid to age that they self destruct trying to find eternal youth."
The Gift,"She very much shaped my preference in woman, absolute goddess"
The Gift,Why isn’t this Streaming somewhere!! It’s a classic and should be available online at least on one platform!!
The Gift,This needs a new season with a focus on the kids being adults and such
The Gift,Why can’t they put this on Netflix? Come on!
The Gift,Not gonna lie.  I mostly just watched this for Fran Drescher's legs as a kid.
The Gift,As a kid I totally did not appreciate how absolutely banging Nanny Fine was.
The Gift,Just be sure to cover your eyes when you see sweet little Grace on Californication!
The Gift,"I remember watching the pilot with my dad and I still watch this show. So happy younger viewers are discovering it.

Fran Drescher is my hero - she has overcome so much. She’s also BFFs with Twiggy. 😜"
The Gift,Younger deaf fans
The Gift,"The scene in the sushi bar is my absolute favorite:

https://youtu.be/3YLkLOYrswU"
The Gift,"Fran Fine basically raised me when I was a kid tbh. Love the show so much! 

Also, it’s on Amazon Prime Video 🇨🇦 (as of mid 2020 anyway)."
The Gift,"Most annoying sitcom ever, after Friends."
The Gift,Love catching it on COZI TV
The Gift,"This show makes me miss my Mother so badly. They both possess shining confidence and such a fun personality. It might sound odd but Fran was in some ways even an example that women could stand up for themselves against others, something I really only saw my own Mother do as many women (at least around me) still felt the need to please others and fit nicely into a defined box. Seeing her on television provided a bit more affirmation about navigating the world in different ways. *And that fashion*, hello! I’d love to know where some of those pieces went! 

It’s funny, too because when I was a kid I always assumed that Fran and my Mother were somehow related seeing that they even looked similar. 

Anyone know where the entire show can be streamed?"
The Gift,"One of the greatest shows ever.  I just started rewatching it and it's just as funny if not more.  Also as an adult, you gotta appreciate her outfits.  I found this [Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/whatfranwore/?hl=en) recently that shows who she wore on different episodes. Pretty solid."
The Gift,"I have a tv antenna, and I've found The Nanny playing on CoziTV right around the time I go to bed, and it is a great show to fall asleep to. Good enough that I enjoy watching it, familiar enough that I don't have to pay too close attention."
The Gift,Good lord I had a huge fucking crush on her
The Gift,"Criminally underrated. This was the one show my kid and I could both agree was awesome. The Nanny was better than Seinfeild, but was never taken seriously because of the image of the protagonist. Better casting, better writing, better guest appearances.  But she got rich as fuck, so that takes some of the sting out of it."
The Gift,How does anyone withstand that voice though
The Gift,I hated the show back then and still do.
The Gift,Someone just got their yearly residual check.
The Gift,So why the hell is it still not on streaming?
The Gift,I love this show. I just wish it could be streamed somewhere.
The Gift,First I saw YouTube videos on my suggestion for this show and then someone tweeted about it on my TL and another person posted about it on fb....
The Gift,I started watching it from the beginning recently.
The Gift,Maybe if Niles mother hadn’t been such a monster he and CC could have had something special.
The Gift,"I like the episode where she eats the horseradish, lol"
The Gift,One of the few shows I wasn't allowed to watch. Why? Her voice.
The Gift,If Roseanne could have just kept her big stupid mouth shut people would be saying the same thing about her show. The early seasons were so damn good.
The Gift,I'm the best part about that show!
The Gift,"I knew my friend loved me when they got me the FULL box set of the series for my birthday a few years ago. Franella has been my queen since childhood!!! The entire cast is amazing, but her and Niles together oh my...it’s so perfect."
The Gift,and she was in UHF!!!
The Gift,So they watch it on mute with captions?
The Gift,I just wanna know if she moans in that voice.
The Gift,"Never realized it growing up, but Fran was a good looking broad back in her day."
The Gift,"I wasn’t a *huge* fan of the show, though I did enjoy it. But I’ll never have anything but respect for that woman. She’s been through hell and back and is still living her life to the fullest."
The Gift,Her voice is unbearable.
The Gift,I loved this show as a teenager. Just rewatched it after like 8 years. It still holds up. Still so funny
The Gift,I could never get through 10sec of her voice :/
The Gift,Heyy Bobbi Fleckman
The Gift,If I never hear that godforsaken laugh ever again I will die happier
The Gift,This is when you knew it was time to go to bed.
The Gift,"Looking for a raise, Ms. Fine?"
The Gift,Did anybody else think that Chandler's girlfriend in Friends was Fran Drescher when they were younger?
The Gift,"Never cared for The Nanny, but I do appreciate her part in Saturday Night Fever"
The Gift,"In the summer of 2003 I got fired from my summer job, was super depressed and watched reruns of this show every day. I actually at one point told my boyfriend that I couldn’t go out that day because it was the day Fran was having the twins on the show and I didn’t want to miss it..."
The Gift,I remember in college they had one of those older stations running a marathon of this show and I had left it on while gaming. I remember I thought her voice was so annoying then by the end of the day I was sitting with popcorn just binging it lmao
The Gift,"If 2020 had a voice, it would be Fran Drescher’s."
Black Lake,"That sounds quite interesting. The name makes it sound like a zombie thing like World War Z, Day Z or something. Maybe that's why it got cancelled."
Black Lake,"I wish its prequel was better;
Y: The Last Man


^(It's weird how well their titles go together)"
Black Lake,These posts are great. Keep it up!
Black Lake,"Hmm, from the name I would expect a different show. Maybe the reason it was canceled is that it was just poorly named."
Black Lake,Quarry should have been more entertaining than it was.
Black Lake,"Yeah I loved the idea, and the people involved and their previous projects, but for some reason Quarry just didn't stick with me. Watched it all but hardly remember it."
Black Lake,I dropped it after like 4 episodes. Best thing I got out of it was knowing Alice Pagani existed.
Black Lake,"Yeah I do. It was awful. Sadly, all Netflix Italy productions are lame.

Amazon Prime Italy's productions, on the other hand, are really strong."
Black Lake,Oh yeah she’s stunningly beautiful. Like if Finn Wolfhard were a girl but more beautiful obviously.
Black Lake,"If you like that sort of series opening, you should check out at least the first episode of ID: Invaded.  The main character wakes up in a mysterious dimension with no more context than the viewer has.  Without spoiling too much of the mystery of the first episode, I think I can mention that it's a sci-fi crime series, sort of similar to Psycho-Pass."
Black Lake,"McShane's gotta be 80 or so.  I hope he is alright.  At that age, one health issue can lead to another."
Black Lake,"""Pain or damage don't end the world. Or despair or fucking beatings. The world ends when you're dead. Until then, you got more punishment in store. Stand it like a man... and give some back."" (Al Swearengen)"
Black Lake,"I didn’t know about this show, but now I am curious.  It’s hard to think of someone that would be an apt replacement for McShane.  I think Roth might be about perfect to step in.  I really want to check this show out."
Black Lake,"I hate that.  I absolutely love Ian McShane.  Hope he feels better soon. That being said, Tim Roth is the bee's knees and will be an amazing replacement."
Black Lake,Love them both. Wish McShane getting better soon.
Black Lake,"Fuck whatever cocksucking ailment you got, McShane. Get fucking better."
Black Lake,"Best Wishes to McShane, we will need to make a big ass jump to save him."
Black Lake,"Alright, guys. You know what to do. Tune up the dirt bikes. Assemble the busses. Build the ramp. Alert the local AM station. We’re having a good ol’ fashioned fundraiser!"
Black Lake,"From his wiki.

>Long before Lovejoy he was a pin-up as a result of appearances in television series, such as Wuthering Heights (1967, as Heathcliff), Jesus of Nazareth (1977, as Judas Iscariot), and Disraeli (1978)



Stupid sexy Judas...


Also it speaks to his acting chops if he can make a portrayal of Benjamin Disraeli sexy."
Black Lake,"still disappointed by his priest character in GOT being in it for only one episode. He was really interesting

stay well Ian. Peerage when?"
Black Lake,Hope Mr. Black Magic is alright
Black Lake,"I fuckin adore Tim Roth, and if you all haven't rewatched Four Rooms recently, make that happen this week."
Black Lake,Am I the only one astonished to find out he’s *that* old? I was thinking about 15 years younger.
Black Lake,"> I, that could cut a throat but sleep the sleep of the just, spend six fucking wakings trying to find a piss pot with my dribble, and wondering when I got to be so old.

Swedgin Wu hang dai"
Black Lake,"He has looked the same age for decades.  He looks almost the same now as he did 20 years, a lot is to do with the hair though."
Black Lake,From the last couple of things I saw him in he looked/sounded like he had one foot in the grave already.
Black Lake,"May he live forever.  Fucking cocksucker. 

(Don’t hate me, it’s a Deadwood reference)"
Black Lake,That cocksucker
Black Lake,"*""Swingen!""*"
Black Lake,"Perhaps (in my mind) Gabriel Byrne is the only apt replacement for McShane, but Gabriel is up there in age as well. Roth can be sinister in a sort of Tolkienesque ""Wormtongue"" sort of way, but he lacks that *dark leader* feel. Ah: he is *the fool*, rather than the *King*."
Black Lake,It was obviously the gleets.
Black Lake,"Most underrated comment here. To you sir I say, cool beans."
Black Lake,You know I have a hormone disorder!
Black Lake,Have you seen portraits of a young Disraeli? Dude was a fox.
Black Lake,"I just looked it up, and it says 79 on wikipedia.  

The advantage of usually being viewed after hair and makeup, I guess."
Black Lake,The key is too age real quickly and then you're 55 from 30-80
Black Lake,"I went through a period where I was mainlining 80s miniseries and was shocked at how old Ian McShane looked in *War & Remembrance*. Curious, I looked it up and realized he was already 46 when it aired in 1988."
Black Lake,It took me way too long to discover Deadwood. Jesus he was amazing in that show!
Black Lake,"Dan, fetch my blade"
Black Lake,"Yeah they definitely have different energy, but both have a good bit of gravitas.  I think Roth has a good deal of menace, but he is less imposing to be sure.  I prefer McShane, but Roth doesn’t bother me.  Good call on Gabriel Byrne.  I would like to see that too."
Black Lake,[deleted]
Black Lake,aka the Patrick Stewart method
Black Lake,Goddamn cockfucking Shakespeare that is.
Black Lake,"Patrick Stewart is 81, so yeah. That tracks..."
Black Lake,">The first three episodes of Season 2 will be immediately available on September 4th, with the remaining five then being released weekly.

I guess that's a first for an Amazon show."
Black Lake,"Finally! It's awesome to have a release date, I can't wait!"
Black Lake,"Amazon fighting off people who want the season released way earlier: ""You stay the fuck back, or I'll laser you, goddamn it! I will laser every fucking one of you!"""
Black Lake,Unclench your asshole fellas.
Black Lake,"[Here's the trailer in case anyone missed it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYnSEW4sXrk)  
  
Also if you're wondering how they finished Season 2 so quickly, they were filming it before Season 1 released.  They were also writing Season 3 while they were filming 2.  If you're familiar with the comics at all Season 3 will feature [](#s ""Herogasm."")"
Black Lake,The fall stimulus we've all been waiting for.
Black Lake,Was hoping for something in July or August but I’ll take it.
Black Lake,doom patrol and the boys this year. lets gooooo
Black Lake,This is the very opposite of diabolical
Black Lake,Fuck yes! I've had a fucking shitty week and reading this news makes me so bloody happy.
Black Lake,"This is like that scene in The Matrix. Now, you could take the fucking red pill, right? Spend the rest of your life jacking off, crying into your chai tea green latte, what the fuck. Or... you could take the blue pill. Or is it the red pill? Anyway, take the other pill and quit being a cunt."
Black Lake,I don't think I can wait.
Black Lake,Lucas Hood and the gang.
Black Lake,"The Boys is creative. Season 1 was pretty damn good, as long as you don't expect to be uplifted by the story."
Black Lake,"FUCK, I was hoping for next week :("
Black Lake,If they don't fuck this up (which I hope and think they won't) it will be one of the best TV Series EVER. It already is IMO
Black Lake,"Hope everyone enjoys the show, I had a great time making some of it ;)"
Black Lake,"Fackin’ lovely, bring it on!"
Black Lake,At least we will have 1 day in 2020 that doesn’t suck.
Black Lake,Fucking diabolical
Black Lake,"September? Ugggghhh, we might be dead by then."
Black Lake,Diabolical...
Black Lake,"OH YES! 

Now I need to rewatch season 1."
Black Lake,The boys are back in town
Black Lake,"Just rewatched the first season and I completely forgot how abruptly it ended. So many things go on in the final two episodes. 

Can’t wait for Season 2. September 4th feels so far away."
Black Lake,[deleted]
Black Lake,[deleted]
Black Lake,"I’m OK with the weekly release.  If an entire season is released on 01Jan and you binge the whole season by 02Jan, you got a long 364 day wait for the next episode."
Black Lake,May be a unpopular opinion but I'm actually pretty happy they chose to go the weekly episode route. Season one had unreal ending scenes if season two follows suit it will leave you hyped and anticipating the next episode.
Black Lake,[deleted]
Black Lake,Yes!!! The same day as the new Tony hawk game!!!
Black Lake,Glad their doing this. With LotR and WoT series upcoming as well I hope they'll be weekly releases.
Black Lake,Fuckin’ diabolical
Black Lake,THE BOYS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
Black Lake,I started reading the comics because of the show and good god the show is so much better. The comic books are needlessly gory and drag on with meaningless dialogue.
Black Lake,That's a disappointment was hoping it would be next month
Black Lake,"I watched the first two episodes yesterday. They were okay.

Does it get better?"
Black Lake,released weekly? ew
Black Lake,If it’s been ready for months then why wait so long?
Black Lake,That's later than I expected.
Black Lake,"Are you serious..

Fuck sake man. I thought it would be July..and it's not even released at full. Fuck me..."
Black Lake,"Thrilled Aya Cash is joining the cast as another Super. She has range, but plays a bitch perfectly."
Black Lake,Wake me up when September begins
Black Lake,Hey that’s my dog’s birthday
Black Lake,"Looking into reading all the comics, will the tv show be based on those? Or is it a totally different premise? 

I’m gonna read it regardless, I just want to read them before I see it on tv."
Black Lake,I watched 3 episodes and didn't find it compelling enough to keep watching. I can't be the only one who doesn't think it's so revolutionary to the comic book genre.
Black Lake,September?! What the fuck!? And not released all at once? Poppycock!
Black Lake,I knew Bezos was gonna get me something nice for my birthday.
Black Lake,"While I really do hope everyone enjoys it, all I can say is never have I enjoyed a series so much only for the last five minutes to totally destroy my interest in watching the next season.

&#x200B;

I just don't want to see what I suspect is coming up."
Black Lake,Fucking diabolical news!
Black Lake,Weekly release. Fucking hell. Don’t start this pls
Black Lake,Just in time for covid 2.0
Black Lake,"They need to drastically improve on the female characters, they are real drab. The main character too. Amazing what they did with Homelander. But the show isn’t called Homelander. The Boys side of things needs an epic boost."
Black Lake,Followed by weekly episode . Uugh I want it all lol but oh well
Black Lake,Fuck and yes
Black Lake,Finally!
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I don’t really care either way, but it’s really bizarre that Joel and Ellie come across, I think, 0 infected after KC."
The Bonfire of Destiny,They didn't need tons of infected just a spattering like when Ellie meets David. I feel like that whole interaction would have been better if there was some infected so it's more of a trusting moment for her like in the game
The Bonfire of Destiny,[removed]
The Bonfire of Destiny,[removed]
The Bonfire of Destiny," I missed Ellie fighting infected with David. It made more sense in the game that he wanted to “partner” with her after seeing how useful she was. In the show it felt like we skipped a beat and his fascination with her felt less earned.

The other action sequence I missed was the fight/escape at the university. It didn’t need to be as big as in the game and Joel could still get stabbed by a bat but I missed the suspense of Joel hobbling out as Ellie has to be the protector for the first time. Felt rushed in the show."
The Bonfire of Destiny,They got it backwards. Infected are way more critical to the first story than the second.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I get where they are coming from but I think they overcorrected to the point where you're questioning why a vaccine is needed.

The series is probably 1-2 episodes light."
The Bonfire of Destiny,The real issue is it only being 9 episodes. 2 of those episodes were back stories and the rest had to also build up other characters.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I do think there should have been more. The story is of course about the characters, and their relationships... But the infected felt completely shunted to the side in the second half of the story. Joel and Ellie run into, what, 1 after Sam? There are opportunities to make them more influential. You don't have to cut every single action sequence."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"It's so weird that people see this argument as binary.

Either ""the story isn't about the infected! it's about J and E and their relationship! more would ruin it!"" or ""there was no infected at all! total lack of action! so boring!""

There's a fucking middle ground, people. They could totally have added *some* more infected without killing the story, without making people bored of the violence. No one is asking for 30 minutes of non-stop infected killing every episode. No one wants TWD again. But yes, a *little* more of infected would have been great, and I look forward to a *little* more of them in season 2."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I definitely think 9 episodes was way too short, and am surprised that they didn’t at least go to say, 12 episodes, to flesh out some of the conflicts and characters. But, maybe that’s all that was greenlit and now they are going to get way more leeway to stretch things out and give some storylines some air. Here’s hoping at least."
The Bonfire of Destiny,It did feel like they stripped a little too much from the game
The Bonfire of Destiny,Rat King is coming
The Bonfire of Destiny,"There were two weird uses of the Infected. 1) that the world wide cordyceps web never came back beyond the episode it was referenced in feels like a miss, and 2) the Tress death kiss is still super weird

Other than that, I don’t think it was over or under done. There was a whole scene where the earth opened and a Belcher showed up"
The Bonfire of Destiny,Translation: “The Last of Us” will have a shitload more money in the budget for effects.
The Bonfire of Destiny,Balance fixes for next patch. Nice!
The Bonfire of Destiny,Epic series. They need to turn it into a video game.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"It was a serious flaw for me. The story starts on top of a serious,cataclysmic threat and sticks to it for 2 episodes. We see infected again once after that. It's a great story but they travel around freely never having to deal with infected again. Ellie's importance fades. I watched the middle episodes thinking ""oh shit!! they're going to have to enter the buildings"" but no infected anywhere. They have to use the tunnels, no infected, they travel through forests, no infected. They travel to a university then to an empty town and enter a home with no infected anywhere again. The last batch of episodes I basically told myself the infected aren't a danger I guess. I dont see it as a necessity to have the story we got. It's still top tier TV but the show kinda shifts into a generic post apocalypse rather than the world it started off as. Games need high numbers of encounters to keep engagement but this goes hard the opposite direction."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Its weird. The show has really driven home to me how little the infected actually have to do with the plot, but still their absence makes them feel like less a part of traversing the world. I didn’t mind them not being around much, I expected it, but it almost seems backwards to commit to more of them in season 2 by when there’ll be Scars and the WLF to represent now as well."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"For me, without infected the relationship between Joel and Ellie fell a little flat because their bond felt somewhat unearned. In the game they are pushed to the limits and that experience makes their bond so much stronger. So maybe an episode or two were missing with more action between them and infected."
The Bonfire of Destiny,It's a good show but it just feels like blander more watered down version of the game. The show is just missing that constant tension and feeling that anything could happen at any time.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"The show is probably one of the greatest game adaptations ever. It's amazing how similar they kept a lot of set pieces and dialog. Amazing work.

However, as a show, it's really not that compelling and very boring. You miss out on a lot of key moments and growth between characters because the story moves at a quick pace. The episode where Ellie meets David would have been much better if they included them fighting the infected together. Stuff like that is missing greatly."
The Bonfire of Destiny,They are blazing through the story and skipping all the big action sequences.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I mostly enjoyed the show but I would say pacing and choosing which storylines to focus on more, was the biggest issue of season 1. Also the finale was a bit short and disappointing, ngl"
The Bonfire of Destiny,"This show has been so strange to me! I loved Last of Us the game... and I love the show... but it feels like they should have had 3 more episodes. The story beats were there but it felt kind of forced, the father/daughter relationship between Joel and Ellie. Like we didn't get enough time with them to develop that relationship in the show with all the side stories (episode 3 is an absolute masterpiece in storytelling). I haven't watched the final episode yet but I dunno... 12 episodes would have been great."
The Bonfire of Destiny,[removed]
The Bonfire of Destiny,The lack of action started in episode 3
The Bonfire of Destiny,The monkey paw curls and turns S2 into one of the Resident Evil movies.
The Bonfire of Destiny,When I hear a great show is making changes to address fans' concerns I just assume it's about to get significantly worse and so far I've been right every time
The Bonfire of Destiny,"How will all the defenders constantly screaming ""its not about infected! Duh!"" be able to say that after every episode now?!"
The Bonfire of Destiny,With how little the infected were shown I almost forgot they existed.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Too late, you already skipped all the good stuff"
The Bonfire of Destiny,Season 1 treated the game as if it were a walking simulator. It was such a bizarre choice.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Yeah i got bored tbh it was like- Meet new characters, they die. Repeat. 🤣"
The Bonfire of Destiny,My wife and I just watched ep 6 and she said she didn't like the last 2 episodes cause they have almost no action. This is a woman that closes heir eyes in every gore scene on any movie/show.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"It felt like an adventure of the week buddy cop show. It was fun to look into this world a little more, but as far as overarching risk within the plot it really didn’t feel like there was any…"
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I really did not like the infected in the finale, it highlights the problem they are trying to avoid

Because of the needs of the scene, the infected just runs up and kind of pins the person and makes noises in front of them while suspense builds

After the suspense is allowed to build for a little bit, the person somehow manages to get the thing off of them.  Usually they manage to reach a nearby weapon.

Then, even though the infected just did it's whole ""pin them and make scary noises"" routine, somehow a bite mark appears on the person's leg.  Darn, now they are infected.

/yawn"
The Bonfire of Destiny,The show felt incredibly hollow to me.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I liked the Bill and Frank episode, and the explanations for the origin of of cordyceps and Ellie's immunity. But overall the show just wasn't as good as the game. I think it needed more time maybe idk. I wasn't quite buying the relationship, especially at the end."
The Bonfire of Destiny,Oh something tells me they're will be something else that will be complained about in S2
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I'm two minds about it.

At first I was really enjoying the fact that the zombie apocalypse in LOU was just the setting, just the catalyst for human stories. I'm not big fan of body horror and gruesome death, like you see all the time in Walking Dead. Walking Dead also seems to ask the question ""how can we have the protagonists fight more zombies?"" while LOU asks ""what adventures could the protagonists experience in a zombie-ridden world"".

What also made me double-down on this opinion were the zombie episodes of this show - the second episode and the second Kansas episode. The zombie portions were really clichéd and gamey. Seriously, in the second episode, once they entered the building you could re-construct the following story from zombie clichés. Zombies hiding in a seemingly empty building? Check. Building falling apart exactly when the protagonists enter the building? Check. Debris falling right behind the protagonists, blocking their way back? Check. Zombies resistant to bullets? Check. Hasty, nervous reloading? Check. Protagonist trying to be silent and stepping on something loud? Check. One of the protagonists getting bitten but hiding this fact? Check... And the the body horror / zombie kiss that was made just to shock the audience...

And the zombie portion of the second Kansas episode was kinda short to be full of clichés, but it felt like a video game. A boss fight while Joel is suddenly a perfect sniper (after missing the truck several times a few minutes earlier)? C'mon, that was outright lazy. All in all, I find the zombie bits of the show to be the worse parts (with the exception of the mall episode, which was really boring and dragged-out).

But that being said, the show sometimes goes too far and forgets about the zombies completely. I don't want more zombie fights (especially given how sub-par this show handles them), but I want more reminders that this is a zombie apocalypse. We have had many sight of ruined, destroyed and desolate world... but almost every time without zombies. As a big Fallout fan my default impression from these sights and stories is that it's an aftermath of some war. Why couldn't they show some zombies walking around there?

Big offenders in this regard were the 8th and 6th episodes. Both were completely lacking any zombies and 8th episode didn't even mention them. Don't get me wrong, both were probable the best episodes in this show, but they could have been part of ANY post-apocalyptic show. Seriously, in episode 8 I completely forgot about the zombies until Ellie started screaming ""I'm infected"" in the climax... and I remembered that zombies are actually a thing in this universe. In was kinda jarring.

That is probably mi biggest criticism of the show. It has some great production value, great stories and great characters... but it doesn't build the world particularly well and the main narrative is disjointed. Like, twice in 9 episodes we jumped to a flashback for 90% of the episode. First flashback was a great story, but did nothing for the overarching narrative. The second flashback served to enhance Ellie's backstory... but it was boring as hell. And the whole narrative and the worldbuilding seems to be undecisive about how important and threatening are the zombies."
The Bonfire of Destiny,Im not sure those that havent played the game will be ready for the season two though. It will be quite a big departure from season one. Im more interested whether they will announce TLOU3 soon after this as the source material had finished.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"It’s not lack of action, just lack of actual zombies. The show is good, it got me hooked. But there is a lack of zombies."
The Bonfire of Destiny,Hopefully it does. I loved both games and the show but the lack of infected was just a bad idea. They are the *reason* the world is in the state it's in. There didn't need to be walking dead level of monsters but God damn there needed to be alot more than we got
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Honestly, i thought they sprinkled in action well enough. I really don’t care for excessive gun shots and screaming. Would’ve likes the bloater to be more of a problem than it was.

Hopefully they do the Rat King well."
The Bonfire of Destiny,Is anyone gonna care about infected when we get round 2 of everyone being pissed off by *you know what*?
The Bonfire of Destiny,I don’t know maybe it’s because I  didn’t play the video games but I didn’t have a lot of the issues that people in this thread have 🤷🏾‍♂️. Are there parts I thought could have been done better? Certainly but I could say that about any show that I’ve watched. I don’t think this is #1 greatest show of all time or anything like that but that’s a huge weight to put on any show especially one in its first season. Right now I think it’s pretty great with potential to get better adaption purists be damned.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"The truth is episode 3 needed to be cut and that 1 hr 20 mins of time desperately was needed in other places, including Joel and Ellie having more encounters with infected.

Episode 3 is great tv don’t get me wrong it’s just very irrelevant to the story being told which becomes a problem when we run out of episodes telling that story"
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I'm sitting here shouting to them not to listen to the criticism like Cooper in the tesseract in Interstellar.

I worry they'll over-correct. 

In the show, these things are so damn dangerous that if they show fights with them more than a few times a season, it will quickly feel like TWD where there are no stakes whatsoever and the zombies can be dispatched with such ease that you wonder why society ever fell. 

So I'd rather have too few than too many. Personally."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I, for one, have thoroughly enjoyed the overarching threat of infected with a lack of their constant appearance. The same goes for the need to show gore. How they showed Ellie >!killing David!<…Hitchcock would’ve been proud."
The Bonfire of Destiny,[deleted]
The Bonfire of Destiny,"When the whole hubbub came out of episode 3, as one of ""the greatest episode in television history"", in the grand scheme for overall series progression and impact to the story of Ellie and Joel, in my opinion it was a wasted episode that could have been dedicated to more infected action, tension, or mcguffin chasing."
The Bonfire of Destiny,The real monsters were the uninfected.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Not what I expected going in. Not my thing, I expected way more action. I’m assuming most people who liked it didn’t play the game."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I believe no spores and lack of infected hugely decreased the gravity of the situation. 

We see pockets of people living in gated communities and surviving. They die of starvation, lack of medicine, raids etc. rather than the infected. So why would we need a vaccine? Just don't venture to deep or beyond.

I mean it doesn't have to be action scenes. Seeing infected and changing their road, seeing other people getting killed could have been enough ro remind us what's at stake."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"That’s super disappointing fr.  The show is so awesome bc it is the story of the people in this crazy situation, less to do with the situation itself.  Making it all about the infected seems like it’ll ruin why the show is so great"
The Bonfire of Destiny,Who’s complaining about the lovely personal stories?
The Bonfire of Destiny,My biggest complaint is pacing. In the game we spent so much extra time traveling and having personal moments along with some serious action beats. Felt like it needed 1 or 2 extra episode of peril / personal moments in there. Hell the college piece in the game was such a big part of the story in the game and yet in the show Joel just gets stabbed and that’s it.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I don’t want “a lot more infected” I just want enough to make them feel like a threat, to remind the audience why the world fell apart. Obviously you cannot recreate gameplay where your character is an all powerful god compared to everyone around them, where Joel kills dozens of infected at a time in a TV show, but there needed to be more threat…weather it was action packed with a few infected or stealthily getting past a bunch, they should have been there

Edit: This isn’t to say I didn’t love the show, it’s an amazing adaptation, but it’s fair to criticize things we love and want better even if it is good!"
The Bonfire of Destiny,Naw fam they fucked up the finale. I won't be back. Walking Dead it is...
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I'm cool with the amount of infected in the first season, but it wouldn't have hurt to sprinkle more in here and there.  They're there to keep you busy as you go from location to location in the game.  They're there to pad the length of the game... and I don't mean that in a bad way, it's just that it's usually the point of a video game and people want 10+ hours of it for their money, so you have to devise an excuse to have that much gameplay through plot.  This is a TV show and there is no gameplay.  I'd have liked to see *something* out there in all of those rural areas they go through.  Maybe not big fights but there's really no random infected just walking around out there?  Episode 3 shows a glimpse of a random loner infected that walks into one of Bill's traps, and the one buried under rubble, but that idea isn't really visited again and it's like they don't exist at all outside of cities."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"It definitely felt a bit too fast paced. Other shows drag on and barely move each episode while here we have one that moves a bit too fast. I still really enjoyed it though and looking forward to season 2.

Also the game coming out on PC, I've never played the game. Looking forward to experiencing it all."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I’m happy with the lack only because I really like what they are doing with the rest of the story and killing zombies has been done to fucking death.

Also it allows my wife to watch most of it with me which is nice."
The Bonfire of Destiny,I gave up watching this BORING zombie show without zombies……..
The Bonfire of Destiny,Please don't do the same thing the walking dead did. Where the zombies took a backseat because they want to show that other humans are the real monsters
The Bonfire of Destiny,...now that the initial hype is gone ...
The Bonfire of Destiny,"The show did something the game failed miserably at, i dont even care if joel dies."
The Bonfire of Destiny,The hype on this show is odd because it's no different to others of this genre. It's the same characters over and over
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I’m glad it didn’t do like the Walking Dead did which was put in zombie kills for the sake of the Talking Dead’s bit after the show.  

There’s plenty of time for it.  And do it with style and substance.  Not belligerently."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"This makes me sad because that's what audiences did to The Walking Dead, complained about everything until they had to put a huge zombie fight into every episode until it got so repetitive the story fell apart.  This show ISN'T ABOUT THE INFECTED!  Shows like this never are.  It's about Joel and Ellie's relationship."
The Bonfire of Destiny,It was like war. Mostly boredom followed by terror for a few minutes.
The Bonfire of Destiny,I look forward to the complaints that there’s too much action
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Why does this sound like it’s gonna turn into Aliens? 

Ellie: We'd better get back 'cause it'll be dark soon and they mostly come at night. Mostly."
The Bonfire of Destiny,We gonna get the rat king.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Frankly, the fact that it wasn’t just another zombie show was one of the best things about it."
The Bonfire of Destiny,Lack of action made it good. Dont sell out to overmedicated producers!
The Bonfire of Destiny,Finally some less circle jerky takes than the main sub.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I don't even think the show needed any more action at all particularly.

But it is weird we only saw clickers what...2 or 3 times? 

That's literally my only gripe, I didn't think the pacing was poor or anything. Didn't even need an action sequence, but just some reminder that they exist."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I was expecting one more big infected scene somewhere toward the end of the season, but the more I think about it the harder time I have pinpointing where it could have gone that would have been believable and moved the plot forward. Somewhere mid season I started to think we'd see one in episode 7 with Riley, but when I watched it I realized it would not have been believable for Ellie to survive a full on hoard even with Riley and some pipe bombs. Plus it emphasizes just how intense the threat is that they could barely take down one together and they still both got bit. I think the only place it might have worked would be to have kept the sequence with David in, but then I question the plausibility of that group he's amassed being that large and surviving in the area when they are largely women and children and so hungry that they are eating their own dead. Plus, if it's a small encounter it is basically repeating the same relationship building experience of the museum encounter with Joel. Probably could have worked but it wouldn't have been big enough to meet the bar for emphasizing the larger threat and I don't know how much it would have added."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I preferred the lack of ""zombies."" It makes this series about the humans and not just another Walking Dead."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I think they missed the perfect middle ground that a 10 episode season would have given. Personally, stretching out the university scene would have made the rest of the show that much more impactful ie. having Joel still interact and kill the man from David's group and still having him get stabbed, then having Ellie fight through the horde with an injured Joel.

Also, the infected fight with Ellie and David I believe would have greatly solidified not only the viewer's initial trust in David, but also would help ""earn"" a reason for David to take such a liking to Ellie. The rest could have been the same. 

I am beyond excited that we even got a show this fucking good based on a game I know we all love, but there is undoubtably quite a bit of missed opportunity with a few rushed scenarios."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Some stalkers in an office building with the lights off would have been cool, we’ll probably see some in the next season."
The Bonfire of Destiny,Personally I find the zombie stuff to be the least compelling part of the show.  I think it got the the appropriate amount of story time.  Endless zombie battles are mind numbingly dull.
The Bonfire of Destiny,[removed]
The Bonfire of Destiny,[removed]
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I feel like the lack of infected was warranted IMO. Other than the opening scene, the whole thing takes place 20 years after the initial outbreak. Humanity has learned to adapt and deal with the infected. It would almost take me out of it to see humanity still having to CONSTANTLY fight off waves of zombies 20 years later. That makes sense from a game play perspective but not so much from a narrative one. On top of that, the whole point of the show is to show how shitty people have become as a result of all of this. The show that people want with lots of infected and fighting the infected would need to take place in the months after the initial outbreak, not 20 years later. I think the show made a lot of good decisions in their direction."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"My only major complaint about season 1 is the lack of infected. They got so many iconic moments spot on, but cut so many iconic infected scenes. So I'm happy to hear that this will change moving forward. 

I get it, they don't want to just throw in action for the sake of action, but I wonder if they went too far the other way to try and create distance from the label of being a game story."
The Bonfire of Destiny,A lot more… considering we have been seeing zero infected in the last episodes.. 1 infected is way more.
The Bonfire of Destiny,Yeah like the impression I got was that infected quite literally don’t exist in the cold or outside of cities. So why doesn’t everyone just fuck off to the woods then? Made the hard push for the cure seem a bit pointless.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Meh, I have had my fill with actual zombies over the past 10 years of our noses being rubbed in them. I want a compelling story - which we 100% got with the first season here. Incredible show!"
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Yeah I can see why they had to shorten the season.

There were only 3 or 4 memorable episodes at the most.

It was a great effort, but not a series I'd watch again."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"People will always complain. There was zombie action when there needed to be, and they told a perfect story. It's one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. There are plenty of shows and movies out there if you need your gratuitous zombie violence fix that don't have the depth of this show"
The Bonfire of Destiny,Part of what is so enjoyable is the episodes where you almost forget there are infected. Getting so involved in the characters arc and then being reminded “oh yeah the worlds over run by fast mushroom zombies” is what made it work in my opinion.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Coming from someone who did not play the games, I didn’t mind the lack of infected. I think a major theme of the show for me was that humanity were the true monsters, and focusing on those human elements was awesome."
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Only real complaint I have is for all the shows that exist with 20+ episodes per season, is that this easily could have been at least 11 episodes. Loved it regardless, just wish it lasted a little longer. 3, 5, 8 and I stand by it. Great adaptation. Can’t wait for season 2 & 3 playing Part 2 on PS5 3rd time right meow"
The Bonfire of Destiny, It was the most boring season of television that I had been looking forward to. Show sucks so much. Just kill all the characters already I don’t care.
The Bonfire of Destiny,"Lol… I mean, the zombies were literally the only interesting part of the show, the ONLY new concept to an otherwise extremely generic plot and… they just sort of neutered them. 

Frankly the damage is done. I don’t care about season 2. This show was like every single other apocalypse dystopia movie ever. I was getting deja vu. Throwing some zombies into an otherwise boring, repetitive, and depressing plot is not going to fix anything in season 2. Just another “people are the real monsters” story trying to pretend it’s deep

People have said this game has like, one of the best stories in gaming history… umm… glad I never played it since that was obviously a lie"
The Bonfire of Destiny,"I found the makeup for the infected to be very unconvincing and not particularly scary. In the few scenes of infected, especially the one where Ellie stabs the infected in the basement, it just looked like some dude in crappy makeup. I'm glad there was so few infected in the first season. I also don't know why they are promising more infected for season 2 when the second in the series of video games was much less about infected."
The Bonfire of Destiny,And more golfing
The Bonfire of Destiny,I’m just saying. The walking dead used infected as a crutch during the boring shit and this show didn’t have that issue.
Saint Young Men,"Thanks, had no idea this was a thing, will check it out. Merchant! Samuel Barnett!

I hope someone eventually makes a miniseries about those Australian gay-bashing gangs I discovered a year or so ago, and the related police negligence. Sounds like similarly fascinating material.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/australia/scott-johnson-gay-murder.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/world/australia/scott-johnson-gay-murder.html)

https://www.sbs.com.au/gayhatedecades/"
Saint Young Men,Great little mini series. The focus on the victims and the families is something I like to see from these dramas rather than the exotic nature of focusing on their murderer. I also liked they managed to show how much the LGBT community felt angered by this. I have followed this case from the beginning so it was interesting to see it dramatized. Everyone involved really brought some stiring and sensitive perfomences and Merchant was terrifying.
Saint Young Men,"Came here to post about this too. It's a very well done series, tragic though and disgraceful that the police didn't spot that these were murders. I agree with you that they did a great job making the victims feel real. The police didn't do this, looks like they just treated them as caricatures"
Saint Young Men,"I have a real problem with it. 

Firstly, it's no It's a Sin. The writing is bad, not shamefully bad, but it could be so much better. It feels lazy, dumbed down and artificial, like it's hitting points on a board instead of trying to, you know, be good. 

My main issue however is it feels like it's written by a straight man, for a straight female audience. 

It is the Liberace of television! BBC does Queer as Folk!

It gets it's toes ever sooooo slightly wet in the context, the larger issues, the contemporary gay narrative in London of which the Stephen Port murders have so awfully examplified, around G( and chems in general), around Grindr culture, around aging and body shaming and idolising, but then runs back into the shore as fast as it can, to tell a pretty pedestrian story about how a mother's intuition is always right. Which is, I'll admit, part of the story, but it's not the really important part. 

I had such high hopes for this series and it's disappointed at every turn. It's a real shame, no, it's criminal. The victims deserve better. The gay community deserves better! So much of this offends me! It gets so much wrong, around chems, around hook-up culture in general, or it simply refuses to talk about it and, again, just uses the story as an excuse to tell ""mothers"" they're always right. 

There's a really compelling, era defining, story in there and they've just missed it! It hurts!!!

I will say, Merchant is great in his performance but the script gives him nothing to work with, absolutely appalling."
Saint Young Men,"Stephen merchant doesn't help this, I just cant take him seriously and doesn't really end up saying anything. Everyone acts really wooden."
Saint Young Men,"I thought it was pretty boring. Felt like people acting out a Wikipedia page.

And in the last episode the direction was distractingly bad."
Saint Young Men,"The writing in this is just terrible. There is no subtlety whatsoever. Prime example was the first episode when the policeman mispronounced Anthony’s name about 5 times - we get it! 

Poor writing, poor acting and really doesn’t delve in to some important issues."
Saint Young Men,"> a miniseries about those Australian gay-bashing gangs

There's a series based on those cases called Deep Water."
Saint Young Men,Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
Saint Young Men,"Yeah, I guess they chose to tell the story from the families’ perspectives but I’d have preferred to see elements from the victims’ perspectives too. Especially the deaths themselves - it needn’t have been gory."
Saint Young Men,I thought he was the best part of an otherwise boring kitchen sink drama. He really elevates it.
Saint Young Men,"Oh man, I watched that show when it aired in 2016, but didn't connect it at all to those cases, which I only read about in 2020. That's funny.

I think I'll watch it again!"
Saint Young Men,The show wanted to focus on the families of the victims and the botched investigation.
Saint Young Men,"Will be written by *The Sopranos* creator David Chase.

Saint Young Men,"Oh great, another prequel tainting the success of a great show."
Saint Young Men,Hopefully it is not half just gangsters sitting in therapist offices being boring as hell like the show was.
Saint Young Men,Tony actually has a flashback to right around this time when he sneaks out after his pops take Janice to the amusement park only to find it out is just a place for all the made guys to meet.
Saint Young Men,So Do the Right Thing?
Saint Young Men,"Good call.  Exciting.  

His dad was a character that was talked about so often and hyped up a lot and definitely something that would be worth expanding on.  

Also, maybe we can get closure on [whether the retired detective Christopher kills actually killed Dickie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9H7eLKEwAs) or if Tony was manipulating Christopher."
Saint Young Men,Good point. Maybe they are going to cast Imperioli as Christopher's dad?
Saint Young Men,Chrissy :(
Saint Young Men,Mind blown
Saint Young Men,Christopher's role as Tony's secondary was tragic and wrenching. His whole life is lived in the shadow of petty crimes and missed ambitions. When Tony has Christopher 'take out' the man who may or may not have killed his father - it's like Chris knows then and there that he's fated into this place till death.

Saint Young Men,"Thor 2 had a lot of great moments and a lot of ""why am I watching this"" moments."
Saint Young Men,"I like the first 3/4s of Genysys really, it just totally went off the rails and started making no sense at that point."
Saint Young Men,Thor 2 was god fucking awful dude. 
Saint Young Men,Oh man those were awesome. I had scary Stories to tell in the dark that was my sheeeeit
Saint Young Men,No fucking way! 
Saint Young Men,He's also in the wire. Apparently he just wanted to be a kid in great crime series
Saint Young Men,"Because at this point in the plot, Tony is grooming Chris to take over day-to-day operations so Tony can isolate and protect himself from law enforcement.  He wants Chris to pretty much be a intermediary and if Chris feels indebted to him, then he has a blood relative he can truly trust.  And it works.  Chris references several times after killing the detective what Tony ""did"" for him.  He even tells Adriana in confidence that she cant understand what Tony had done for him and how he would do anything for Tony.

Also, throughout the show, Tony talks about the only people you can trust is family.  He tells his Anthony Jr. that friends will let you down but family will always be there. Ironically, Tony is constantly betrayed by blood relatives.  His mother and uncle Junior literally tried to assassinate him.  Later in the show, Tony's cousin, Tony B(played by Steve Buscemi), in a way, betrays Tony and the entire New Jersey family by assassinating Phil Leotardo's close friend, which leads to the entire war that unfolds.  Tony has no faith in Anthony Jr taking over ""the family business"".  

So Tony lives by this ethos that you can only trust family yet most of his blood family has let him downs or tried to betray him.  Chris is really the only logical future for Tony to continue leading the New Jersey family without outright losing control."
Saint Young Men,"Also, this being just between Tony and Chris doesn't quite make sense.  Chris's dad was important and so amongst the family it would be a big bragging point to murder this person.  Tony would want some kind of credit, yet it's never mentioned before or after.  No one else knows about it.  David Chase has said Tony should have killed Chris early on, and I think this was a clever way to show that Tony doesn't trust him but he can't tell that even to his closest friends....or even the audience.  Even though Tony gets betrayed by his family, he could never be seen as betraying his family.  "

When Jai Courtney is one of the best parts of your movie, you have fucked up your movie. "
Saint Young Men,"Pretty sure he confirmed it, too.

Not that it wasn’t glaringly obvious."
Saint Young Men,"When Kat fucking Dennings has a better, stronger, and more fleshed out character arc than your main villains, you have fucked up your movie. "
Saint Young Men,He never confirmed it. And it’s meant to be ambiguous as much as I can see how death is possible. 
Saint Young Men,"It was a great series and one of my favorites. The first two seasons aired on ABC and didn't get the ratings they were hoping for. It was not a cheap show and filmed all over the world. I think viewers expected movie-like adventures (Harrison Ford did play Indy for one episode) instead of a coming-of-age story.  Family Channel took it over and aired the final four films. Lucas envisioned it as an educational project which could be shown in schools to get kids interested in historical figures. 

When they brought it out on DVD, they included a lot of supplemental material and reworked and paired the episodes into 22 two-hour movies. They added some new clips to make some episodes work together. The youngest version of Indy, Corey Carrier, had grown quite a bit by this point, so they digitally shrank him to make him look younger in the new footage. They dumped the series' George Hall as elderly Indy bookends and that was okay with me. 

In the fourth Indiana Jones feature film, Indy mentioned that he rode with Pancho Villa, a direct reference to the two-hour premiere of Young Indy. Most didn't get the reference but it made me smile that the show hasn't completely been forgotten."
Saint Young Men,I really enjoyed this show back in the day. Not sure why Disney+ hasn't put this up on their service. Maybe they're waiting for this summer?
Saint Young Men,"I just watched a video about this show over the weekend.

Saint Young Men,"It’s such a fun premise for a series and the cast is great, so I can mostly forgive it for not being very good."
Saint Young Men,"The books were great choose your own adventure, but I enjoyed the other series of young Indiana that didn't correspond to the show. Love how he'd just pop up somewhere new every book, Colorado, Ireland, the South, China, Russia, and giving young me a little taste of the area."
Saint Young Men,"The best episode was the one in Prague. ""Just instal a phone at the new location, as simple as that"" .. or similary worded"
The Mire,Is it anything like Justified?
The Mire,"[spoiler](#s ""I think him and starbuck hooking up was... awkward. The guy is 54 and she's 37. The age difference was just too cringy for me."") Other than that I like the way it ended up. Also the [spoiler](#s ""daughter running for sheriff? Really? Longmire has 13 scars. It's a rough job and she never really seemed like she would be suited for it. It seems contrived her running."")

I did like the ending though. Love that show. "
The Mire,"When does it switch from procedural to overarching storytelling? I had wanted to watch it so bad and when I finally got to, it wasn't especially good or interesting unfortunately (I lasted about 5 episodes), but the part when the alleged switch happens gets so much praise, I'd like to know if I should give it a second chance. "
The Mire,"I really enjoyed the final season, despite every episode being devoted to bringing back former characters I'd completely forgotten about, lol.

It's not a perfect show, probably not a great show, but I enjoyed it for what it was and will miss these characters and the seemingly sky high crime rate in Wyoming."
The Mire,[deleted]
The Mire,"My mom started watching Longmire on Netflix a while ago. At first, I didn't like it (of course, I wasn't really paying attention to it) then realized Longmire was worth watching simply for the gorgeous scenery! Once I started to actually watch, I realized it's a truly  good series. The actors are great, the storylines entertaining, & overall just a really good show! So now, as a fan of Longmire, I think that if you do watch it, you will get attatched to the characters. They're done so well, it's easy to believe that there is a real Absaroka county in Wyoming somewhere, with all the same people living there. "
The Mire,I have not seen season six yet but Season five was a dumpster fire. 
The Mire,[removed]
The Mire,It's kinda similar. I started watching it after finishing Justified and it filled the hole quite well. You might like it if you liked Justified.
The Mire,"It's more to do with the actual crimes.
It's based on a series of mystery novels and follows the Sherrif   the Sherrif doesn't take shit like reylan "
The Mire,"Justified hit amazing highs an forgettable lows, but it was very good overall. Longmire was just very good all the time and occasionally great. Never below very good."
The Mire,"Season 2 is  probably when the show starts to get good.
"
The Mire,"It never fully does that. There is typically a crime of the week throughout.

It is a good show anyway."
The Mire,"Be forewarned, even when it does 'switch' the crime of the week stuff is still very much present, it just has a stronger narrative to go with it."
The Mire,"Thanks, I'll look into it again eventually."
The Mire,"Big fat ditto to your entire comment.

Big fat props for your amusing username."
The Mire,It's global.its a Netflix original it should be there now
The Mire,[removed]
The Mire,"It's not, Netflix only acquired rights to 4 countries from Warner Bros when they picked up the show. It already had international sales deals with international broadcasters that weren't invalidated by a and e cancelling it."
The Mire,[removed]
The Mire,Oh  i assumed cause it's a netflix original it's released all at once like punisher
The Mire,[removed]
The Mire,"Most are. But there are exceptions. Longmire is one as it started as an A&E show and already had international ""owners"" before Netflix uncancelled it. They still ""own"" the show regardless of that.

This actually was a reason why Netflix passed on picking up Agent Carter."
The Mire,[removed]
The Mire,"The reason isn't just as simple as ""sci-fi/fantasy isn't as mainstream/popular as you think it is""  because while that might have been the case even as little as 10 years ago it is NOT the case any longer. Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Avatar, Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy are all proof of this. 

The reason why major networks can't find the success is because they keep hedging their bets.  The cable networks (and to a lesser extent CW or WB back in the day) embrace the genre. Walking Dead is a zombie show. Game of Thrones has dragons and white walkers.  Flash actually has superheroes and villains in costumes. 

Network shows hedge their bets by trying to making the characters or their situations more ""relatable"".  They push the most fantastic elements into the background to not scare people away and/or save money on special effects. Then they fall into the mire of following other successful shows.  Its a longstanding trope, but there were a few years where every tv show had a mysterious evil committee out to get the protagonists.  Following LOST and BSG, more shows started to have drawn out arcs that seemed vaguely planned out but where the writers were absolutely making things up as they went along. And because of those two trainwrecks, even genre fans were not willing to put up with meandering mysteries anymore. There is no trust that the writers have any long-term plan or the freedom to follow through with it. 

Look at something like Terra Nova. Multiple mysterious factions, dinosaurs in the background, and too much time focusing on love-stories and basic family problems with some of the most boring and uncharismatic people ever. It was basically a ""what not to do"" guide for modern television that was trying to check off every box of ""this is what we think people like from other tv shows""

"
The Mire,[deleted]
The Mire,"There are a couple of reasons. One, they are too afraid of committing. Sci-fi/fanstasy is at its best when it's using technology/magic/unique circumstances to explore the human condition and the ethics behind the possibilities of things.  Shows that go that direction tend to get watered down though out of fear that audiences won't understand, so you get b-movie garbage and formula show X, but ""on a spaceship!""

Two, sci-fi/fantasy shows necessarily need a lot of world building to make sense. The whole point is seeing how things happen in this unfamiliar place, so there's going to be way more non-plot information and exploration than a show set in a hospital or police station (where we already know exactly how they work). That means the shows are a slow burn to get good and it can take quite a while before all the parts start fitting together. Networks are nothing if not gun shy, and they will cut and run rather than give a show a few seasons to find its feet."
The Mire,I think the biggest problem is simply that there haven't been any network sci-fi shows that weren't riddled with quality issues in a long time.
The Mire,[deleted]
The Mire,"One problem Sci-Fi/Fantasy frequently has is it's insatiable need for immediate results. They keep tweaking and changing and pandering in order to placate the networks, and they tend to lose sight of what makes them popular in the first place."
The Mire,">It is like the creative team pitches an idea, ""What if electricity stopped working?"" and then the show runners have no idea how to keep the audience interested.

I think this might speak to a larger problem in network television in general: that being the length of a show's season. There are many shows that have great premises, but not every great idea can last for 20-26 episodes. Of course things are going to be strung out and diluted to make a show last that long. However, it does seem like we are recently getting more miniseries that better fit the show's length to what the story can actually support."
The Mire,Budget. It costs more to make a sci-fi show look good.
The Mire,"Redditors are always surprised to find out they aren't a very good sample of what the general population are actually like. Why is that?

Sci fi is not popular at all. All the popular shows that have sci-fi/fantasy elements are something else first, sci-fi/fantasy second. All these hard sci fi's don't catch on because they put that in priority over the other genre. 

It sucks but it is what it is"
The Mire,">Resurrection, Jericho, Revolution,

these are all really bad shows. the problem with tv scifi is that no one makes quality program."
The Mire,"I'm like... really surprised nobody's talking about Supernatural in their write-ups of the genre in TV.

Supernatural's going to become the longest-running genre TV show in America next year, its 11th year."
The Mire,"> I think when there's a big obvious mystery, viewers don't want to wait for it to be answered. It's that simple.

Well put.  Occasionally a show rises to that challenge, but they are the exceptions.  Then there are the puzzles like ""Revenge"", a favorite of my spouse.  The producers must have sold their soul to the devil to get the ratings that show gets to keep it afloat.  "
The Mire,[deleted]
The Mire,"Cool, there will never be another show like Lost that jerks its viewers around and becomes a complete, meandering, pointless mess."
The Mire,"I'm not sure that the season length is the problem, but maybe the series length.  

If your good idea doesn't fill 20-26 episodes, it probably isn't fit for TV, or should fit in a single episode.  The problem arises when you try to stretch an interesting concept from one season over seven.  You just end up with a painfully slow plot and loose ends.  I'd rather see a good idea last for just a season than damage itself by lasting longer than its meant to.  

I'd love to see some networks try a Korean-style single season format.  Their cool show ideas don't become stale over time like Lost or BSG did.  Filler is minimal and the plot is always progressing.  "
The Mire,"It depends on what specific type of show you want though...

You can have sci fi shows with relatively normal budgets as far as props, filming locations, wardrobe and stuff like that.

Person of Interest, Sarah Connor Chronicles, X files, Continuum, Shield, Resurrection, Orphan Black, Fringe, Haven, Under the Dome, Heroes, Misfits, Flash Forward etc.

All of the above look like generic regular shows most of the time while still having science fiction stories.

Then you have science fiction shows in which they set it in some post apocalyptic setting or on a space ship or back in the past etc.

Shows like Star Trek, Battlestar, The 100, Terra Nova, Walking Dead, Farscape, Dr Who etc.

The above almost always have some sort of need to look visually different from regular run of the mill shows and can be joined by other genres like period pieces or fantasy styled shows like Game of Thrones, Ripper Street, Copper, Downton Abbey etc.

"
The Mire,"Yeah, it's not like two of the top three highest grossing movies are sci-fi/fantasy.  Or that nearly every major blockbuster of the next few years is either.  Sci-fi is totally not popular at all. "
The Mire,">Redditors are always surprised to find out they aren't a very good sample of what the general population are actually like.

I understand what you are saying, but all these shows usually start out with a bang and then sink.  That tells me that the audience is interested in the premise, but disappointed with the execution.  

The Walking Dead is a very successful sci fi show that grows its audience year after year.   True Blood has done very well.   'Lost' was a water-cooler discussion favorite.  So these shows can succeed.  

I was willing to suspend disbelief over the idea that humans could biologically function without electricity, but Revolution got so convoluted that no one seemed to know what was going on.   Just as the Resurrection concept of our departed loved ones returning to us was intriguing, but the garbled plot lines about the government coverup conspiracy was dull as watching paint dry.   

I know the 'general population' is always going to prefer the vaginal humor of Two Broke Broads or the feeling of intellectual superiority of laughing at Sheldon and his nerdy friends, but it seems the networks could offer something bolder that does not break down after the first 5 episodes.  "
The Mire,"Avatar is the highest grossing film of all time. I don't think it's because of the blue aliens or the cool mech suits. 

The shows that OP mentioned though...they aren't really good examples of quality TV. Some sci-fi/fantasy shows have been huge. But that's because they are about people first, genre elements later. After the first four episodes, I couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of the characters. And the plot was disgustingly boring. By the third episode, I was well invested in Ned Stark's hunt for the murderer behind Non Arryn. Characterization isn't just putting characters into shitty situations. It's about them reacting to it in a realistic way, and then their realization of the consequences and how they deal with them. Something that a lot of TV shows (Usually the ones that get cancelled) tend to completely ignore."
The Mire,/r/PersonOfInterest is science fiction and it is one of the most watched shows on television. It is also one of the most politically relevant science fiction shows as it predicted the NSA surveillance scandal two years prior.
The Mire,"Sci-fi is extraordinarily popular currently.... It's just too expensive to produce well for television. 

Inability to create it well does not mean it isn't very popular or in demand... It's just not as profitable as reality shows or sitcoms due to the extra overhead. 

Fuck, even teenage girls are crazy over the hunger games books and movies. That group isn't exactly known for their love of dystopian science fiction stories yet here we are.

The Mire,"That's true but there's a reason why that success in movies doesn't often translate over to television.  I think that's because it's not the genre elements of those movies that make them hits.  Huge effects-laden movies have always been popular, and sci-fi and fantasy happen to lend themselves well to the kind of large-scale spectacle that only blockbuster movies can properly execute.

If they could provite that same level of high-impact visuals, setpieces and star power on weekly sci-fi/fantasy TV shows, I think they would absolutely be more popular.  But the ones that try mostly just end up looking campy, and the ones that don't are usually too low-key or cerebral to interest a mainstream audience."
The Mire,"Ya know, I had a dream that I was dreaming about a dream where I pondered why sci fi was not more popular.  "
The Mire,"> The Walking Dead is a very successful sci fi show that grows its audience year after year. True Blood has done very well. 'Lost' was a water-cooler discussion favorite. So these shows can succeed.

The three shows you mentioned in the OP - Jericho, Resurrection, and Revolution - were all network shows.  TWD and True Blood are on cable, which has a very different financial model (one that doesn't entirely rely on ad revenue, this more forgiving for lower ratings).

Lost is kind of an exception to this. Aside from the fact the show wasn't really a sci-fi series (at least until later seasons when time travel was introduced) and was more of a mystery series, Lost was doing something no other show at the time was doing storytelling-wise. It was different, and was the big ""water cooler"" show for a bulk, if not the entirety, of it's time on air. None of that can really be said for those three aforementioned shows."
The Mire,"They're usually just executed so poorly. I personally found Revolution ridiculous, the acting cheesy, and I did not really care much for the characters.

I found the premise of Resurrection great, but it ended up being so boring. 

And I *like* sci-fi shows in general (Dollhouse, Orphan Black, BSG, etc). It is really disappointing that there aren't more sci-fi shows that are well done. I feel like there are great concepts that are taken and just ruined. "
The Mire,"I don't think the smoke monster ""resolution"" (if you can call it that) in season 5 was planned out in season 1.  I've always had the feeling that it's something they introduced, then they had no idea what to do with it.  Then season 5 came, and they felt they had to wrap up story lines."

The Mire,"If you think Lost was too smart for some people then you need smarter friends. It wasn't that smart a show... 

Though I think it handled time travel exceptionally well for a tv show. It's usually done so poorly it makes me want to scream. 

I loved Lost but was seriously disappointed in its final season because the answers were often tacked on when they could have been explained more organically. 

In fact, I would argue that Lost's failing was in the way it dumbed down its answers to placate the lower brow viewers when they could have elevated things a bit, at the expense of the lowest common denominator. Too much rushed exposition, and a finale that focused on an invented side plot to distract from the main story. The last episode, though emotionally compelling, was the exemplification of deus ex machina. "
The Mire,"I'd argue that, for the most part, scifi simply hasn't been handled well on TV.  Star Trek: TNG was a rating success and several SciFi shows have been successful, ratings aside, through netflix/hulu/amazon subscriptions and dvd sales (BSG, Stargate SG-1).  Walking Dead and Game of Thrones have been successful as well.

The biggest problem with major network scifi has been a desire for mass appeal, which simply leads to bad TV.  They want to get the scifi fans in with a more mainstream demographic, so you end up with shows like Terra Nova, which had a really cool scifi premise, but they focused on family drama too much and it just made the whole show boring.  It might as well of been full house with dinosaurs.  

Scifi is at its best when A) you're willing to spend some money on actors/effects/setting and B) you focus on the scifi elements.  You can't just have a family show with some random scifi elements.  The scifi needs to be the focus."
The Mire,"> Jericho, Resurrection, and Revolution - were all network shows.

...hence the title of my post. "
The Mire,">It is really disappointing that there aren't more sci-fi shows that are well done. I feel like there are great concepts that are taken and just ruined. 

I like quite a few sci-fi movies but dislike 90% of sci-fi TV shows, as you said they tend to be executed poorly.

I've always been curious to see what a big budget premium network like HBO could do with the genre, it sounds like they are going to give it a shot next year with a full season of ""Westworld"" and Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation"" so fingers crossed."
The Mire,"I watched Revolution's pilot & I just wasn't into. Kripke's other genre show however, Supernatural, is *still* on air & confirmed for a season 11 next fall.

The Mire,Must be the new generation of drain cleaners. 
The Mire,"Dislike of the ending is not the same as inability to understand it. It was easily understood... 

It was emotionally powerful and I appreciate the larger message, but I would have opted to forego the overreach of the afterlife and preferred to deal strictly with regular life. 

If you boil it down any story can end with all main characters going to heaven... It's potentially an option for everything. It's not meaningful within the narrative because it is simply too broad. If you don't agree I would urge you to verbally outline the plot of Lost from beginning to end. The last sentence would be ""then everyone goes to heaven""... Which I find childish and makes previous plot points less meaningful. I mean they all would have ended up in the afterlife regardless of what occurred to that point... Hugging and moving on together no matter what. So what happened was largely unimportant except as it relates to their relationships. 

All that being said I reiterate that I found the finale very emotionally charged and compelling. I enjoyed the show even if I would have made different choices with the narrative. Great acting and directing throughout.  Solid television. 
"
The Mire,"I actually disagree. 

Of course there was a drop in quality between seasons 4 and 5, but by that point, the writers had already committed to an ending and began planning for it. They easily could have gone the network TV route and changed the ending to appease the most viewers, or they could have simply stayed true to the vision they had for the ending, which wasn't perfect, but was a lot better than I actually expected (based off of the vitriol and contempt I heard so many people had for it). 

I ended up marathon-viewing the show a few years ago, so I wasn't there for the week-in week-out analysis of the show, but I never understood the hatred for the ending. Sure, it was abstract, but it was open-ended enough to allow discussion. That really fell in-line with the rest of the show, though, which had always been speculative and left the mystery of the island open-ended. 

So while I think the ending wasn't what a lot of people wanted (a definitive answer to every question they had), it was the perfect ending to the show. It answered just enough about the island and the mysteries involved, but left it open for people to interpret it as they will. Even if you go back to the earlier seasons, the show made a point to do that and carried the tradition through the finale. 

For me, at least, the mystery of the show would have been lost (pun not intended) if they had simply gone through a finale that answered questions. May this have a lot to do with Damon Lindelof's writing style? Absolutely. But I think that for the show, it was as good an ending as could have been expected throughout the rest of the show. "
The Mire,"You mentioned TNG, which I would argue isn't super SCIENCE-fiction-y. Neither are other long lasting ""scifi"" shows like BSG or Stargate. A mass audience isn't going to appreciate hard scifi (look at Interstellar), so successful genre shows always end up being drama hybrids and lose a lot of their scifi appeal in the process."
The Mire,"Then you proceed to say these types of shows can succeed, and cite cable programs. I said this before in my post, but the fact is, cable and network have very different financial models. That's the reason why these shows can work on cable but not network.

A show like True Blood, assuming it had the same ratings, would never have made it past Season 1 on a network due to the ratings (2.5 million at the highest, several shows this year have been cancelled with a similar range of figures). This ignoring any violence/sex, which would have to be toned down. And while I'm sure most networks would love the Walking Dead and its ratings, the amount of violence/gore would probably be too much to have for network shows.
"
The Mire,Draino Semen?
The Mire,"> I ended up marathon-viewing the show a few years ago, so I wasn't there for the week-in week-out analysis of the show, but I never understood the hatred for the ending.

I think that might be the issue there. I could be wrong, but I always felt that if you watch something weekly and follow it for years, you have a bit stronger of a connection/opinion to it (probably not the wisest way to word that, but the point should still get across). 
For a person who watches weekly, and has had years of hype for the finale, especially for a show like lost, may find an otherwise mediocre or unsatisfying ending (show quality is all subjective) to be terrible and anger inducing. It's all on the viewers end, sure, but they've had years to think about the show, how it might end, and form a (possibly unrealistic) level of expectation.

When you binge watch it, you may have invested the same viewing time as the weekly watcher, but you didn't necessarily have that 6 or so years of hype and weekly speculation that Lost had. Especially if you're like me, you watched several episodes a day and finished the series in two or so weeks.

I assume this is why I'm so ambivalent towards Lost's finale (a show I binge watched well after it finished), yet I despise Dexter and HIMYM's finales (two shows I followed very early on in their runs)."
The Mire,"Personally I hated the ending.  

It seemed to me that they pivoted from a story focusing on time travel (which they handled really well), to one focusing on religion.... Then ultimately on the afterlife. To me, the addition of the afterlife has a tendency to devalue prior events. Did any of it really matter at all if they all go to heaven in the end?  Just a bit of an overreach. 

Imagine if any tv series ended where all major characters meet up in heaven and essentially agree that what happened previously wasn't all that important. All is forgiven and ""let go"" of and we all go to heaven and just disregard everything we just experienced because that happened a long time ago and is now irrelevant. It cheapens the journey IMO. 

I also think they could have created more interesting answers if they stuck with the time travel theme. Causation and paradoxes could have explained a lot, but instead they went with gods and monsters and heaven. Felt like a cop out used to evoke emotional response from the audience instead of provoking deeper thought. "
The Mire,">successful genre shows always end up being drama hybrids and lose a lot of their scifi appeal in the process

No matter what genre a piece of work is though - it's got to have heart. You can only geek out over obscure details or universe mythos for so long - eventually you always come back to needing an emotional connection to the characters & what they're going through."
Exorcist,I forgot about this show. I remember now that I liked it when Genna Davis was around but not so much after that. This franchise has a lot of ups and downs and from what I can recall I'd say this series was somewhere in the middle. Below Exorcist 3 but above all the other sequels.
Exorcist,"Poor writing maybe, lol. Despite its flaws I was disappointed that this one was cancelled. I think it could have evolved into a good show, maybe with guest writers/directors. I think I read somewhere that there’s another film/remake/reimagining/re-memberberry in the offing, or being made or something."
Exorcist,"I really loved this show, had it premiered today I think it would've been bigger."
Exorcist,"“Why does the people who are possesed who meet father Marcus just not kill him? He obviously is a threath with all his knowledge.”

The show really wasn’t well designed. I thought the idea of the rich people wanting to be possessed was interesting but it should have been the focus of the show. It was developing an interesting mythology in that aspect. But a lot of the other stuff like the Reagan rehash didn’t work."

I’d never heard of it during it’s original run, but watched it on Amazon and thought it was fantastic. I definitely enjoyed the first season more than the second, but that’s not a knock on S2, which was just as fun.

I just loved how it kept the connection to the original movie."

They should have gotten the chance to wrap the story up"
Exorcist,Meh. It's no Haunting of Hill House.

Exorcist,Awesome. I have loved every performance I’ve seen of this actor. He stole the show on NBC’s live version of JC Superstar.

Exorcist,"Ben Daniels is always great. Not interested in the show but if you want more of him, check the movie Conspiracy or Law & Order UK, which is surprisingly great"
Exorcist,"YES he's the perfect Santiago.

Ben Daniels is also phenomenal in The Exorcist."
Exorcist,I loved him in The Exorcist!  This is great news
Exorcist,"Not a fan of the show. I’m a big fan of the books, but the show just doesn’t compare to what Anne did with her stories. Maybe I’d have liked the show had I never read the books."
Exorcist,"I don't understand how Interview Season 1 was so well written and executed, but Mayfair Witches was such a steaming pile of turd.

Happy for Ben Daniels, however.  He was criminally underrated in the Exorcist."
Exorcist,Gay me about died from how hard I binged this show. I need more
Exorcist,It's in my top 3 from last year. Hoping for season 2 late this year but it's probably wishful thinking..
Exorcist,"Making Louis black adds a lot to the power imbalance that Lestat has over him. Also makes for a much more interesting period drama with the organized crime aspect. I am also really loving this portrayal of Lestat, especially when compared with the movie. Funny thing is Louis seems to be emulating Brad Pitt's speech pattern and mannerisms (from the film) during the interview segments."
Exorcist,This show is great but Mayfair is terrible.  I gave up on it.
Exorcist,It's fantastic. Blew me out of the water.
Exorcist,"Fantastic acting? The main character is awful. She can't do any emotional scenes.

Edit: nvm I'm stupid thought it was about the Mayfair Witches show."
Exorcist,"Pilate is a role written with such a bizarrely large vocal range that most of the time you don’t get an actor who can sing the whole part well “as written.” This has led to frequently casting actors over singers, who speak sing huge portions of the role. 

So all things considered, Daniels was one of the best acted Pilates I’ve seen, even though (like many) he couldn’t really sing it well."
Exorcist,"I read the books and actually really like all the changes here. Making Louis black adds a lot of interesting avenues for exploring the past, and adds to the power imbalance that comes naturally with an elder Vampire like Lestat. Aging Claudia up was also the right choice, as well as not having her be a romantic interest for Louis (gross, she's like 8 in the books). Lestat here also seems to be very close to the books, maybe a bit more effeminate, but he is french.

What did you not like about it?"
Exorcist,"The biggest flaws i could see was the casting,acting and writing,all important factors for the success of a show.
Rowan and Lasher had no chemistry at all. Lasher is supposed to be this seductive and mysterious entity that Rowan keeps coming back too but instead he gave me 'used car salesman' vibe and Daddario's acting was monotonous, the dialogue delivery flat and it doesn't help that the dialogue itself is dull af


On the other hand Sam Reid and Jacob Anderson's chemistry and acting was INSANE!!! they are the heart of this show and Sam is literally posessed by Lestat,he is that good"
Exorcist,Yep. They really fucked up Mayfair. Combining Rowan’s mentor and love interest was one of the bigger mistakes.
Exorcist,Dear God Mayfair Witches is terrible.
Exorcist,"I don't think they share any writers or showrunners, do they? Basically separate shows, loosely connected by the books."
Exorcist,They're talking about interview with the vampire
Exorcist,"Honestly, my opinion of Alexandra Daddario as an actor plummeted after watching this show and I did watch the whole thing. I wouldn’t say I was a fan but I guess her other projects concealed her limitations. This was a lot to work with and she didn’t deliver much at all."
Exorcist,"Her acting is brutal. The Lasher character is horrendous.  The chemistry is lousy.  The writing is sub-par.    It probably comes down to money, but to put out a great product in Interview, and then shit all over Mayfair (the first book is terrific) is mind-numbing."
Exorcist,I only watched the first two episodes of the Witches before giving it a rest. I truly don’t understand how they managed to make it look so lifeless and like a mash up of the blandest ‘prestige’ dramas of 2013
Exorcist,Uhh i guess I'm just dumb. My excuse is I had just woken up.
Exorcist,"Exactly! The other projects of hers that i've watched is True detective and the white lotus and both the characters she played weren't that deep or didnt demand a strong presence in the show

Rowan is supposed to be this immensely powerful witch and a woman who is discovering her sexual appetite, instead they made her this whiny damsel in distress,monotonous shell of a person. Being the 13th witch is a big deal but I was more invested in Dierdre Mayfair's story than Rowan's

It's such a sad thing coz the book readers kept saying the source material was amazing and abundant and they butchered it mercilessly. I watched it for the sake of the crossover which never happened lmao and now they are pushing that show for an Emmy? Good luck Esta and Michelle.

I feel along with the acting and plot as such,the showrunners themselves are so disconnected from the source material and aren't as passionate unlike their IWTV counterparts where Sam Reid and Rolin Jones have been long time Anne Rice fans and even with the changes managed to keep the emotional arcs of the characters intact. Sam was described by one of the producers on set as 'the most knowledgeable person about TVC out of everyone on set' and Mayfair lacked someone like this. Daddario was the only one of the mains who read the first book"
Exorcist,"I thought her weird halting line delivery came from being traumatised at the start of the season. But no, she was doing it until the very end. Very weird acting choice."
Exorcist,"I never read the source material. I gave it so much grace because IWTV was one of the best things I’ve seen in years. I stuck with it for that and because the side characters are actually pretty good.

But god, Daddario just feels like a dead fish the whole time while her character goes through so much. The arc is major but she just seems like a person who has things happen to her and never does anything herself. Even though I think the Lasher actor is miscast and the chemistry is non-existent, he’s at least performing at a high level acting-wise.

I’m probably still going to watch season 2 in the hopes of a turnaround because it’s not out of the realm of possibilities. But I don’t think I’ll stick through another entire season if it doesn’t make some hits early."
Exorcist,"Yes! I watched it on Netflix and really enjoyed series. It definitely worth watching. Good characters, and some scary moments. It’s also nice that even though it was cancelled early,  the main plot of each season wraps up well, it’s only the B plot that has no resolution."
Exorcist,"You know it's crazy, I remember watching this, and I remember enjoying it, but now I honestly couldn't tell you one thing about this series. Neither the premise, plot or characters... I can't recall a thing about it. 

So it was good, but in hindsight... forgettable?"
Exorcist,"Right up there with *Hannibal* on NBC.

What both these shows did right was they didn't attempt to make a generally appealing ""network show"" whatsoever. They made a horror program for the genre's audience. It's doomed to be niche, sure, but at least they took the risk."
Exorcist,John Cho did SUCH a great job on this show! I wish it had kept going
Exorcist,"I was watching the first episode, then all of a sudden I heard a baby crying on the side of my house which is next to the alley. Its really dark with no lights out, so I took a flashlight outside and went to the side of the house. It was two cats making love on my fence. It freaked me out. I threw a lemon at them from my tree and decide I'm not going to watch the series."
Exorcist,I loved this show! It was one of the shows I looked forward to watching each week. Still mad it got cancelled.
Exorcist,"I ended up watching this on Amazon a couple of years ago and found it to be the best Exorcist related movie/show, aside from the original movie.

I thought Season 1 was a little better than Season 2 if only because it had that past history to go off of and season 2 I thought started a bit slow, but picked up steam brilliantly. It’s a shame it was cancelled."
Exorcist,"Fun fact, my friend played Stacy in season 2.

We used to work at Cineplex together, and now we individually work in film."
Exorcist,"> better that it had right to be

Don't do this."
Exorcist,Why didn't it have any right being good?
Exorcist,Wish shows like these were more accessible to watch once done airing!
Exorcist,"Such a great horror series. It had a great plot and storyline, great acting, the only thing it was missing was the audience. I was super bummed that they cancelled it."
Exorcist,"YES!!! Completely underrated, exceptional show. One of the ones I’m most sad isn’t continuing. I loved it!"
Exorcist,"agreed, shame it was canceled"
Exorcist,"Damn, I just finished the two seasons in less than a week and I'm really heartbroken, that it won't continue! It had everything in place to become a great third season"
Exorcist,"What is it with Reddit posts like this? Like you could post this garbage for anything, like I just thought of a random shitty franchise and I thought of the Beethoven series. I could post “The ‘Beethoven’ series was way better than it had any right to be. Even the direct-to-video sequels weren’t excellent, especially for family entertainment.” and I’d probably get at least a few dozen upvotes. 

The second movie with Gary Busey was great. The third one with Don Swayze really made me think and by the time it was over I had forgotten that Patrick Swayze was a human being who existed on this earth, his performance was so mesmerizing. It’s right up there with The Godfather series in terms of earth-shattering works of popular entertainment."
Exorcist,"I'd seen this opinion shared a number of times and it eventually got me to watch the first season.

My overriding feeling was that it shared little with the film and got progressively sillier as it went on. I did finish the whole season though so it's certainly not bad.

I felt the twist, or perhaps reveal is a better word, to tie it in with the film was poorly written and unnecessary. The series also carried none of the weight of the film and lacked the introspection to discuss a topic such as faith, or the losing of it.

I'd be interested to know whether it originally started out as a tie-in or whether the studio realised attaching The Exorcist name to it was a useful way to gain more publicity. Fair play to them, it was certainly a factor in getting me to watch.

The positives for me were Herrera and Daniels were charismatic leads, most of the effects work was good, the Brother Simon character was enjoyably villainous, and the way they personified the demon, along with the actor portraying it, was quite creepy.

I'd be wary of recommending it to people as anything other than a decent horror series, particularly if they're big fans of the film."
Exorcist,Nah
Exorcist,It was a terrible show what are you talking about
Exorcist,I watch the first episode time to time for the end scene.
Exorcist,I agree with you as far as the first season goes.
Exorcist,"That particular plot twist/reveal in season 1 was pretty god damn insane and bold, took me completely by surprise. It was a very good series, sadly we never got a decent closure. The Exorcist tv series is like a worst idea ever, but this was actually surprisingly good."
Exorcist,I only remember the priests gaining powers and it was funny watching them fight
Exorcist,"The first season was really great. The second season started off really great, and then became really generic post-twist."
Exorcist,Watch Evil on Paramount+.  I think it's vastly superior.  Season two is darker now that it went streaming only.  Just renewed for a third season!
Exorcist,So it is worth watching now?
Exorcist,I really loved the priest characters (the veteran one who was kind of on the outs with the church) and the new-to-this-stuff rookie. The whole plot and way it all connected to the church was really interesting. I enjoyed that the two seasons were different stories/settings and I remember great performances from Geena Davis in the first season and in season two John Cho and Brianna Hildebrand were great.  Really enjoyed the series but I also forgot about a handful of things and was just reminded of them when thinking about the show.
Exorcist,I just had the exact same reaction when i read this post.  I think I was obsessed with it but I'm gonna have to watch a trailer and maybe do a re-watch if it's warranted.
Exorcist,This is an inspiring story.
Exorcist,But you need to use a pretentious headline to grab peoples attention!
Exorcist,Because I guess that makes for a more interesting headline?
Exorcist,"This franchise has a reputation for being run into the ground. Until this show, nothing had come even close to matching the quality of the original."
Exorcist,Because most of the sequels sucked except the one that was basically a completely different story that used a few of the same characters and settings
Exorcist,Both seasons are on Hulu in the U.S.
Exorcist,"Well, I'm someone who saw this post and had never heard of this series and now it's on my watch list.

You're on a public forum where people talk about television.  You should probably get used to it, or unsubscribe."
Exorcist,"Yes. It's an open-ended, ""and then they kept fighting evil"" kinda thing."
Exorcist,I would rather qualify it as obnoxious.
Exorcist,Well said.
Exorcist,"Okay thank you, I will give it a try."
Exorcist,Of course they are more complex. Most are like a 100+ hour long movie
Exorcist,There are tons of character driven films released every year. Not everything is a superhero move/blockbuster hopeful. There's also tons of trash on TV. It's unfair to compare the best TV shows with all movies released.
Exorcist,"If you like Friedkin's work, and haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and find a copy of Sorcerer and watch it. It's insanely awesome. "
Exorcist,"In other news, the sky remains a blue-ish color scientists are hesitantly calling ""blue"", and rain still falls downward. "
Exorcist,"Preliminary PR work, since he might be involved with True Detective season 2 :)"
Exorcist,"ITT: People who don't know who William Friedkin is. 

This story isn't notable because he's breaking the news that TV shows are more complex, it's notable because one of the greatest and most prolific living film directors is saying that television is a more thriving art form than film these days and considering working in the medium. That's big fucking news. I'm on pins and needles imagining what Friedkin would bring to a cable drama."

The Witcher,Cancellation
The Witcher,Poorly?
The Witcher,By fading into the background and getting cancelled after season 3 because no one wants to continue watching this series without Henry Cavill as Geralt?
The Witcher,Without the man? Show’s already ended bud.
The Witcher,In flames?
The Witcher,I mean... Between the books and the games it'd be pretty concerning if she didn't.
The Witcher,Aren't there fucking books which... *Checks notes* End???
The Witcher,"We all do.

Without an audience and cancelled before ultimately being forgotten."
The Witcher,"Well, yes, that's part of her job."
The Witcher,Why the fuck would you work on a witcher TV series if you hate the source ? The fuck is wrong with these people
The Witcher,Utter disappointment?
The Witcher,"I know how the series will end too, with a cancellation."
The Witcher,Yeah… canceled
The Witcher,With viewers losing interest in a new Geralt and shitty writing that goes too far from the source material?
The Witcher,"She is going to wrap it up quick, so she can work on Star Wars."
The Witcher,"She has the source material, this shouldn’t be hard.  Why can’t this person just do the right thing.  Just adapt the fucking books.  Stop doing anything outside of that."
The Witcher,I don’t think I’ll ever know how it ends and I’m fine with that
The Witcher,With Henry Cavill leaving the show?
The Witcher,"This new ""Witcher"" spinoff is like it was written by an AI tasked with casting a wide a net as possible to touch every single demographic and generic plot line they can squeeze in. I couldn't count how many things they introduced within 15 mins before I ran for my life.

Netflix needs to clean house because even Henry couldn't carry these idiot writers and showrunners. I am glad he's moving on holy shit."
The Witcher,"You mean she read the books (or at least the final chapter) her job it is to adapt?

Or she got to the game ending or watched youtube clips?

But more than that, as a writer I can say, literally anyone who has ever written anything knows where the story will end on a meta level

If you've ever attempted to write a book, chances are you had your ending mapped out anywhere between 30-70% completion and then you're just working your way over there

Go watch any interview with any critically acclaimed writer and they will say the same thing"
The Witcher,"“The person who leads the entire production of a series knows how said series will conclude.”

I’m absolutely shocked I tell you! **Shocked!**"
The Witcher,With cancellation after you replaced Henry Cavill!
The Witcher,“undeniably become a smash hit for Netflix..” lmao Collider is such absolute shit.
The Witcher,"To shreds, you say?"
The Witcher,It's crazy how unqualified some people are for their jobs.
The Witcher,"No shit Sherlock, you’re the writer."
The Witcher,Canceled? I'm betting it ends by being canceled.
The Witcher,"With season 3, would be my guess. Who's going to watch *Liam Hemsworth* in the lead role? What a joke."
The Witcher,"Considering her show is based on a finished property, *everyone* should know how it ends. But it seems the writers on fantasy adaptations would rather just use known characters to trick people into watching their bad fanfics."
The Witcher,"Me too, with very low ratings"
The Witcher,With the show being cancelled & her losing her job?
The Witcher,Cancelled
The Witcher,"Since s3 is mostly done, I figured…"
The Witcher,"I’m pretty sure we all know. It ends with season 3 lol. I’ll give her credit where it’s due, I can see myself in Henry Cavill in this show. Finally I can see myself in a show, I can see the sad gamer and fan having to experience first hand something he loves be ruined."
The Witcher,We all know how it will end... With no one watching it anymore
The Witcher,"So do I: with Netflix canceling it, unfinished."
The Witcher,"This. This right here is why she struggles. 

“books that are like Blood of Elves, which Season 2 sort of loosely was based around. It didn't have enough action to keep us going, so we ended up having to bring parts of Baptism of Fire into it.”"
The Witcher,Me too....cancelled.
The Witcher,Book readers should know too but I suppose that’s why Cavill left
The Witcher,This next season will be dead on arrival. and it will end on a cliffhanger then netflix will cancel it due to poor viewership. That's how it will end
The Witcher,Cancelled by netflix. Yeah we all know at this point.
The Witcher,"Yes, we know too. Abruptly, next year lolol"
The Witcher,"The writers of ""Lost"" maintained for years there was a reason behind the events on the island, and they knew the ending and were writing towars that. 

All poppycock, they were as lost as we were and in the end, the only ending they could come up with was the equivalent of ""and it was all a dream"" 

The producers/showrunners will say anything"
The Witcher,Charge her with premeditated murder at this point
The Witcher,I've always heard the expression 'dumpster fire' being used and never expect to experience it until now.
The Witcher,"If she is the only one that knows that, it’s going to be far from the source material."
The Witcher,"So do I, after Henry Cavill is gone it’s over for me"
The Witcher,Wouldn’t be surprised if the show gets cancelled before Liam Hemsworth even takes over. And to be honest I hope that is what happens. This adaptation is creatively bankrupt.
The Witcher,"Big woop? So do I. It ended when they went completely off the rails, and Henry Cavill left."
The Witcher,"By being cancelled due to poor ratings related to bad writing? Yeah, we know too..."
The Witcher,"So do I, when Henry Cavill leaves"
The Witcher,All men die from a virus and women are immortal?
The Witcher,She is watching the door
The Witcher,Me too… with no one watching
The Witcher,Me too.  Cancelled.
The Witcher,"by cancelation, probably"
The Witcher,Yeah it already did when henry cavill left
The Witcher,They should end it after season 3… no need to continue once Cavill is gone.
The Witcher,I do too. It will end with a mass exodus of viewers abandoning the show with Henry Cavill.
The Witcher,"At the end of season 3, because nobody's gonna watch season 4."
The Witcher,It ended with henry leaving
The Witcher,"I personally can’t wait for Geralt to drink the Witcher version of polyjuice potion to explain the change and back it up with, “Now you can travel freely again with your new face” or something like that. If they change it from a Geralt story to focusing on another Witcher, cool….but I don’t see it happening.

What I do see is a huge viewership for the first two episodes with Hemsworth and then a steep drop into cancellation unless he blows us all away."
The Witcher,"Cancellation, because Cavill carried the show ?"
The Witcher,“Henry will leave and nobody will watch anymore”
The Witcher,Hopefully be being cancelled
The Witcher,By that bitch letting go of cavill. I’m not watching shit else she’s making. She fucked up
The Witcher,With Cavil not in it?
The Witcher,With Henry Cavill leaving.
The Witcher,"I think we all know :)   


Canceled after season 4"
The Witcher,Series will at season 3. No one gives a shit after Cavil.
The Witcher,Imagine writing this article. Journalists are all shills these days
The Witcher,I don't get why she has a job
The Witcher,"we all do. It ended before it started, when she was hired to be precise"
The Witcher,Me too! Abruptly after the 3rd season
The Witcher,"That implies that the show will end at all. Poorly, mind you, but just not a straight-up cancellation

Which is surprising to me"
The Witcher,"Yes without Cavill,..that's all I need to know.

Not only he is awesome in Geralt's portrayal but he tried to keep the showrunners more respectful of the original material.  


I'm watching season 3 because Cavill is in it, season 4 probably not unless the user feedbacks are dithyrambic,..I just don't think they will be"
The Witcher,"If Henry Cavill's ""perfect send-off"" as Geralt isn't a threesome with Triss and Yen idk what they'll do"
The Witcher,"Yeah we know it end with the last cast change buddy. Watch your numbers dip abysmally from season 3 to 4, no hate to Liam Hemsworth but he only will have one season (less if Netflix pull out the cancel card)"
The Witcher,Didn’t even bother with the spin-off I too can predict how it will end.
The Witcher,Probably canceled after season 3
The Witcher,It already has.
The Witcher,"That's a pretty long winded way of saying ""A smoking pile of ruin, after giving into the whims of a roomful of hack writers who should have stuck with fan fiction."""
The Witcher,We all do. With Henry Cavill leaving.
The Witcher,I know too: hopefully in cancelation
The Witcher,Crashed and burning at her feet?
The Witcher,In a Disaster?
The Witcher,"Yeah being hated by fans, we know."
The Witcher,"“Wait… Wait, I know this one.  It’s… Badly.  It will end badly.”"
The Witcher,Me too. First week of season 4 when they realize they killed the show when they lost Cavill. Hey look I can see the future
The Witcher,We do too. It ends after season 3 when Cavil leaves.
The Witcher,It ends with being canceled by Netflix
The Witcher,"Soon, hopefully."
The Witcher,"Hopefully cancellation.

I've read the books and played the games and she's treating her source material like toilet paper."
The Witcher,Spoiler: In cancellation.
The Witcher,In a cancelation 🤣
The Witcher,….we do too: cancelled.
The Witcher,The only answer that matters is: nothing like the books.
The Witcher,But it already ended.
The Witcher,Has anyone watched the new spin-off? Blood Origin?
Agent,Why am I just now hearing about this? I can’t wait to check it out this weekend.
Agent,This looks fun. And the animation style seems to be a pleasant departure from the Netflix standard.
Agent,This feels like something that would have come out a decade ago. Well besides the whole Matthew McConaughey part. Seems like a fun show so I might give it a watch.
Agent,"Only watched 2 episodes, till now it feels kind of all style no substance. The show looks good as hell and i think the transitions and multi-panel shots are especially cool. Animation and sound team seem to have really nailed it. Haven't found it all that funny tho and the plot is certainly weird but also kinda unengaging imo. Might get better tho, also McConaughey is pretty cool as Elvis i guess"
Agent,r/AgentElvis
Agent,"Was really looking forward to this. But after the 2 episodes .. it could be better.

Animation etc brilliant.

They forgot the story.  Archer this is not.  You have to wait a long time for the humor and when it does arrive its not a big payoff."
Agent,"I hadn't heard about, this is showed up in my feed this morning and binged the whole thing.  LOVE IT!"
Agent,"Yeah , I enjoyed it , I'd like if it got another season to finish off , but could go either way."
Agent,I didn't like a single joke in the trailer I saw for it
Agent,Matthew McConaughey in a show voicing Elvis and this is the first I'm hearing of? Netflix promotion is terrible. Need a crossover with Austin Butler for sure
Agent,It’s just gonna get canceled after one season like everything else funny Netflix makes.
Agent,Ok but who is this shows target audience?
Agent,Is he a nonce groomer like the real Elvis was?
Agent,Wasn’t this Elvis guy obsessed with 14 year old girls and their virginity?
Agent,Is it more cowboy bebop or space dandy?
Agent,I enjoyed it even though it feels like a version of an adult swim series that people forgot ages ago. It mostly made me miss inside job because it has some moments reminiscent. It’s going to be very definitively canceled though which sucks.
Agent,"Premise of the show makes it sound like a Nic Cage vehicle, not McConaughey."
Agent,Ugliest animation I have seen that is designed by the great Robert Valley.... Shame on you titmouse.
Agent,could've really done without the monkey
Agent,Same. Netflix doesn’t seem to want to spend their money on PR.
Agent,"They really nail inventive transitions. Initially it looked bit close to Archer, but it's way more dynamic and stylized."
Agent,i hope hbo continues the grindelwald story with an animated series with this art style
Agent,Plot seems like its from the Adult Swim era where they weren't afraid to get weird with it.
Agent,I don’t like a single episode and I’m 3 episodes deep.
Agent,You’re right but let’s support it anyway
Agent,"Netflix is such a graveyard.  I won’t ever check out their shows even if they’re supposed to be great until they’re over, been burned way too many times"
Agent,There's the algorithm to force them to not cancel. Force them to not make anything at all. Brilliant.
Agent,https://www.theonion.com/man-always-gets-little-rush-out-of-telling-people-john-1819578998
Agent,Space dandy
Agent,"I knew about it because they dropped trailers a month and two weeks ago.  Elvis's YouTube channel also put up a side by side performance of real Elvis and animated Elvis.  They had a premiere last week, a banner on Netflix, social media from Netflix.  There are all of these reviews and interviews with the creators.  I don't know what more you could want.  Advertising on linear TV? Because I also saw a short hit during the Oscars."
Agent,"“Well, nobody watched this show they never heard about. Better cancel it before it gets popular!”"
Agent,Huh? I’ve seen a shit ton of promo for this. Do you expect them to personally come over to your house and knock on your door?!
Agent,"They don’t have to; the only people who lose out on Netflix not playing the couch and water bottle game are the promoters and journalists who need content to attract eyeballs

They just don’t specifically target this sub with advertising like HBO and Lionsgate"
Agent,reminds me of moonbeam city that was cancelled after a season
Agent,Reminds me a bit of The Venture Bros. Ps. One of the showrunners (also main writer) for Agent Elvis worked on Archer.
Agent,I miss that shit
Agent,"What the fuck is this new thing where people are so afraid that a show might get cancelled.

You know, Twin Peaks and Arrested Development were both cancelled. I guess those shows weren't worth watching until they made the revivals.

Freaks and Geeks was cancelled with a cliffhanger and never brought back so I suppose it's not worth watching at all."
Agent,"Well then good shows will continue to be cancelled because you and a bunch of others won’t even watch them, then y’all will complain about them being cancelled even tho you didn’t bother to watch them"
Agent,Same. Unfortunately all they need are one or two good ongoing shows like Stranger things to keep people subscribed.
Agent,I don’t see John Lennon getting animated shows and movies made about him. Why does Elvis seemingly get a pass? I’m genuinely curious. Please explain it to me instead of downvoting me for no reason
Agent,Thank you
Agent,Silly me for not proactively checking the Elvis YouTube channel
Agent,They want more astroturfed threads sponsored by Netflix marketing.
Agent,🤡
Agent,"A pass at *what?*

You know he's dead, right? The *real* Elvis isn't getting work."
Agent,"There was just a massively popular Beatles limited series where John Lennon was once again worshipped for his musical prowess by the general public.

This show was co-created and produced by the ""14 year old girl"" you mentioned above."
Agent,They told you about five other ways it was promoted….
Agent,He’s still getting glorified in the media with movies and animated shows as if he did nothing wrong
Agent,Yeah I mean I never saw it advertised on my Netflix and definitely haven't seen any interviews
Agent,So what? He’s dead. He’s not benefiting personally from this.
Agent,also you must not have watched the movie because he isn’t exactly portrayed in the best light lol
Agent,"I did watch the movie, his portrayal is still sanitised. It doesn't sufficiently cover how much of a groomer and abusive partner he was.



Elvis is definitely more glorified than he is demonised by far."
Agent,"The original Chilean ""documentary"" was nominated for an Oscar and it's absolutely brilliant."
Agent,"Alright! I have to admit this sounds a pretty interesting premise, and with Schur and Danson I have a feeling it will be a hit."
Agent,Add Jason Schwartzman and Zach Galifianakis and just make this a continuation of Bored to Death.
Agent,Ted Danson and Michael Shur just feel like it has to be on NBC
Agent,Not bad for an intern.
Agent,I’ll watch anything Schur makes. He’s banked so much goodwill that I’m excited for this despite it being a Netflix property
Agent,is the main character gonna be called sam moleswell?
Agent,Schur and Danson? Sign me up please.
Agent,"...okay, I'm interested"
Agent,Just wish it wasn’t Netflix. I like my sitcoms to have more than 8 episodes a season.
Agent,I am 100% onboard with that
Agent,"Oh man, I need to watch the original, they say it's beautiful."
Agent,Who taught Mose sex?
Agent,"Had to read the article, but Mike Schur is actually writing this.  They aren't just putting his name on it for extra traction.  Im down.  That guy has written some of my favorite shows."
Agent,Netflix will cancel it after one season so that's a big pass from me.
Agent,"I looked up the documentary and it says it's 'docufiction', what does that mean?"
Agent,What is known for sure - jazz is going to be insulted in some way.
Agent,Isn't it actually a documentary?
Agent,Michael's new twist on his human life.
Agent,Well this is a Universal Television production. It's likely that either NBC and Peacock passed on it or Netflix just offered more money.
Agent,"really cool to see how he’s grown in his time at meadowlark, i think he has potential"
Agent,I’m assuming the main character lives in Sacramento and is investigating why the Miami Heat suck so much as an organization and are ruining the NBA.
Agent,"Agreed. While Rutherford Falls didn't hit for me, it was still pretty decent. And if THAT is his stumble? Then bring it on.

P&R and Good Place are incredible."
Agent,Sam Moleone ^^^^(Malone)
Agent,Lance Manion
Agent,Epic joke Elon!
Agent,"It really reads plot-wise more as a movie or mini-series to me anyway.

So because of that, it's a big pass from me also."
Agent,"I watched the original. The main character is hired to live in a retirement home for a few weeks to check up on a particular resident. I didn't read anything about it, but I remember he actually had a cameraman and sound technician following him around recording him a lot of the time. 

So the residents and staff would have known what was going on, and I guess would have been instructed to just act as natural as possible."
Agent,"It's as staged as a film can be and still qualify as a documentary. I don't have a problem with it being labeled a documentary, but I wouldn't want to suggest it to people without qualifying that it's not what a lot of people think of when they hear the term."
Agent,"Yea, Schur is signed with NBCUniversal, all of his projects are gonna be Universal Television projects."
Agent,We got this but not a sequel to Bubba Ho-Tep? Lame.
Agent,"A series about Elvis being a secret government agent?

This is right up there with that movie where Abraham Lincoln was a vampire hunter, or that movie where Hansel and Gretel were witch hunter mercenaries"
Agent,"Who is this show for? Animated shows skew young and Elvis fans are…well, not so young."
Agent,"If the animation is good, I could be down w this."
Agent,There better be a beaver joke
Agent,Johnny Bravo?
Agent,"There's money for this, but not to bring back Mike Tyson Mysteries? People need to get their priorities straight."
Agent,I absolutely fucking hate the existence of this
Agent,I.... Why?
Agent,Is he a nonce in this?
Agent,"There's actually an official prequel novel and comic written by Joe R. Lansdale entitled *Bubba Ho-Tep and The Cosmic Bloodsuckers*, and then there's a official crossover comic sequel (to both the movie, the original novel, and the prequel comic) with Ash from Army of Darkness."
Agent,Only slightly believable if you’ve read any account of when Elvis met Nixon.
Agent,"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was a bad movie, but it was actually based upon a book of the same name. The book was awesome, and was also astoundingly well researched for such a silly concept. Like, take out all the mention of vampires and it would work as a pretty decent biography of Lincoln."
Agent,The article says it's for adults. The cast looks interesting for sure. I'm not sure about Matthew McConaughey as Elvis though lol. [Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iLKq_5lyw) It looks dumb but possibly in a good way. Elvis is before my time but I'll check out at least the first episode.
Agent,"I just found out about this and I think it looks like a lot of fun, so I guess me"
Agent,"I don’t get this comment. Why would an Elvis show not be interesting to a younger audience. I mean it’s an obvious choice, but he’s an interesting personality and rock music has been popular with gen z, to a certain extent. I mean Stranger Things on paper would be more interesting for people that grew up in the 80s and now it is one of the biggest shows ever."
Agent,"Kids will generally watch any show or movie thats marketed to them whether or not they have any reverence or association with the *theme*. 

All it takes is one successful piece of marketing or a friend mentioning it and a kid will watch it"
Agent,"Well, the movie was popular and everyone thought no one would see it because Elvis apparently “isn’t culturally relevant anymore”"

Twice Upon A Time,Definitely one of my favorite scenes in the show.
Twice Upon A Time,"I wish I loved this scene like so many others seem to. It just felt off to me. Probably a personal thing, I know it worked for many fans.

Edit: I knew this would attract downvotes despite specifying that it’s a personal reaction and not a judgement on the quality of the scene."
Twice Upon A Time,Agreed. Knowing for a fact Clara finally died was heart-warming.
Twice Upon A Time,[removed]
Twice Upon A Time,Is that First Doctor the dude who played William Hartnell in the Hartnell TV movie? 
Twice Upon A Time,This looks *really* cinematic. I'm incredibly excited and hope that the ratings are huge. 
Twice Upon A Time,"Why oh why do they keep bringing dead/departed companions back every chance they can? It's getting to ""Bucky is dead, oh no he's back alive"" comic book absurdity.  

Clara was one shotted by the Raven. Then came back and gets to fly around in a diner. Bill got destroyed as a Cyberman and then turned into a ghost. She shouldn't be back in any way shape or form except maybe a flashback.

When they keep bringing dead characters it starts to devalue what they died for and cheapens them as a character if they can just keep brushing off death like it's a bee sting.

Other than that it was a decent trailer. Still looking forward to it. 

David Bradley is quite significant for me in that he really brought an incredible emotional depth to the recreation of William Hartnell's experiences on the Doctor Who set. In the closing scene when Hartnell said his final goodbyes to the TARDIS set in An Adventure in Space and Time, I was tearing up. I am so glad he's reprising his Hartnell's Doctor for the special."
Twice Upon A Time,Hopefully this will be a fitting end to my favorite Doctor!
Twice Upon A Time,"I'm not ready to say goodbye to Capaldi. And Bill, actually. I feel ripped off that we only get her for one series.

I would have loved to see Capaldi with another showrunner. How he never got decorated with awards for the Heaven Sent episode, or that Zygon episode with the amazing monologue, I'll never know.

I can't wait to see what he does next with Iannucci."
Twice Upon A Time,"I thought, for a second, this was a trailer for a re-release of the [1983 animated movie of the same name] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice_Upon_a_Time_(1983_film).

But this was still great!"
Twice Upon A Time,"Man, I really wish they didn't show that regeneration snippet at the end. They spoil so much with their trailers, if they didn't announce that John Simm was appearing and the Mondasian Cybermen were returning in Series 10 well in advance it would've made for a much more impactful reveal come the finale. "
Twice Upon A Time,Finally the Moffat has gone.
Twice Upon A Time,"Capaldi, time to go buddy. See ya."
Twice Upon A Time,These regeneration sequences just get worse and worse...
Twice Upon A Time,"""I'll always remember when the Doctor was me"""
Twice Upon A Time,[removed]
Twice Upon A Time,"Yep David Bradley. You may recognize him as Argus Filch, the grumpy janitor from the Harry Potter films."
Twice Upon A Time,Yep!
Twice Upon A Time,"there's a new show runner coming aboard, they're just giving the character a decent send off like when they revisited all the companions before RTD left the show. 

Doctor Who does stuff like that in every episode though, ""oh this character is 'dead' can't wait to see how the Doctor says 'no they're not bc X'"" It's not really a show that deals in absolutes. "
Twice Upon A Time,"I understand the beef with bringing back Bill, but Clara's death and resurrection were integral parts of closing out the Doctor's story arc for the season.

And even with Bill, I don't mind that she's getting brought back. It was clear from the get go she would be a one-season companion. I just wish Moffat had been able to know ahead of time he'd want her back for the Christmas special and, yeah, not killed her only to immediately have her return."
Twice Upon A Time,"I think the problem is the nu-Who aversion to killing companions. River survives *in a way,* Clara never *has* to have the Time Lords put her back, Bill traverses space with puddle girl, Rose has her AU, Jack is immortal. Adric is the only long-term companion who has died and not gotten better."
Twice Upon A Time,"At a certain point you’re going to have to accept that that is just the sort of show Doctor Who is. The canon is always flexible, and dead people do come back on the regular."
Twice Upon A Time,Bill never died though
Twice Upon A Time,"Yeah, that was a bridge too far. Man, imagine if they hadn't spoiled Simm at all and you're watching that scene fresh when he says ""it took me a while to work out who you were"" and the penny's in the air."
Twice Upon A Time,"Is the Moffat hate even justified at this point? Seasons 6-8 were all rocky, but not unwatchable. Seasons five, nine, and ten have brought the show to new heights in quality. Moffat was responsible for Heaven Sent, which is arguably the best episode of the whole show, and after a bit of a false start, Capaldi has really shined under Moffat's guidance. 

Yeah, it's a shame Moffat wasn't able to bring his A-Game for a fair portion of his tenure, but he really wasn't all that bad. I think I'm gonna miss him when all is said and done."
Twice Upon A Time,"Fuck Moffat and fuck the current fanbase that is calling Capaldi and season 8-10 the best.

The past four years were just shit."
Twice Upon A Time,"Eleven's was very different from how Nine and Ten regenerated. We don't know what leads up to the regeneration. Moff is a better episodic writer than RTD (even if he's shit at arcs), so I imagine it won't be as maudlin or mopey as Ten's farewell."
Twice Upon A Time,[removed]
Twice Upon A Time,"try not to cry 

try not to cry 

cry a lot "
Twice Upon A Time,That one will always be both the best and the worst.
Twice Upon A Time,Tenant was best doctor. Nobody compares.
Twice Upon A Time,FUCK that gets me every fucking time.
Twice Upon A Time,"Or from the Doctor Who episode ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"""
Twice Upon A Time,"Never actually seen Harry Potter :/

But he was in Broadchurch and Game of Thrones; loved him as Hartnell though, looking forward to this "
Twice Upon A Time,Except Adric. And Katarina. Because screw them.
Twice Upon A Time,"She's only been in the show for one season. Turning into a random water god thing with her one-off girlfriend was more than sendoff enough, I'd think."
Twice Upon A Time,"> but Clara's death and resurrection were integral parts of closing out the Doctor's story arc for the season.

I'll give you that, but it does highlight an issue about not letting characters have definitive endings. A better ending for Clara would have been to have her definitively die after the Doctor allowed her to go back to the point when the Raven gets her, considering he erases her from his mind anyway."
Twice Upon A Time,"Well, if too many companions die, you develop a Batman/Robin dynamic where everyone starts considering how irresponsible it is to take unexperienced people on mortally dangerous adventures."
Twice Upon A Time,Every character needs to have a way to appear in the audiodramas indefinitely.
Twice Upon A Time,We have to keep in mind that this is a kids show after all. 
Twice Upon A Time,"Mm, I don't know what the general concensus on it was but I recognised him *the second* he appeared on screen. It was so obvious to me, but I think that was only down to me knowing he was going to show up somewhere. Idk, from what I hear with the whole #DWSR thing that went down recently, Chibnall is really locking down production sets as far as security goes as to avoid leaks etc. A step in the right direction for sure.  "
Twice Upon A Time,"Agreed. In my opinion, the show is much stronger than it was in the RTD era. The only season of Moffat's that I didn't like was 7, and that was understandable, seeing as he was preparing for the 50th at the same time. "
Twice Upon A Time,"Heaven Sent was fantastic. Practically a one man show too, it's basically all Capaldi from beginning to end. Really showed just how great an actor he is.

For a while I was under the impression that RTD was the superior showrunner, but then I binge watched the whole revived series with a friend who had never seen it. There were a lot of clunkers in those first 4.5 seasons. I would say that RTD came up with better, more theatrical season-long storylines. They usually came to a head nicely and felt big and satisfying at the time, but there were fewer good individual episodes along the way (and the best ones were usually Moffat's). He was also way too fond of the reset button. How many times were the Daleks gone for real this time, we swear, oops, more Daleks?

Moffat's run was more checkered. He was great with high concept sci-fi ideas that you could build a whole series around, like ""what if all of human history we were being manipulated by aliens we can't remember as soon as we look away"" or ""what if the concept of the afterlife exists because of the actions of one being preserving the consciousnesses of the dead for a sinister plot"" or ""what if aliens inserted themselves into our memories so they could take us over by convincing us they'd always been there"". You could write great novels about that stuff. But he'd give these ideas an episode or two, then just ignore them. Not really a magic reset button, he just moves on. Like, why has the Doctor never run into the Silence in the past if they've been here all along?

For what it's worth, I actually think seasons 5-6 were great, 7-8 were lousy, and he's gotten his groove back in 9-10. Here's hoping the Christmas special is good, I'd love to see both him and Capaldi given the send-off they deserve."
Twice Upon A Time,He was better as a writer not a showrunner
Twice Upon A Time,Moffat does good one off episodes. This doesn't mean he is a good showrunner
Twice Upon A Time,"> Is the Moffat hate even justified at this point?

IMO Series  9 is one of the worst seasons in the history of the show, so yes."
Twice Upon A Time,Bring back tennant
Twice Upon A Time,"It was different, but it was arguably worse. Nine's was pretty perfect. Ten's was way too explosive and saccharine. Eleven's (on the clock tower) was one of the show's dumbest scenes of *all* time.

And Moffat's confirmed that Capaldi's is going to be the most explosive yet, so I'm already guaranteed to not like it."
Twice Upon A Time,"Well, he was probably distracted by the fact that he didn't like the colour of his kidneys."
Twice Upon A Time,"The Wilfred part of it was pretty awful, but the memory trip was nice."
Twice Upon A Time,"10 was kind of an ass, though"
Twice Upon A Time,He was Walder Frey in *GoT*.
Twice Upon A Time,"I liked her far more than Clara, so I don't mind seeing Bill come back. But if I never saw Clara again, it would be too soon"
Twice Upon A Time,"I kind of like that companions don't usually get definitive endings though. The show is about following the Doctor and his/her adventures, so I like that the companions usually had lives before and after meeting the doctor. It makes it feel like they really were just visitors in the life of a near immortal, and, like real life, the ending of a relationship is not always the definitive ending for both people. Sometimes they go to convoluted lengths to find reasons for people to stop traveling with the doctor without dying though. I wish more companions would just get old and say their done adventuring, have a traumatic adventure and leave like Martha, or become frustrated with the Doctor and leave like Clara almost did in the Danny Pink season."
Twice Upon A Time,"She should've died. She tried playing Doctor in Face the Raven and it backfired and she should've died. But they resurrected her. I like Clara, and her death was a tragic, emotionally potent scene.

The last 5 minutes of the season finale undid that.

She now gets to run around for however long she wants pretending to be The Doctor. No consequences for her choices, except that at some point she has to choose to die, be it in a hundred, a thousand, a million years.

Had she chosen to return to her death at the end of this episode it would have potentiallly been even more impactful than the first time. Instead, any weight of her death is removed. I was literally angry that there were no consequences whatsoever"
Twice Upon A Time,Doesn’t stop them from doing audiodramas set before that point. Adric has appeared in some of those. 
Twice Upon A Time,"A kids show that airs in prime-time. A kids show that had the Doctor dealing for years with the trauma of believing he killed his people. A kids show that shows the Doctor being shot dead in Utah, causing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, brainwashing humanity into killing Silents. We've seen the result of a human turned into a Dalek, a companion maimed into the first Cyberman.

My point is there's been plenty of messed up stuff on DW."
Twice Upon A Time,Never actually been a kids show according to the BBC - it's always been produced by the Drama department.
Twice Upon A Time,"Either way, I expect BBCA to give us horrible spoilers *during the episode.* During World Enough and Time, they were practically screaming into our faces that Bill would be the Cyberman. "
Twice Upon A Time,I'm terrible with faces so when he pulled off the disguise I was genuinely surprissd
Twice Upon A Time,"Wow, that is a nuclear take, lol."
Twice Upon A Time,"Bring back Baker. 

You know, the good Baker.

Not that one."
Twice Upon A Time,The implication for Ten is that it was so massive because he spent two hours moping about it and holding it back rather regenerating. Eleven regenerated by jump cut because he was so at peace with it.
Twice Upon A Time,"I agree completely.  I don't really complain, since it's technically a family show, but the shows desire to neatly tie everything in a little bow really emotionally divorces me from a lot of the finales.  Even when something ""real"" happens, it affects me a lot less than it should because I'm just not expecting it to stick"
Twice Upon A Time,"Bill should definitely have died in that battle. The Doctor should have found her lifeless cyber body in the aftermath, no oil ghosts, no last words exposition from Bill, just a blank face. I feel the Doctor is a far better character when you know he's really fucking up. In all honestly he's a very self centred character who fools himself into thinking he's making the hard choices to save the day. Instead he forces or encourages eager individuals to throw themselves into the lion's den, and it usually ends up bad.

One thing I found interesting about Face the Raven was the very quick shot of the Cyberman getting a tune up. It could imply some Cybermen didn't tow the company line.

Speaking of the Cybermen, I'd like to see an episode where they are believe it or not, the good guys for once. Imagine this: 

The TARDIS draws the Doctor and [insert companion name here] to a planet where the locals are suffering a seemingly incurable illness that will wipe them out in a matter of days. The virus only affects them. The Cybermen landed before our heroes and are offering said species some kind of implant to keep the virus at bay. The Doctor having his deep seated hate and suspicion of the Cybermen wastes time and resources trying to prove they spread the virus but can't prove it, so much so that he tries to prevent them getting the implants insisting he can come up with a cure for them. Deep down he knows for once the Cybermen are here to save the people from the virus, not immediately convert them. The people banish the Doctor he's forced to leave.

The Doctor knows he'll meet these people again probably as cybermen, but is unsure whether he'll have it in him to destroy them even if they have turned into villains by that point.


Considering the Cybermen were born of a need to survive the odds, it seems credible that at least early or late into their life span they would seek to convert people facing similar fates they did as Mondasians just to save them rather than assimilate them."
Twice Upon A Time,"I'm just saying, I think they have made an effort to give almost every character a time period where all sorts of stuff could have happened for audios."
Twice Upon A Time,Don't forget the Pansexual time agent.
Twice Upon A Time,"Don't forget the times they killed off a couple companions, too.."
Twice Upon A Time,"In the 1980s, we had a villain's head melt."
Twice Upon A Time,Eleven should have been at peace with it considering he lived for thousands of years longer than any other incarnation (as far as we know).
Twice Upon A Time,"> The implication for Ten is that it was so massive because he spent two hours moping about it and holding it back rather regenerating.

I understand the logic, I just think it's dumb.

> Eleven regenerated by jump cut because he was so at peace with it.

Again, I'm talking about the clock tower scene, not the TARDIS"
Twice Upon A Time,"They’re not necessarily constrained by when a character came or went on the show. River has had adventures with the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Doctors, and is supposed to meet the Fourth and Fifth, if I’m not mistaken. "
Twice Upon A Time,People with diffent sexualities is not a polemic topic in Britain.
Twice Upon A Time,"The only full-time companion to die and not get better, not live on in some way was Adric. Amy and Rory died, sure, but offscreen after a long, full life together."
Twice Upon A Time,"He was ~1200 in Day of the Doctor and Twelve says he's over 2,000 years old in Deep Breath. So hundreds of years, but yeah."
Twice Upon A Time,I get that. That was an...admittedly odd scene. But there wasn't much precedent for Moff to rely on for his deus ex machina.
Twice Upon A Time,But River has unknown periods in her timeline where anything could have happened. They have given every Doctor and Companion the same
Twice Upon A Time,"Katrina died, as did Sara Kingdom. Although admittedly Sara is disputed as a companion for only being one story."
Twice Upon A Time,I thought Eleven spent like sixteen hundred years just dicking around trying not to die?
Twice Upon A Time,"I think Clara has a few unknown periods in her timeline, too, since the Doctor seems to just pick her up and drop her off. "
Twice Upon A Time,More like 900.
Twice Upon A Time,"I feel like I've wasted 5 hours of my life on this show. Why do all euro netflix shows include the same ""mystery"" soundtrack aka the annoying violins."
Twice Upon A Time,"I’ve just finished it and have no idea what I’ve just watched. None of the questions were answered. 

There seemed to be a connection to Iceland, but as to what that connection was I haven’t a clue."
Twice Upon A Time,I binged it late Saturday. Not entirely sure why they chose to not include an actual ending.
Twice Upon A Time,I ran into the same search issue.  I watched the first episode and liked it but wasn't overwhelmed.  How were episodes 2-4?   Are the lukewarm IMDb reviews representative of how you found it?  Or not?
Twice Upon A Time,"This was a mind fuck all around. By the end of the series the timelines got super confusing. I was hoping the final episode would link these timelines together and provide us with some closure, however that never came. Clearly none of this will be cleared up until season two. I think it's shitty to leave so much open ended, although I do enjoy it as a show, I feel a bit blue balled here. Further complicating this is the fact it's from a French studio so most news and discussion is all in french. 

If you haven't watched yet I might save this until more episodes come out. I'm just sitting here trying to piece together what the hell I just watched. Very Memento-esque. Like the movie, I'm hoping all the confusion is worth it for a great plot twist at the end. With only 5 episodes available, we will have to wait it seems."
Twice Upon A Time,I enjoyed it. European shows are always a little more artsy.
Twice Upon A Time,"Yes, to be honest it kind of lost my interest but I still wanted to continue to see how it ended. It had a subplot about windmills and some side characters like the mailman and others that isn't ever expanded on, and suddenly brought back in at the end. I was hoping to find discussion to see what it is that I may have missed that pieces everything together without having to rewatch it again. It really didn't have any AHA moments that make me want to revisit it, unfortunately."
Twice Upon A Time,So maybe you‘ve got more informations about the series than I dot - but Wikipedia says there are no more seasons and the series only consists of these 4 episodes. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Twice Upon A Time,"At first I thought OUAT was a terrible concept. Then I started watching and realized, oh, this is a great concept (and mostly great acting)! Then kept going and went, oh, they’re doing this very poorly."
Twice Upon A Time,"Fuck that.

It's called FABLES. The show Once tried to be but gave up. 

And the game A Wolf Among Us

That's what I want"
Twice Upon A Time,"Fuck that, Galavant season 3...let's fucking go!"
Twice Upon A Time,"They tried something similar from the same people who made Once Upon A Time but didn't greenlight it after making the pilot. 

>Epic, the Disney-themed fairy tale anthology, is not moving forward at ABC.

>The Disney-owned broadcast network has opted to not pick up the drama pilot to series. Ordered to pilot in January under new network topper Craig Erwich, Epic would have marked a homecoming to ABC for Once Upon a Time creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis. The duo exec produced Epic alongside writer Brigitte Hales, who previously worked with Horowitz and Kitsis on Once Upon a Time and their short-lived Apple anthology Amazing Stories.

>Sources say the pilot didn’t come in strong despite execs being excited about the script. The pilot was filmed in Ireland, and, because of the pandemic, Kitsis and Horowitz were unable to go on location for the shoot.

Twice Upon A Time,"I think you're onto something. The actors who depicted those characters in OUaT are not the same people who depicted them in previous adaptations of those stories:

In the 'real world' of OUaT, the story of Cinderella existed which means that the movie where Julie Andrews played the character can exist. But the in their world there is no actress named Dania Ramirez, instead that body/face belongs exclusively to their real world Cinderella.

Now take the same logic and apply to a new Disney property like Star Wars. In our world, the story of SW exists. But if a SW version of OUaT was made, it would play out a scenario in which the 'real' SW characters traveled through a worm-hole the show's version of Earth. In that show, a new actor could depict Luke."

Also the [Alice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeCZVnGDsZ4&ab_channel=YutakaYamada-Topic) [in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI3698syVHg&ab_channel=YutakaYamada-Topic) [borderland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGvHCg-uVmQ&ab_channel=YutakaYamada-Topic) score is pretty powerful. Some intros that are solid also:

[Babylon Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA690TpCa5s) intro captures the art, the deco, the decadence and the violence of what the viewer knows is going to come of that time period.

[Black Sails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFTcA4QLHw0) just perfect

[Raised by Wolves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHyq5UCVh4w) I was hit and miss on this in many ways, but this intro is great - albeit I think slightly misleading as to its overall tone.

[Pennyworth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWv7N-MxD0Y) I thought S1 was a bit silly, but what an intro.

[Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_iAtz1HZ0g) This is just fun, and fits the show brilliantly

[See](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Ugh6wbz94) also isn't bad"
Soundtrack,The Beverly Hillbillies has a complex system of leitmotif evoking different moods and characters.
Soundtrack,Warrior
Soundtrack,"I kind of wish Brian Tyler did the new Dune soundtrack because his Children of Dune soundtrack is still one of my favorite TV soundtracks and one of my favorites in general. It's in my Dune head canon with the books and the original movie soundtrack. 

Summon the Worms was used really well in one of The Chronicles Narnia trailers and War Begins got a great remix for the 2009 Star Trek trailer."
Soundtrack,"Adding Martin Phipps for BBC War and Peace. Which is an amazing series many haven’t seen.

Soundtrack,"All of these comments have forgotten the face of their father, because the best TV score is [Planet Earth 2.](https://youtu.be/c8aFcHFu8QM) Watch that and try to tell me it's not.

In the soundtrack category we have [Malcolm in the Middle](https://youtu.be/UESp6wiEH2A)

Also very good: Scrubs, True Detective"
Soundtrack,Basically all of Attack on Titan. Shinzo wo Sasageyo could make me march to certain death
Soundtrack,Buffy
Soundtrack,Legion had a great soundtrack.
Soundtrack,OP — you have excellent taste.
Soundtrack,Ramin Djawadi's work on Person of Interest and Game of Thrones.
Soundtrack,Lost Season 1 score was great!
Soundtrack,Game of thrones is number 1. No contest
Soundtrack,The Leftovers is one of my favourite shows. I liked the S1 theme much better than the song they used for S2.
Soundtrack,THIS
Soundtrack,"Bear McCreary was the first time I ever actually looked up who did the score on a TV show.  

Prelude to War is just an amazing track on its own. You would never guess it came from a basic cable sci-fi show."
Soundtrack,Battlestar's score is fantastic. Crazy to think that it was his first time scoring a TV show and that he was only in his mid-20s when he started on it. Outlander and Rings of Power are a couple of my other McCreary favorites.
Soundtrack,Ahh I was gonna include that but I didn’t wanna list too many. Such a great song (and show!)
Soundtrack,Death Note yes. Fruits Basket only and new reboot too.
Soundtrack,Save one...

Soundtrack,Yes!!
Soundtrack,Thank you :)
Soundtrack,"I remember watching season 8, and even when Arya killed the Night King, I was hyped as fuck solely due to the music. Ramin absolutely fucking killed it the entire series run. Even though the writing dropped the ball a few times over the series (And then yeeted it off a cliff in the final seasons), the music was always absolutely on point."
Soundtrack,"Except ""Prelude to War"" is essentially a cover of Phillip Glass' [November 25: Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw8aIjIvriA) from [Mishisma](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089603/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) (1985)."

Bones does a similar thing to Scrubs. Radical Face were my favourite find."

Soundtrack,Utopia and The leftovers soundtracks.
Soundtrack,"**This is about to be a Bear McCreary thread**, I'm pretty sure

Because there's **Battlestar Galactica**, of course, a legitimate tour de force utilizing leitmotif to an incredible degree, made even more incredible by the fact the show began with a different composer whose whole thing was that the music was mostly just percussion and tonal modulations. Man made an epic so beloved he was able to take the *score* to a *television show* (and a TV show on the fucking SyFy network, LOL) on a *tour.* 

But then there's *also* the one-two punch of **Eureka** and **Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles**, which he was doing simultaneously at one point and which have two ridiculously different tones; Eureka doing the most to channel some of the more jaunty, fun vibes of his mentor, Elmer Bernstein, and of course; Terminator, which took a lot of Brad Fiedel's original ideas and then basically Battlestar'd them. It's not really arguable that, in all the various attempts at expanding the Terminator universe, say what you will about the stories but McCreary *easily* composed the best music IN that universe. 

And from there, I mean... pick your poisons, because dude doesn't really let up. **Black Sails, Outlander, Foundation**. And then, again, say what you will about **The Rings Of Power** as a narrative (I have my own problems with that execution myself) I don't know how one can argue that the music for that thing isn't, at the least, absolutely remarkable. 

Anyway, yeah: If there's a ""Best soundtrack"" for television, it's **Battlestar**. And then there are any number of great arguments for numbers 2-10 (I'd like to put up Reznor/Ross's **Watchmen**, Mac Quayle's **Mr. Robot**, and Ramin Dijwadi's **Game of Thrones**, and Giacchino's **LOST**, and it goes on)."
Soundtrack,"Letterkenny is good, Shoresy is amazing"
Soundtrack,Smallville has a great ‘00s soundtrack. The early seasons especially did a great job matching songs to emotions and situations happening in the show.
Soundtrack,If you liked Scrubs soundtrack you’d dig The OC as well. That’s one of my favorites.
Soundtrack,Chuck had a great soundtrack. Found so many great songs through that show.
Soundtrack,S U C C E S S I O N
Soundtrack,Andor

Soundtrack,"Arcane's soundtrack is incredible. The show really feels like a work of art; the visuals and music are individually amazing, but the combination of the two hits a whole new level."
Soundtrack,Breaking Bad
Soundtrack,"Gray’s Anatomy Vol 1&2 were both pretty good. 

If you’re talking score any of Bear McCreary’s scores from his shows are all great. I think my favorite is Season 2 of BSG."
Soundtrack,1899 has great episode-ending songs.
Soundtrack,"Scrubs, O.C., Veronica Mars"
Soundtrack,LOST
Soundtrack,Westworld is the only show whose soundtrack gave me a sense of emotional enlightenment.
Soundtrack,"Why is nobody talking about the Twilight soundtrack??? Talk shit all you want, the music was fantastic"
Soundtrack,Umbrella Academy
Soundtrack,Batman Forever. edit: yes its a movie but still thats where my mind goes when I think killer soundtrack
Soundtrack,"Skins, with the original music from broadcast."
Soundtrack,Inside Llewyn Davis
Soundtrack,My name is earl
Soundtrack,"Loki had a great soundtrack,  Outlander too, and obviously Game of Thrones.   Utopia was trippy. 

Out of those not mentioned (I think),  Banshee had a terrific one, I still listen to so many songs I discovered on that show.   Sons of Anarchy also had some good soundtracks,  as did The Blacklist and Luke Cage.

And while I don't put The Walking Dead on that level, I still can't hear Oats in the Water without getting incredibly sad because of THAT episode."
Soundtrack,"The OC - a soundtrack that still holds up almost 20 years later. 

These are also fairly unconventional for this sub, but The Real World and The Challenge always had/have had phenomenal music in first-run on MTV (older seasons don’t retain their music on rebroadcast or streaming)."

Soundtrack,The Addams Family 😂
Soundtrack,"Andor Miami scene,
Black Sails OST"
Soundtrack,"Loves Breaking Bad and some of the music choices on it were solid. There's not music in every episode but when there is, it fits the series well."
Soundtrack,"Squid Game is epic

Any of the Disney Star Wars Shows

I guess those technically would be considered a score though

I like the songs sung in Emily in Paris"
Soundtrack,Derry Girls
Soundtrack,Fear the Walking Dead drives me nuts but any show that throws on The Mountain Goats gets my vote.
Soundtrack,"If you can ignore everything else, the Emily in Paris soundtrack actually has a great mix of French pop music that I’ve really come to enjoy."
Soundtrack,"There was an HBO show called Vinyl about the music industry in the 70’s, and the soundtrack was absolutely brilliant; basically every big name pop and rock star bands from that era; Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Iggy Pop, Otis Redding, Chuck Berry, Black Sabbath, Dusty Springfield, Lou Reed, Velvet Underground, David Bowie, The Who, James Brown, Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd, Janis Joplin, Procal Harum, The Doors, Little Richard, The Beach Boys, Van Morrison, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello, Simon and Garfunkel, Queen, Chic, and many many more."

Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Looks pretty gruesome; I hope they don't show the videos. I may watch if I hear from the rest of you that they catch the guy.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,My first thought was that video of a girl throwing kittens into a river.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Okay this is certainly unique. Might check it out
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,[removed]
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,They won't. One of them is a full on snuff film. He was caught.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"thats fucked up and all, but yeahhh .... this piece of shit guy was way way way WAY WAYYYYYYY worse."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Found the cat guy...end of documentary.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Any links to the news articles?
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"If you're interested in the case, I suggest you read the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Magnotta?wprov=sfla1) page about this guy. It has pretty much everything you need to know."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Probably Luka himself. He was obsessed with himself and the potential for fame.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"I've been wondering this too, and I'm surprised no one is talking about this. The entire show was about them trying to find the killer using the most insane techniques, and the identity was just randomly handed to them by an anonymous source and they just moved on. 

I'm guessing it was Luka. He wanted the fame and was frustrated that they weren't catching on quick enough, so he helped them."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"A friend of mine hypothesized it was one of his family members. I figure either that, or he himself did it."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"While it seems like the internet group did nothing to help in Luka's capture, either because LEA didn't pay attention to them, or because they were just gifted information, depending on the occasion... None of that matters to me because there angle that made the story so fascinating was the escalation... It was the way Luka's went from animal abuse and taunting that group to human murder and international chase...

Often times things happening in corners of the internet just seem so small and inconsequential... And seeing it escalate was just crazy... So the internet angle was important to the story, even if the internet sleuths offered very little of consequence."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,It was Manny /s
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,">  Did Luka tip off himself?

The doc glossed over that."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,I couldnt get into it. That lady just pisses me off. She thinks shes some kind of authority on the internet because she says she can be whoever she wants and it's obvious she has no life. If she got pissed about the cat videos I'd hate to see her go to run the gauntlet. I just cant stand her.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer," IMO clearly Luca himself, since that’s how they “solved” anything

One of the most disrespectful crime docs I’ve seen. Upsets me those “internet detectives” made a dime off it"
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,This
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,It was a good story but the whole thing was a bit misleading. She and the rest of the Internet goofs really didn't do much initially.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,what was disrespectful about it?
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"Nah, it seems like it was just her bitchin about something she didnt like and had to play internet detective which gave the guy what he wanted, fame 

Edit: how am I wrong? When every thread says that its just him trying to get what he wants, fame. You are feeding into the bullshit he started it with. He didnt give a fuck, he had many accounts talking about himself, but when I say it I'm wrong? Reddit, you fuckers need to get your godamn priorities straight."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"It is like some type of vanity project for these internet detectives that did literally nothing but feed into Luca’s motivations. It calls Luca a genius at points despite his constant stupidity, and it does this because otherwise the internet detectives would have to admit they have no idea what they’re doing. If not disrespectful to the victim, disrespectful to the police who actually solved it.

At its core it makes it all about cats and kooky internet antics when an actual human being was sexually assaulted and murdered on video."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"No, you need to see the light.  The internet sleuths made the case because they lured his ass out.  Do you think he would have played his little cat and mouse game (no pun intended) with the LEA's that had jurisdiction?  He was playing with the internet gang because he thought he was completely anonymous.  Because he was giving up so much information to them, he became findable.  The point of the show was not - look who found the guy.  The point was - the internet is not your safe space where you can be anyone you want and hide forever."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"I really don't understand how you can feel they did literally nothing.  Unless what you mean by literally nothing, you mean, lure the guy out of to show himself as a real person, contact the Canadian police and Interpol, and provide a pretty decent amount of evidence to help convict the guy.  Granted, the police found a garbage bag full of shit leading to Luka, the internet group already knew his name and already knew he was escalating and already contact several LEA's, and were completely ignored.  So I'm kinda puzzled by what you mean.  I also think if one single LEA person would have confronted this kid earlier on, an innocent mans life might have been saved.  We'll never know.  In my opinion though, it's dismissive of you to say the internet gang didn't do shit.  They identified a killer well before he actually killed a person.  How did you possibly miss that?  Or did you not really watch the show for comprehension?"
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"I was more referring to the guy they claimed was the bomber and wasnt but they were so sure about it and wasnt but they just knew he was, until he killed himself. That's what I was referring to"
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"I don’t mean to make out that the internet detectives are bad people if I came off like that but they are naive and have big egos. 

By “not doing anything” I mean they did not find the info about Luca. They were given it, by someone we can pretty much be sure was Luca himself. From the moment they were tipped off about him, to when they got his name. That was given to them; not found. Now we can argue if they could’ve done more then send an email to Toronto police after a murder took place, maybe so, maybe not. But we do know that they did not effect much at all.

Obviously nobody is truly responsible but Luca himself, but at the end she blames the audience for egging him on?? As far as I know, she is the one who interacted with him as the murder took place and the one who helped make a doc about him where he is called a “genius”. Sounds like she did exactly as he wanted. I’m just watching a doc"
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"But didn't that guy insert himself into the fiasco?  I don't recall the specifics, but I don't think they just threw a dart and unfairly accused him.  I seem to remember him saying something on FB like - hey im the guy."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"But...   do you think Luka would have stepped out to give his own name and start that little game if those people hadn’t begun hunting for him?  He said it in the letter he wrote when he said how fun it was to watch people chase him and come up with nothing because he was always one step ahead.  He wasn’t though - not always. They got a step ahead of him. This is clear and undeniable.  
LEA’s failed to act until a person was killed.  They didn’t care about cats.  This is also clear.  Back to the main point though, there’s no reason at all to believe that if the internet gang hadn’t started their search that he would have started posting more identifying material or anything that would have led to him revealing himself.  It was his narcissism/ego that led to his downfall and I firmly believe that however petty it was in the beginning for BM and John to feed his ego and make him a priority in their lives, they still knew who he was, what he was up to, and what was going to happen well before the police.  Would he have escalated without their involvement?  I feel he would have.  Did he make a major fuck up by leaving his ID and other info in a bag near the crime scene?  Indeed he did.  But considering his ego, he may have done that on purpose because of the cat/mouse game he was playing.  That may not have been an accident at all.  So that takes me back to his desire to leave a trail and encourage people to follow - which is exactly what the internet gang did.  I just think their actions played a significantly more valuable role than people want to admit."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"If you can credit the internet detectives for Luca revealing himself, you can also blame them for feeding into Luca’s desires, which escalated to him killing a human. I don’t think that is their fault, I think they were observers."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,He was going to kill a person regardless of his internet activities.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"Oh damn, I didn't realize this was Lehane, that definitely makes me more excited for it."
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Paul Walter Hauser has been killing it
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,I am so excited for this one.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Paul Walter Hauser is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. He’s so fucking good and needs to be protected at all costs. He chooses the best projects; to go from I Think You Should Leave to this and just murder every scene he’s in is remarkable.  A virtuoso that remains under appreciated.
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,so sorta like Mindhunters? I'm in

Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"I'm seeing ""teleplay by"", ""written by"", ""story by"", ""screenplay by"" all listed in his writing credits. Can someone please give me a quick breakdown of those in comparison to each other?

I'm assuming the screenplay and teleplay are the same thing, just named for medium (films and TV respectively).

There's also ""based on the novel by"" and ""novel"", but those are a bit more self explanatory."

Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,Definitely is!!!
Dont F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer,"When I first saw him playing the Juggalo kid on It's Always Sunny, I would've never imagined he'd turn out to be such a great and versatile actor."

The Crimson Rivers,Capaldi gave the role 110% pretty much his entire run. The fact that he was such a big fan of the show growing up really makes it special.
The Crimson Rivers,"These actors had such great chemistry. On the whole, I never really connected with the River arc, but a big part of that was that I felt her and Matt Smith never really clicked. This was the only time it felt like the characters were actually attracted to each other.

I wonder how River and the 13th Doctor would have been."
The Crimson Rivers,That speech by Alex Kingston (River Song) was a masterclass in acting... and it was wonderful to watch Capaldi's face while she spoke.
The Crimson Rivers,Such an amazing Doctor!
The Crimson Rivers,12's run definitely had its issues but man I loved this moment.
The Crimson Rivers,By far one my least favorite characters. She felt like some sort of weird self-insert oc from a badly written fanfic.
The Crimson Rivers,One of the all-time yummiest Doctor Who scenes.
The Crimson Rivers,"I know it’s an unpopular opinion but I prefered Capaldi’s doctor to Matt Smith. 

The writing was better during Matt Smith, but the performance was better with Capaldi."
The Crimson Rivers,He was horrible and boring and old lol. I don’t understand why anyone would think he did well but I see others agreeing with you so I guess I’m the weird one.
The Crimson Rivers,"yeah, I really wish River Song and Peter Capaldi had way more episodes together"
The Crimson Rivers,"I don't think it's so much an unpopular opinion anymore. As time has progressed (and I think a direct comparison with Chibnall's run on the show has helped) people seem to be realizing on revisits that Capaldi's run (and specifically his run post-Clara) is some of the best Doctor Who, period. 

The reappraisal of Capaldi happened pretty soon after he was gone, and it's been mostly positive."
The Crimson Rivers,"I wanted to, but he never grabbed my attention, I did like his suit a lot tho"
The Crimson Rivers,"It's the attack eyebrows

They're very intimidating at first look"
The Crimson Rivers,who frowned him that face!
The Crimson Rivers,"*""Oh go on, crack a smile, I want to see if your eyebrows fall off.""*"
The Crimson Rivers,"I remember his AMA where every time someone asked him about Vampire Diaries and The Originals, he made no effort to hide the fact that he clearly didn't like the show."
The Crimson Rivers,oh i had no idea roku had the us rights to newsreader. been wanting to check it out.
The Crimson Rivers,Just watched the first episode of this - BBC2 have it here. Really quite good. Anna Torv in particular.
The Crimson Rivers,Dudes chin could be in the Illuminati
The Crimson Rivers,it's very watchable - enjoy.
The Crimson Rivers,Best comeback story since Kim Kardashian
The Crimson Rivers,Showing the period where she was poised to replace Carson will be interesting
The Crimson Rivers,Yes!  Kathryn Hahn is going to absolutely nail this role.  I'm predicting an Emmy win.
The Crimson Rivers,"Kathryn Hahn is so hot right now between this, Knives Out 2, and The Shrink Next Door. I'm totally down for a Kathryn-naissance."
The Crimson Rivers,"At least on the surface, seems like a pretty great match."
The Crimson Rivers,Isn’t hacks which I’m a fan of already loosely based on her?
The Crimson Rivers,Poncho!
The Crimson Rivers,Does anyone else remember her from Crossing Jordan? She has allllllllways been great
The Crimson Rivers,I'm just here to point out it's executive produced by Dick Suckle.
The Crimson Rivers,"I was hoping for either [Jackie Tohn](https://youtu.be/7Bx7CFiWfU0) or [Sharon Needles](https://youtu.be/1MfqZS6wyIY), but Kathryn will kill it regardless."
The Crimson Rivers,"She's killing it lately, she's getting all sorts of rolls."
The Crimson Rivers,"But seriously, can we talk?"
The Crimson Rivers,Give me Kathryn Hahn in anything.
The Crimson Rivers,"Serious question, why do people hate Joan Rivers so much? No one is saying anything in this particular thread, but a few years before she died it seems like she was kind of a punching bag or just plain rubbed people the wrong way. 

I think she was around doing certain things at an interesting time - sometime in the 90's the culture took a real shift - maybe that was part of it."
The Crimson Rivers,Great news! Joan Rivers had an interesting career that definitely merits a series.
The Crimson Rivers,It's been Agatha all along!
The Crimson Rivers,"I’m sorry but Joan was just so singular and fantastic…..but Kathryn Hahn is also singular and fantastic…..dammit, it might work."
The Crimson Rivers,Perfect casting.
The Crimson Rivers,Poncho!
The Crimson Rivers,"If you were going to go looks-wise, I could really see Abigail Spencer, but I don't know if she has the comedic talent that Kathryn Hahn has."
The Crimson Rivers,"I like Kathryn, glad to see she is doing so well lately."
The Crimson Rivers,It’s a shame no one will see it since it’s on showtime.
The Crimson Rivers,Kathryn Hahn can do no wrong!  This should be great.
The Crimson Rivers,A great choice to play Joan Rivers.
The Crimson Rivers,I love Joan Rivers. I'll definitely watch this.
The Crimson Rivers,"That’s cool.  Hopefully the series is true to life, Joan Rivers was a B.  Arrogant, rude and entitled.  Any other portrayal of her would be pure fiction."
The Crimson Rivers,"But will she play a Jewish, gender bent C3P0?"
The Crimson Rivers,ANDY!
The Crimson Rivers,Well....
The Crimson Rivers,"Especially since they are casting Gilbert Gottfried as Johnny Carson.

DeVito is playing Ed McMahon."
The Crimson Rivers,should've gone to mario cantone
The Crimson Rivers,[deleted]
The Crimson Rivers,Hahnissance
The Crimson Rivers,"She’s phenomenal in Step Brothers and The Goods! Substantially different characters, and she nails them both"
The Crimson Rivers,Same. I’ve been a Kathryn Hahn fan since Step Brothers so I’ve been feeling like it’s been paying off.
The Crimson Rivers,"Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, too (although unofficially)"
The Crimson Rivers,Sharon would have been an actual nail in the coffin for this project.
The Crimson Rivers,"Jackie absolutely nailed that performance, I hope Hahn will be as good, but rapping in character is damn impressive."
The Crimson Rivers,What kinda rolls? Sweet? Buttered?
The Crimson Rivers,"I’m old and remember when this happened. 
She was a successful and funny, and frequently appeared on the Johnny Carson show, aka The Tonight Show. (This was really before women were successful in comedy, or anything else for that matter unless the males allowed it)
Eventually, she was tapped as guest host, filling in for Carson when he took time off.
She was so funny and so successful that she was offered her OWN show, on another network, airing on opposite network from the Tonight Show, essentially becoming competition.
And she had the godamn audacity to accept the job. (/s in case)
Carson never forgave her, the show tanked, and it took YEARS for her to recover, if she even did.


TL/DR: she tried to smash the patriarchy of Hollywood and was burned at the stake for it. 
And there’s always some asshat that says sexism doesn’t exist…"
The Crimson Rivers,"Watch her video about how Palestinians deserved to get massacred, and if they didn’t want to die they should just leave Gaza. Her whole rant is up on YouTube. 

I’m sure others have other reasons for disliking her, but that video is loathsome."
The Crimson Rivers,"I have mad respect for her.  These are my favourite videos of her:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ULxBavIdZQo&t=8s

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rAD-ky3TYQk"
The Crimson Rivers,Misogyny
The Crimson Rivers,"The question is, will Gottfried use something close to his real voice, or his stage voice?"
The Crimson Rivers,She went to the same acting schools frances McDormand and Meryl Streep went too Yale drama. Yale school of drama mfa really rivals Juilliard drama imo
The Crimson Rivers,"I've been on the Kathryn Hahn train for years now.

Glad to see everyone else is starting to take notice."
The Crimson Rivers,I almost picked [Jimbo's performance](https://youtu.be/iu4y0TZLGkM) but we didn't see enough of it.
The Crimson Rivers,And here I thought everyone had gotten over that and that they were bothered by the whole red carpet/Fashion Police thing.
The Crimson Rivers,"But is that all there is too it? Was she not controversial ot a degree throughout her career? I got the impression that people felt she was very 'gossipy', but for some reason later in her career that wouldn't fly - like her brand of humor was not acceptable any more. Almost like how Dice was acceptable and then he wasn't - but, you know, not quite the same.

I guess I'm more looking for people who were rubbed the wrong way by her humor and what exactly rubbed them the wrong way.

Maybe there was the thing with Carson, but up until the end she had plenty of presence in the media, her voice was always out there - that's why you had people talking about how annoying she was; if she had been cancelled, she would nto have been in the media any enough for people to even talk about her."
The Crimson Rivers,"That's not why people didn't like her. The reason people didn't like her was because long after her stand-up career she became a b-list gossip mill who took cheap shots at everyone. She was essentially the precursor to folks like Perez Hilton and Wendy Williams, except maybe slightly funnier."
The Crimson Rivers,Ah - I think this is probably the type of thing that makes people have that level of loathing you usually see with celebrities like Nancy Grace. I didn't even know about this.
The Crimson Rivers,"So, the society changed to become more misogynistic in the mid 90's in your opinion? I'm not saying you're wrong, but that is an uncommon view - do you care to elaborate? I honestly would be interested in hearing more about your perspective."
The Crimson Rivers,"He's a talented impressionist, I expect he'll do Johnny's voice."
The Crimson Rivers,"I know we all hate Spacey for being just the worst, but man he would have been perfect as Carson.  His Carson sounds exactly like Johnny, it's nuts."
The Crimson Rivers,"Gilbert does a terrible Carson on my favourite episode of the Norm podcast. It’s so bad, it’s great."
The Crimson Rivers,Just Gilbert being Gilbert. Brave choice.
The Crimson Rivers,"Oooh, good point! I had to research it because that’s all new to me. ( no tv for the last several years)
It may be a lot of different occurrences, including her fawning over trump that time. 
It’s a shame though, because she was funny and talented and hard working and driven, and smart."
The Crimson Rivers,"I definitely think you’re right- she was gossipy and really went after the celebs early in her career.
I also feel her husband’s suicide hurt her career, sadly."
The Crimson Rivers,The mouse got to Hahn… She Agatha now
The Crimson Rivers,"I figured after the success of Hacks which is kind of a fictional version of this, this project became less interesting."
The Crimson Rivers,Sarah Silverman sends her jewgards
The Crimson Rivers,"I liked Joan in her stand-up days and I have a bit of a crush on Kathryn Hahn, so I'd have watched.  Oh well."
The Crimson Rivers,I read this wrong. Was trying to figure how Joan Rivers was making a TV show with Kathryn Hahn despite the rigor mortis.
The Crimson Rivers,Dang I was hoping for a Joan rivers cinematic universe where it could cross over with marvelous mrs maisel
The Crimson Rivers,"I hate this modern trend of announcing shows before even a pilot is shot. Just tell us when  a show is greenlit and when it is going to air. Then you can do a deep dive into the storyline and who is going to play whom. Otherwise, it's always a deep disappointment to hear potential shows with potential actors that inevitably fall through the cracks. 

I am still waiting for CW's take on The Lost Boys. And it has been what? Two or three years since they've announced it. They keep on dangling that show."
The Crimson Rivers,"Is jewface a thing? 

please dont tell me you can veto a casting decision based on religion now..."
The Crimson Rivers,"""Because of issues around the life rights of Joan Rivers, a limited series in which Kathryn Hahn would have played the legendary comedian isn’t moving forward."""
The Crimson Rivers,She was Agatha all along.
The Crimson Rivers,"Out of curiosity, did Joan Rivers have a go-to writer like Jean’s character in Hacks? I understand it’s not a direct correlation, but I don’t know much about the history of Rivers."
The Crimson Rivers,"I think Mrs. Maisel is closer to a fictional version of Joan Rivers. Also it's really good.

Edit: realized that it might sound like I'm saying Hacks wasn't good. It was fantastic."
The Crimson Rivers,"Seriously.. her comment smacks of privilege.. ""its ok for us to play caucasian people who are not jewish but the opposite is a racism."""
The Crimson Rivers,Did she send it while in blackface?
The Crimson Rivers,You win the thread.
The Crimson Rivers,"Oh thank Hahn, I thought it was just me"
The Crimson Rivers,"It's not a modern trend, this stuff was always announced in industry trades and Variety is one of those. There's tons of people who work on this stuff and it would get leaked anyway. It's not even really ""announced"", the trades usually find out from someone involved that it's happening and that's how it winds up being reported. Often it's even done to influence the deals being made."
The Crimson Rivers,The have dropped The Lost Boys. Project is dead at the CW. They did announce it is going back into development at Warner Bros as a reboot movie.
The Crimson Rivers,"In other words ""The estate already told us no when we asked for the life rights, but we went ahead anyways and assumed they'd cave after we sold it to a network."""
The Crimson Rivers,You'd think making sure you actually had the rights to the thing you were making would be like the first step you would take on something like this.
The Crimson Rivers,So why are there life rights to a public person whose life is already public knowledge?
The Crimson Rivers,"I'd heard that Joan Rivers had filing cabinets full of 3x5 cards with jokes written on each, sorted by subject, and that she wrote the jokes."
The Trial,"""Breakout""? He's been beloved by geek culture ever since playing Oberyn Martell"
The Trial,"Game of Thrones, The Mentalist, Narcos, Mandalorian..."
The Trial,[deleted]
The Trial,"Breakout star that had major roles in Game of Thrones, The Mandalorian and Narcos?"
The Trial,What a load of shite. He's been a star for years. Absolutely killed it on Narcos
The Trial,Pedro was already an A list actor prior to the last of us
The Trial,a lot more people might actually know his name now but that headline doesn't seem right
The Trial,"This is like when articles were calling Tatiana Maslany a breakout star because of She Hulk, despite her huge popularity from Orphan Black."
The Trial,"I didn't know much about him until I saw him hosting SNL. He just came across as not only a good actor and funny, but a genuinely decent person."
The Trial,I was just watching a bunch of 70s movies and realized hes like the new Burt Reynolds.
The Trial,If we ever get a reboot of Tremors I know why I want to play Earl
The Trial,"He was just on the Graham Norton Show last week & appeared to be fairly drunk, it was pretty cringey to watch unfortunately. Had been looking forward to seeing him on Graham, so it was kind of a let down. Maybe he was nervous to be on the show & needed liquid courage or something."
The Trial,"All these talk of his other big roles and everyone forgets to mention Wonder Woman '84 , can't imagine why."
The Trial,And it's not like he hasn't been the lead actor in one of the biggest shows out there since 2019.
The Trial,He's been beloved by smaller circles for a long time but he's turned into a huge star now. My mom knows who Pedro Pascal is now.
The Trial,One of these things is not like the others...
The Trial,"No one ever seems to mention Narcos, but it was huge when it first came out and that was really his first leading role in TV."
The Trial,"Seriously...does everyone just forget about how awesome he was?


I think half of this stuff is written by AI."
The Trial,akshooally it was narcos
The Trial,"Yeah ""breakout"" wasn't the best choice of word for the title (especially since most folks on this subreddit are just going to read the headline), but the article does talk about the other major roles he has been in, how successful those shows/his roles were, how it increased his fame, presently culminating with The Last Of Us and The Mandalorian.

I think what the author is trying to say by ""breakout"" is twofold. First, that Pedro Pascal is the first *standout* actor so far of *this year*, 2023. One could say Adam Scott was a ""breakout star"" of 2022 because of his incredible starring role in Severance (although that wasn't as widely watched). Or Jennifer Coolidge, bc of her role in The White Lotus and personality.

Second, Pascal is very much an actor/celebrity ""of the pop cultural moment,"" not only with starring roles in two major tv series connected to major franchises but also a huge, dedicated fan following that goes beyond his acting performances to his personality, a fanbase that only intensified with his role in The Mandalorian and now The Last Of Us. This certainly isn't the first time he has had a media/cultural moment - I know he did a lot of major interviews and such during Narcos and The Mandalorian. But Pascal is once again having a moment, and it feels especially zeitgeist-y and meme-y, as reflected and reinforced by his hosting SNL. And being a guest on Graham Norton.

Finally, as I said, the release of The Last Of Us and the third season of The Mandalorian at the same time feels like a culmination of success from an actor who has progressively acted in bigger and bigger roles since Game of Thrones. I mean, how many actors are starring in not one but TWO of the biggest, most popular series connected to two unrelated major franchises - Star Wars and The Last Of Us video game - which are being released *at the same time.*

Anyway, I thought the article was a surprisingly well-researched - yet brief - biographical profile of an actor...and without a mention of ""internet daddy"" lol"
The Trial,"And he had a big part in the Kingsman sequel. Not on the same scale as the others, but it was the 2nd thing I saw him in and loved it"
The Trial,"It’s because The Last of Us is in full circlejerk right now. It’s a fine show, but the internet is blowing it up acting like it’s some groundbreaking masterpiece with revolutionary performances, which it is not in my opinion."
The Trial,Orphan black wasn't a popular show though
The Trial,Nah. He'd make a better Burt.
The Trial,"Really? The few clips I saw on YouTube looked good, but it wasn't the whole show. The whole kiss ""swerve"" bit was a bit dicey when he and Helen Mirren actually tried it. idk how they felt about it, but I always feel weird when talk show guest get involved in any sort of touchy-feely or sexual shenanigans (bc it's hard to consent on live talk show), unless they are actually v close and touchy-feel-y irl. Other than that it looked good to me, maybe buzzed but he just struck me as his usual goofy, gregarious self. But sometimes I don't notice until it's pointed out to me."
The Trial,It's not The Mandalorian or Game of Thrones but it was big enough to win her an Emmy AND get a spinoff.
The Trial,"I could see him as Burt lol...Oh god they need to pick a Country Start to be his wife too, we need to keep the joke up.

Maybe Michael Gross could play his Grandpa in a cameo"
The Trial,"Idk, there were some ok moments, but overall it was just awkward. Thankfully it didn't get too off the rails, but it was teetering on the edge. To be fair, I haven't watched a ton of his interviews, so maybe this is how he always acts, it just stood out to me as a regular Graham Norton viewer. I agree, I get really uncomfortable when the guests get too touchy feely with people they've just met. Funnily enough, Evangeline Lilly recently did just that to Danny Dyer in a chat show, touching his ear. It's so not cool."
The Trial,"Haha well I'm still holding judgement until I watch the show (if I ever get the chance). I would watch other interviews and the SNL sketches - he comes off as very gregarious, happy, goofy/cheeky (not in a problematic way), open and charming in a way that I could imagine coming off as tipsy if you only watched his shows, in which he plays more serious/intense/stoic roles.

I love the [interview he did with longtime friend and fellow actor Oscar Isaac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stLw-2Ob8xQ) 3 years ago for a Wired Autocomplete Interview (which is not live). Actually they seem kind of wired in that interview, if you know what i mean lol. They are very touchy-feely but they are good friends. Oscar gives Pedro a wet willy, which to me would be a line too far but I guess they're cool lol. I mean the touchy stuff is also a power dynamic/age/gender thing."
The Trial,I really enjoyed this show.  Neil Patrick Harris was perfectly cast.
The Trial,"Oh well, at least they called witnesses."
The Trial,I loved the Wes Anderson meets Tim Burton style of this show.
The Trial,One of the most bizarre shows that I saw on TV in the last years. Various absurdities from that triggered interesting discussions in r/AskScienceFiction
The Trial,"I’m gonna say it.

This is the best show Netflix has ever made."
The Trial,The ending of that episode was crazy. I legitimately thought the show was ending right there.
The Trial,It may seem like Count Olaf will be finally brought to justice...  But why would any viewers think that they could really trust us?
The Trial,[deleted]
The Trial,"His camp acting in this series is hilarious. The best part of the whole series. Camp villians are great, my favorite will always be The Emperor. https://youtu.be/05_HDCwgD28"
The Trial,I would love for them to adapt the prequel series All the Wrong Questions for Netflix!
The Trial,NPH is the best!!!
The Trial,[deleted]
The Trial,"NPH and Patrick Warburton seemed like the weirdest fits to me before the show started, but once I started watching it they quickly became my favorites."
The Trial,Too soon man!
The Trial,With just a dash of Edward Gorey
The Trial,"Over the course of the seasons I'd been trying to think of a way to describe the aesthetic of this show. You sir, have mailed it. Thank you."
The Trial,"That’s Barry Sonnenfeld for you. His films have this very weird vibe to them, he’s very good at juxtaposing crazy characters and fictional universes in the weird world (Men in Black, Addams Family) and having the experience he did with the Coen Brothers helped too"
The Trial,"They managed to capture the utter absurdity of the book world perfectly. In a world where nothing makes sense, everything makes sense."
The Trial,"It's certainly up there. It's one of the best book adaptations ever, too - it really captures the tone of the books and incorporating a lot of the supplemental material so the story actually feels complete."
The Trial,"It's definitely between this and Bojack, imo. Both had phenomenal finales."
The Trial,I really agree. One of the greatest TV adaptations I've seen.
The Trial,Dark and Narcos would like to have a word with you
The Trial,"Mindhunter, Dark (if you count an imported German show as “Netflix”) and BoJack Horseman are Netflix’s best offerings, IMO.  Also really love GLOW and Big Mouth, plus their miniseries “Unbelievable” from last fall."
The Trial,even better than dark and ozark?
The Trial,not so difficult since Netflix seems to prefer quantity over quality.
The Trial,"It adapts more stories than the film in a longer amount of time, so you have more detail and characterization than the film which shoved 3 books into 1 film. Jim Carey is a lot better at the super serious parts, but both him and NPH covered the insane ridiculous quirks of Olaf while being menacing. I think this is an overall better adaptation as they were able to flesh out the children and Olaf more. Absolutely worth the watch."
The Trial,"Most people seem to like it better than the movie.

I don't, but most people do. So, I'd go with their opinions over mine. I think the show is awful."
The Trial,"There's been rumors that they're doing exactly that. Hopefully Daniel Handler is involved again.

Also, I wonder if they would rework the story so Olaf is narrating his own backstory parallel to Snicket's . I just don't see them not involving NPH at all."
The Trial,"Ends of shows?

 The video title is 'The Penultimate Peril' - should be obvious this isn't the end."
The Trial,"I was particularly intrigued by the fact that all adults show various degrees of insanity and/or retardation, and perhaps some very specific neurological conditions like face blindness. Only the children are sane and rational."
The Trial,Absolutely. I felt like a part of my childhood was completed when I finished it. Phenomenal!
The Trial,"The funny thing is that I'm still bitter about the way the books ended all these years later, but I loved the final episode of the show. They really didn't change that much, but you can tell they went in with the goal to give more closure than in the books and it went a long way."
The Trial,"better than ozark definitely, that show is not exceptional at anything it's just fine"
The Trial,That could certainly be a neat new way to tell the story! Honestly I'd be happy with them even attempting to adapt it!
The Trial,"Not ALL of them, how dare you insult Jacqueline and Kit. 

But that's what was so cool about the books. Slowly learning that children sometimes have to rely on themselves, to the point where when they're offered help they flatout refuse it."
The Trial,"That was actually a major point of the books, where they’re showing that adults don’t know everything and children should learn to think for themselves. Of course, taken to extreme absurdity as all things in ASOUE"
The Trial,It's a show for kids that gives kids a lot of credit and it's a show about kids who never get enough credit. It really is a wonderful concept that's executed masterfully.
The Trial,I worked on set for The Austere Academy episodes. Pretty certain this was very deliberate.
The Trial,Aasifs character was pretty damn good.
The Trial,"There's some ""inversion of expectation"" going on too; in both the novels and the series, any character is Jewish until proven otherwise (a deliberate commentary on the British/WASPy quality of most children's and young adult literature at the time Handler was writing). 

The TV series then takes it a step further, where nearly any character whose sexuality is not stated outright is assumed to be queer rather than heteronormative."
The Trial,What...ozark story is so good
The Trial,"How so? There's really nothing that stands out, it just is"
The Trial,It was awesome seeing the original cast in the trial. That surprised me.
The Trial,[deleted]
The Trial,"All the cameos were so good, i can't believe they brought Wesley"
The Trial,"Tilda's delivery of, ""what is this? Is this lunch?"" is why she's the best. I was crying laughing."
The Trial,"Did I catch them all:

1. Tilda - Only Lovers Left Alive
2. Paul - Buffy
3. Deacon, Viago, Vladislav - What We Do In The Shadows (Film)
4. Evan - True Blood
5. Wesley - Blade
6. Baby - original to the show
7. Danny - From Dusk Til Dawn
8. Dave Bautista (the prisoner vampire) - original to the show
9. Kristen Schaal - original to the show"
The Trial,This show has quickly become one of my absolute favourites. I've already watched every episode twice at least.
The Trial,Here's a good interview with Taika and Jermaine about the episode and the casting https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/
The Trial,Nandor / Gizmo friendship is the best.
The Trial,[Mirror](https://streamable.com/dh50x) for those outside of the US and Canada.
The Trial,"Loved seeing the original cast. This is such a great show. It's the new ""The Office"" for me."
The Trial,"I read in an interview with the show's creators that Cate Blanchett wanted to be on the council in the episode and they were like, ""Welllllll... you've never played a vampire, have you? Come back to us once you have."""
The Trial,I think Clem Fandango is a vampire.
The Trial,"> The uploader has not made this video available in your country. 

Yes, thank you, and fuck you too FX."
The Trial,The screaming baby call back was the best part of the episode. That was hilarious. Such an amazing episode as a whole though with all the guests
The Trial,I can’t believe it took me hearing about this scene to watch this show. I’ve never laughed so hard at anything before.
The Trial,I was cracking up during this scene. The only way it really could have been better is if Paul Reubens was missing an arm.
The Trial,"I honestly did not like the movie at all, bit this was super funny. I'll watch this show I guess."
The Trial,I expected the show to actually be in the same universe as the film and that at some point the original cast would cameo but I wasn’t expecting it to be like this.
The Trial,I knew it was coming when I saw one of the robed guys doing Deacon's [erotic dance.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KyUmAOtGa0)
The Trial,"Imagine being 90 years old and still stuck in a high chair. Man, that's rough."
The Trial,Such a great call back to the running joke from earlier in the episode.
The Trial,Wesley Snipes as a vampire hunter was amazing
The Trial,some motherfuckers are always trying to ice skate uphill
The Trial,"Alexandra Henrikson as Vasilika the Defiler  
Ejyp Johnson as The Dreaded Fayard  

I believe both are original to the show.  
&nbsp;  

Dave Bautista's character was named Garrett, Garrett the Vampire."
The Trial,Honestly didn't realise they were all vampires in different films until I read the article afterwards.
The Trial,Evan Rachel-Wood was in there too wasn't she?
The Trial,Man I need to rewatch Buffy I have no idea who Paul is
The Trial,"Thank you, I couldn't remember where Paul was from"
The Trial,"I saw this before and it’s good read. I remember thinking, when I first saw this scene, “how the hell did they get all these people?!”.  Then it clicked in my head, Jermaine has a pretty active career and Taika is a rising star of a director and realized “no wonder they they got all these people!”"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I'd like to reiterate, fuck Caillou."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,This was a great read.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Delta state was the shit!
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,It was on both actually
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,This is a bad idea
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Still too much *Teen Titans Go!*
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,[deleted]
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I was wondering why *Steven Universe: The Movie* wasn't showing up on 6/2...
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,so what would be a better idea to you?
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,ironically enough people here think there should be even more of it
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"it's just to begin with,and Adult Swim no longer needs so many hours since in a few years most Fox shows won't even be able to air on Adult Swim anymore. And the New episodes @ 7 thing will change weekly throughout the month. the other three weeks will have Craig of the creek,Victor and Valentino,and Mao Mao. OK K.O. will show it's final two episodes on September 13."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Labor day schedule stays the same,this schedule covers the rest of the week."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,more scooby doo
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,[deleted]
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,was that supposed to be funny?
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"would you rather have reruns from just 2 shows 80% of the day? be logical. and We Bare Bears isn't on Cartoon Network for a month now,I'm planning to give it an hour for weekdays in October."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,this entire post is a joke no?
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,[deleted]
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"your entire account seems like a joke and you can't take anything seriously. I'm trying to help fix a dying system of media,maybe you hate shows that came before Gumball,or maybe you're just not a fan of variety,but that's you. this is my opinion."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"look,Cartoon Network doesn't want the new shows in general right now. Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes are already announced to come back on that Tuesday,so they desperately need an alternative that isn't just Gumball anymore."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,That's not going to happen. Waner Bros will beat Scooby to death to make money. 
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"[Oh, so you haven't seen this yet?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6630KtDWPg)"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"They are starting a hanna barbera cinematic universe.  Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Jetsons, Yogi Bear, Tom and Jerry, Smurfs, Johnny Quest and Hong Kong Phooey are all gonna team up Avengers style. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"So what your saying is theyre making it like the original series. Basically complaining about what theyve always done,"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I'm excited for this new Scooby Doo series. Modernizing Scooby Doo seems sweet. Reminds me of the old specials Scooby Doo and The Harlem Globetrotters etc.

If The Episodes have fresh new relevant topical storylines like Living on Mars mystery then this show may be great."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,It always makes me laugh to see grown adults give in-depth opinions about shows intended for 8 year olds.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I don't really mind a new Scooby Doo show, but I just learned about this new one and I'm very worried. They went from the incredible Mystery Incorporated to Be Cool, Scooby Doo, which is just horrible and from what I've seen has absolutely no redeeming factors. And this new one, from the one picture I've seen, looks exactly the same as Be Cool. 

I usually don't like judging shows without seeing them first, but i really am worried about this now.

You'd think they'd learn after how great Mystery Inc was and how terrible be cool was that they should make the next one more like Mystery Inc. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Check out Mike Tyson Mysteries. It uses the framework of Scooby Doo and is a surprisingly good show. 
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"No, Freddy Prince isn’t getting any younger.  Take advantage of his baby face now."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I guess that answers my question |:(
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Oh no
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I am opposed to anyone other than Hayley Kiyoko playing a live action Velma
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I could've sworn that was one of those fake trailers for fake movies you see on youtube with repurposed footage from other movies
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,i know it exist its pretty much shamalan version of scooby doo
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,If you could murder me now that would be great
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Talking about Live Action, I'd like a Live Action show with the whole Scooby Doo gang on The CW."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"You joke, but damn would I love to see Yogi, Scooby and Fred Flintstone team up to take down an intergalactic threat."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Funny you mention that since a new Smurfs animated series is coming in 2019 or 2020 and made in Belgium.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Most likely
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,">If The Episodes have fresh new relevant topical storylines like Living on Mars mystery then this show may be great.


Possibly"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Also sums up reactions to the new Thundercats
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Dude Be Cool was good. It has my favorite version of Daphne. Yeah it followed Mystery Inc and be honest no show could compete with that amount of awesome.


 It was a more comedic and retro-styled scooby series and its designs got the job done ( it set itself apart from the other scooby projects at the time).


It was something different, doesnt mean it was bad"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,">  They went from the incredible Mystery Incorporated

I just want to chime in and say Mystery Incorporated is one of the best animated shows to be on TV and is the pinnacle of the franchise. I can not gush about it enough. It's the greatest interpretation of the series and characters. Between a Freddy obsessed with his masculinity and suppressing his emotions until he can only express himself through trap making, to alpha Velma who is so damn thirsty. And the idea of the town hating the gang because they want to capitalize on the Monsters as a tourist attraction until they are proven to be fakes is brilliant. It manages to flip Scooby Doo on it's head while being a love letter to the franchise. There are so many things I want to say to get people to watch the show but it would ruin some surprises you would never think you would see in a kids show. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Be Cool was more like the original rather than Mystery Incorporated and not too lolrandumb like TTG. Apart from the bad art, it's very clever and humorous. You should see the series instead of judging. Definitely an underrated show.


> And this new one, from the one picture I've seen, looks exactly the same as Be Cool

Looks like a Be Cool screencap. It's not yet confirmed that the next series is with this art style."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,She was good but she's old to play a high schooler.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I thought it was a porno
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Im joking a little about the lineup, but it is actually happening. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,It also happened fifty years ago. They made a ton of movies and show with all the hanna barbara characters.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Oh, well, that changes things!"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,The laffalympics were real and amazing. 
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I made my parents rent Yogi Bear and the Spruce Goose all the time as a kid. Also loved Yogi’s First Christmas or whatever it was actually called. 
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Wacky races
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I was disappointed in the writing.  It was like they wanted to get the characters up to the level of the original characters in terms of hunting which was weird.  They should be discovering these things slowly.  They didn’t let the plot develop naturally, just had one guy dropped in a group that n owns how to do everything already, and it was done very awkwardly.  This could have been good, hopefully it changes but I don’t know where they go since they know everything about the world already."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Too bad it will get canceled once the season wraps up.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,">I was disappointed

Same and the acting wasn't coming 5o the rescuing either"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I think I'm an adult, and they shouldn't try to tailor the show toward any of my thoughts, because I'm not the target audience. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Eh, I thought Be Cool was a huge let down after Mystery Inc., and really didn't like the animation style, so I'm a big fan of this return to form. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I want a live action Scooby Doo show on Netflix
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I disagree, I actually want the celebrities to be current even if it dates the show because it's an interesting window towards the current generation, just like how Mama Cass and Don Knotts were 50 years ago."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I think it could be fun, Scooby Doo was very entertaining in the past when it does guest stars (or at least so bad it's good like that Scooby Doo & Kiss movie). I also like the return of the classic designs, getting rid of the awful Regular Show/Family Guy-like designs from Be Cool."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Dated as they may be, Scooby Doo meeting Sonny and Cher, Mamma Cass (of the Mammas and the Papas), the Addams Family, Batman and Robin, all we're classics. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Big fan of the look love the more classic designs, curious to see how this will be, I wasn’t a fan of be cool Scooby doo but I love Scooby doo overall so I’m excited "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,His last name is Gaylord?
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Can't wait for the Cardi B episode.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,What happen to be cool? I liked that show. It felt like it was barely on.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Another new Scooby Doo?
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,It looks kind of like the supernatural episode from last year.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Love this return to a classic look. Be Cool was awful. 
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I didn't know Be Cool was cancelled. Is this gonna be like the old show where they had a guest each episode both real and fictional? One episode would have the Adams Family and another a team of basketball players.

The designs are ok, you made it sound like it'd be something radical like Be Cool. Anyway, I'm glad they are now so comfortable with the classic artstyle and clothes of the characters, especially Fred, ever since Zombie Island and they never knew how to dress him since nobody wore ascots anymore."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I like how it's not that lame Steven Universe style like the new Thundercats.
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"So they're basically reimagning the Movies series (1972-4) for a new generation, but likely in a shorter format. Ok, cool. But watch, if CN doesn't like it, they'll mistreat it like they did the last series."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I want A Pup Named Scooby Doo to come back
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"Well, Be Cool looked like absolute shit so it's definitely an improvement..."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"What's this, an art style consistent with the property's iconography?  What blasphemy! Begone thee trash, mine eyes must only be exposed to crudely, stylized corruptions of all that I have ever known!"
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Looks like the first guest is Mothmonsterman from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,[deleted]
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"This certainly looks better than the last one, Be Cool Scooby Doo. Mimicking the original look is a step in the right direction. "
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,I'm a 30 y.o. adult male and chuckled at 'Gaylord'....
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,"I think there is a place for more mature Scooby Doo material, like the Scooby-Doo Supernatural episode. However, it shouldn't replace the kids stuff, it should co-exist with the kids stuff."
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,This is a suspiciously mature opinion. Are you sure you're in the right place?
Whats New Scooby-Doo?,Why not? Theres an appetite for it and money to be made from it. I dont see the issue with. It making one to target adults seeing as the people who grew up on it are at least in their 50s now.
State of Happiness,Glad they didn't try and redeem Tommy. He had a fucked up view of the world from the start obviously and it would've felt like a cop out if they tried to change that. Amazing finale.
State of Happiness,"It was incredible, just like pretty much every episode in the entire series. Maybe it'll never get much traction outside of the UK but it's one of the very best dramas I've ever seen, and with possibly the strongest lead performance in anything ever (and a +1 for Siobahn Finneran too). 

Probably sounds hyperbolic but I think I'm serious with that."
State of Happiness,A great finale. The scene in the kitchen was electric.
State of Happiness,"Catherines assessment of the showdown between her and the shitpot Tommy Lee was amazing:  

""We’ve had another bit of a tussle. I won, obviously, but I think I might’ve singed one of your crochet blankets”"
State of Happiness,Will get downvoted but thought it was average. Bit of an anticlimax after the good episodes that went before it. Appreciate I will probably be in the minority.
State of Happiness,"The final episode was definitely rushed but I still enjoyed it quite a bit, loved the final kitchen scene, didn’t like the sub-plots conclusion wasn’t particularly well written or enticing. Also we didn’t see much of the side cast for the finale which screams pacing issues. 

Either way enjoyed the show and season definitely doesn’t stand up to the quality of the first two seasons but still still an enjoyable season of telly."
State of Happiness,"Story with Catherine and Tommy was incredible and done to perfection.

However I do feel like the B stories were wrapped up in a few lines at the end - the teacher not going down for murder but for being a nonce was pretty out of nowhere. I feel like those stories should have been wrapped up in the previous episode and this should have been all about Tommy and Catherine. Would have liked to see Ryan's reaction to Tommy being dead too."
State of Happiness,"Alongside all the many, many acting plaudits, this was an absolute masterclass in how to tie up a finale.

Pretty much all loose ends were sorted in a realistic and tonally perfect way."
State of Happiness,"Is this the lady from "" the accident""?"
State of Happiness,"The car scene reminded me of a (less graphic) version of the car scene from I Saw the Devil, complete with a quite fancy rotation shot of the car.  Might be a stretch but interesting to know if the directors/writers ever saw that. 

Overall I thought the series was really good for the TLR/Ryan side of things which had a lot of time to play out.  But all the side stories though felt a bit odd as they seemed to be indicative of being more significant than they were, then everything just all wrapped up with a sentence or two."
State of Happiness,"Thought it was okay. Some of the dialogue is bizarrely clunky and the whole B plot was an utter waste of time. The really bad acting from Faisal and Joanna didn’t help… 

The kid who played Ryan was the real standout this season. They got very lucky that he ended up being such a good actor. 

Having said that, I don’t think this season really did much at all. It meandered and added nothing beyond season 2. Also don’t understand why we didn’t get much pay-off for Ryan despite him and Catherine being the main focus of the season. We didn’t see him react to TLR being dead? No conversation between them afterwards? 

It was wrapped up too neatly. Fair play though, people seem to love this show."
State of Happiness,Sarah Lancashire is a goddamn goddess. Looking forward to watching the rest of s3.
State of Happiness,"""One of TV's Greatest Trilogies""?

The show is a lot of fun, but for god sakes it isn't all that."
State of Happiness,"Felt a bit too ""written"" for me with every little thread tied up nicely but at least they didn't show everything and some of it was told not shown. 

It still felt a bit ""and they all lived happily ever after"" 

Still entertaining though."
State of Happiness,Probably the best drama from UK in 21st century
State of Happiness,"i enjoyed it overall as a show, season 1 and 2 were real standouts but the finale was a bit underwhelming

i still can’t get past how insufferable Ryan’s character was and his love for Tommy despite everything he did to his family, didn’t make a lot of sense"
State of Happiness,Anyone know when/where this will air in the US?
State of Happiness,Loved the first two seasons - highly looking forward to the final one.
State of Happiness,Can someone tell me who played the secretary in the last epsiode please
State of Happiness,Solid show. I have a problem with the obvious misandry of the thing though. What do you think?
State of Happiness,"To American viewers, this series is incredible and should properly be given all the credit for inspiring Mare Of Eastown. But to savvy UK viewers, Hapyy Valley is hardly noteworthy in an excellent field of Nordic Noirs led by Broadchurch, Shetland, The Killing, The Bridge, etc."
State of Happiness,I forgot about this show. Hopefully Netflix has it up soon
State of Happiness,Man I really need to watch this series. I watched the first season back when it aired almost 10 years ago but haven't had a chance to watch the other 2. Remember loving it so it's probably worth to revisit season 1 too. Glad it's ended on a strong note!
State of Happiness,https://herahearsitall.wordpress.com/2023/02/06/i-feel-sorry-for-tommy-lee-royce/
State of Happiness,Phenomenal performances all round and an entirely satisfying ending. It was everything I hoped for. Sally’s writing was pure brilliance and that kitchen scene with Tommy was electric. Best series I think I’ve ever watched and an incredibly well written inspiring female lead
State of Happiness,I'm in the US and love British tv series. This is one of the absolute best. I'm glad it went out will.
State of Happiness,I did like that they let him show his perspective and say how deluded he was. He genuinely thought that he was a good man despite his actions.
State of Happiness,"In a way, I think they *did* redeem him--to a realistic extent.

He had a moment of clarity and understanding when he saw the photo albums, and realized that his hate-fueled perspective on Catherine wasn't the whole picture. 

He came to that conclusion based on an authentic desire to see Ryan happy.

But... of course, he was still a sociopathic narcissist, who was unable to view himself as anything besides a misunderstood victim, and that wasn't about to change.

The kitchen table exchange contained so much insight into the true difference between adulthood (Catherine) and immaturity/childhood (TLR). 

If felt *so* right to me when she called him ""a fucked-up, frightened, damaged, deluded, nasty little toddler-brain in a big man's body."" 

She sees him *exactly* for what he is, which is in many ways pitiable--but also, fundamentally irredeemable beyond the sliver of understanding that he gleaned from the albums."
State of Happiness,"Love both of them, but after seeing James Norton on Graham Norton the other week his transformation into TLR is pretty spectacular."
State of Happiness,"This has quickly shot up to being one of my favorite series. I'm in the US and started watching last month so I had a nice lead up. It'll be airing here in May, and so I expect there will be more love coming it's way."
State of Happiness,American viewers has already seen it without realizing it. Happy Valley was shamelessly plagiarized and adapted into Mare Of Eastown.
State of Happiness,"> Probably sounds hyperbolic but I think I'm serious with that.

Not at all. Lancaster is an absolute gem."
State of Happiness,"Agreed. An absolute masterclass.

Hope it doesn’t get ruined with a US version like Gavin and Stacey, Happy Valley can never be replicated."
State of Happiness,I’m American and this is hyperbole I can get behind. I don’t have as high as that but I get it. Pretty close for me.
State of Happiness,"Can confirm as an Australian, that barely any of my friends watch this, nor have they listened to my repeated requests to give it a try since Season 1 premiered, ah well their loss.

What an incredible way for a masterpiece of a show to go out."
State of Happiness,I loved the childishness of it lol
State of Happiness,Love the series and the two sisters but I have to agree with you. Especially considering Royce’s escape from the three guys. The conclusion felt a bit flat to me.
State of Happiness,"Right I am not sure if I am imagining it, but when Ryan is talking in the police station about his teacher it has a flashback of their conversation in the school gym.  That was early in the season where the teacher started trying to connect with him.  In the flashback as Ryan walks away they make it look like the teacher is checking him out.  I don’t remember that checking out bit happening earlier in the series, and thought ‘did they just add this so they could chuck in that he was a nonce at the end’."
State of Happiness,"> being a nonce was pretty out of nowhere

It was hinted at a couple of episodes ago by Joanna when she was trying to get Faisal to help her. She said that every so often Rob would start trying to break a kid down so that he could build him up again and we also learned from the grandparents that Joanna was one of his former  students and that she abandoned her plan to go to university to marry him."
State of Happiness,"This has to be sarcasm. There were **so many** loose ends left untied. They were hardly realistic and the ones that were, were only given about 20 seconds to sum up an entire seasons worth of storylines. Faisal’s character arc died by the last episode. The teach was suddenly a child molester. Catherine went from being Royce’s sworn enemy to someone he “forgave” and wanted to move on from - despite being a literal psychopath void of empathy. Ivan’s character arc was just killed with his arrest. I might be in the minority but a hundred ex Machina’s to sum up a series spanning 10 years is hardly what I’d call a “masterclass” in writing. Season 1 brilliant. Season 2 shaky. Season 3 - started with hope and fell flat on its face by the finale."
State of Happiness,"Yes, [Sarah Lancashire](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0484104/?ref_=tt_rv_t0)."
State of Happiness,He was eh! He'll be in something in future I'm sure. Great cast overall tbh
State of Happiness,"Now try [Last Tango in Halifax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Tango_in_Halifax), same writer, Sarah is gorgeous as a school headmistress of a tony private school. There’s also Derek Jacobi and Nicola Walker to tempt you. Fantastic series, more about family relationships with no murders."
State of Happiness,You’re having a laugh.
State of Happiness,"I thought Ryan was perfectly played - he's a teenager, and hat's how teenagers are."
State of Happiness,"> his love for Tommy despite everything he did to his family

The show made very clear that Catherine was keeping a lot of the fucked up stuff Tommy did from Ryan, basically just telling him that she'd have to trust him when she says he's irredeemable. Keeping Ryan in the dark meant that he wasn't sure if Tommy truly was evil or if he was just someone that had made some really bad choices but was looking to change."
State of Happiness,You can catch in on HBO under the name Mare Of Eastown.
State of Happiness,"May on AMC+ / Acorn TV / BBC America.

AMC+ currently has S1 and S2, as does Crackle."
State of Happiness,HV is so far above those other shows it's not even a contest. Broadchurch ffs!  What a joke.
State of Happiness,The Killing as in the US version? Strongly disagree with including that show in the list. That show became so convoluted and ridiculous. The only good thing about it in the end were the two main leads.
State of Happiness,No Netflix lost the rights and it will be here either on AMC+ or BBC America.
State of Happiness,"Netflix dropped *Happy Valley* in 2020 (the fools). They still have *Last Tango in Halifax,* though.

*Happy Valley* is now up on AMC+ and S3 will be on AMC+ / AcornTV / BBC America in May.

S1 and S2 are also up on Crackle if you can deal with ads."
State of Happiness,I think they showed enough to show that had circumstances been different he'd probably had been a decent person but didn't make it obvious enough to lose the fact he's a horrible cunt
State of Happiness,theres like nothing similar about it other than the fact the main cast is a troubled middle aged women detective
State of Happiness,*Lancashire
State of Happiness,"Ohhh is in the states and if so, where? Love this show"
State of Happiness,"Mare of Easttown is essentially a US remake of Happy Valley and that was a pretty solid show.

It's only really our comedy that doesn't translate great to the US."
State of Happiness,"Nah, nah, the US remake of a Sally Wainwright-written piece has already happened and it was *Unforgiven* (currently on Britbox US) that got warped out of shape to become a Netflix Sandra Bullock thing ([*The Unforgiveable*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNUjx7LZoiU)). And as these things go, it wasn't that bad.

Not like all those crappy US remakes of Lynda LaPlante's *Widows.* (eyeroll).

And US remake don't **always** suck (*All in the Family, The Office, Ghosts*)."
State of Happiness,"I think it would have benefited by having the last episode broken up into two. They could have dealt better with the pharmacist and teacher, and I would have liked to have seen the downfall of the Knesovic brother who was trying to get into local politics."
State of Happiness,Yeah that seemed out of place to me
State of Happiness,"Nonce or no nonce, it really felt like lazy writing for a highly-anticipated season finale. 

-What was the conclusion to the teachers character arc?

-What was the conclusion to Faisal’s character arc?

-What was the conclusion to the Ivan storyline? 

-What was Ryan’s view of it all by the end? 

-TLR was hinted at still being alive, was that the end of his character all together? Was this closure for Catherine despite him still being alive and likely trying to contact Ryan again?"
State of Happiness,"Have to say, literally no idea why anyone would disagree with you. I was actually happy with the finale but also completely agree with the points you’ve made. I’d be hard pressed to find plot/messaging relevant reasons for including Faisal’s story. Maybe more commentary on male privilege? Regardless, it certainly was NOT well executed. Ending the entire subplot on a throwaway line from Catherine was certainly a decision. I like where everyone ultimately ended up; Ryan being a smart lad who realizes/appreciates what he has, Catherine being less cynical, everyone else being relatively happy in their stations in life… but pretty unbelievable how they all got there. Tommy saw a few photos which somehow reinvigorated his faith in humanity? Somehow his love for Becky was real and sincere, as much as it could be, for a narcissistic psychopath? While the showdown in the kitchen was without doubt a master class in acting, it’s hard for me to parse the message behind it all. Are psychopaths redeemable or is their humanity ultimately pointless/meaningless because they can’t forge human connection in the same way we can? Loved the show, so, so glad for the happy ending, but definitely not flawless, not by a long shot."
State of Happiness,"sorry to dig up an 11 day old comment but

same writer > sarah lancashire > nicola walker

it's like that wrestling meme where he gets increasingly excited. thanks for dropping this recommendation"
State of Happiness,Not a chance that it’s above The Bridge!
State of Happiness,Thanks for the heads up!
State of Happiness,I wonder when.
State of Happiness,"I got that sense too. At the end of the season I just felt sorry for him. Both a victim of his circumstances and a horrible person with a completely warped view of his entire world. Both can be true. 

I also like how they showed how violence doesn't pay. It leads to misery and unhappiness"
State of Happiness,You conveniently omitted them both being the primary caretaker of a grandchild whose parent passed away from suicide.
State of Happiness,I think seasons 1 and 2 are on Netflix and season 3 will be there soon
State of Happiness,"Ad-free/sub, S1 and S2 are [on AMC+](https://www.amcplus.com/shows/happy-valley--1031145) and S3 will be on AMC+ / AcornTV / BBC America in May.

FAST (free, ad-supported streaming tv), S1 and S2 are [up on Crackle](https://www.crackle.com/details/3b61b1a7-a431-4a3d-b98d-bff8ffcd21f7/happy-valley)."
State of Happiness,">It's only really our comedy that doesn't translate great to the US.

I dunno. Remember when they tried to do a US remake of Broadchurch?"
State of Happiness,"Yeah I’d definitely agree with you on that, Mare of Easttown was superb."
State of Happiness,Agreed. The pharmacist and teacher storylines were wrapped up a little too quickly for my taste too. I also would have preferred a better showdown between Cawood and Royce. I’m going to miss Cawood. She’s such a badass.
State of Happiness,"I liked it the way it was, it made it clear that this show was never really about the Knezevics"
State of Happiness,"> What was the conclusion to the teachers character arc?

That he was charged (and likely would be found guilty), he mainly served as a parallel to TLR, both men didn't directly kill the woman that they ""loved"" but it was their abusive actions that led to it, and neither wants to admit it. 

> What was the conclusion to Faisal’s character arc?

Likely arrested, I wouldn't have minded a scene showing that but it would have been hard to show since realistically he's nowhere near ready to be charged come the end of the episode, there would need to be a lot of policework to get to that point but now that the police know about him I doubt he's smart enough to get away with it. 

> What was the conclusion to the Ivan storyline?

He was arrested with his brother at the start of the episode, given there was a bag of stolen money in their flat that was recovered they're almost certainly getting sent down. Their boss is a bigger question mark, it's unlikely Tommy's testimony alone would bring him down. 

> What was Ryan’s view of it all by the end?

I agree there should have been a Ryan scene.

> TLR was hinted at still being alive

Quite the opposite. Whilst he was in a coma after the arrest Catherine received a text near the end (I think it was while she was at her daughter's grave) saying that he'd died in hospital."
State of Happiness,*miles above*
State of Happiness,"Nope. *Happy Valley* left Netflix in 2020, iirc.  Just about the time *Last Tango in Halifax S5* (also written by Wainwright and starring Sarah Lancashire) was airing on the BBC. 

It's living on AMC+ ad-free and that's where S3 will be landing in May (also AcornTV and BBC America). If you can deal with ads, S1 and S2 are also up on Crackle at the moment."
State of Happiness,"I'm not saying that attempts to adapt UK drama are universally successful, just that it's not an inherently poor idea like it tends to be with UK comedy."
State of Happiness,"Ahhh okay, I missed the TLR text so that’s one of them put to rest. I can’t lie, the others all sound like speculation though (which is sort of my point). There were big storylines in the final season left on cliffhangers."
State of Happiness,"The original version of the Bridge? It’s a masterpiece. Incredible characters and engaging stories the whole way throughout. Just shows how different people’s tastes can be, I guess. I don’t agree with any of their other shouts, but The Bridge sits in a different tier imo"
State of Happiness,"i'm the dude playing the summer island dude, disguised as a targaryen dude."
State of Happiness,No one bitched about the rich black guy in GoT
State of Happiness,Really? You racist for thinking it's stupid to cast a black guy for a role that have been established to be super super white with everything blond?
State of Happiness,[removed]
State of Happiness,its all so tiresome
State of Happiness,It's a little weird to have one black guy on your small council and not be constantly talking about it
State of Happiness,"Spoilers for the show/book

Him being black doesn’t ruin the show, but the race of his son and the race of the Strong that Rhaenyra sleeps with need to be the same. We’re already shown that Strong’s brother is white, so how people are gonna know Rhaenyra kids are Strongs and not her gay husbands (the husband being Corlys’ son)"
State of Happiness,"I think you can disagree with the casting while not being racist. People just like to lump those two groups together so they can silence one group and bask in the outrage. Corlys Velaryon being black just seems so far-fetched and obvious pandering considering everything we know about the Velaryon and Targaryen families. Like these are the whitest characters in the lore. Known for being pale as fuck, obsessed with pure blood lines, and tragically inbred. Basically practicing Medieval eugenics."
State of Happiness,"I honestly find this rhetoric totally baffling. There were black and MENA people in Game of Thrones, in all kinds of roles. Did we just all forget it or what."
State of Happiness,10k upvotes? This has to be a marketing tool. Which sucks for legit issues.
State of Happiness,Americans are obsessed with black people.
State of Happiness,"So I'm assuming this ""actor/director/etc slams racist/sexist/etc backlash"" is just part of the basic marketing package these days right? Seems about as predicable as trailers and posters lately."
State of Happiness,The fake racist marketing ploy is getting so old and desensitizes people to legitimate racism when it gets lost in the sea of articles about racism
State of Happiness,Cue the “slam racist viewers” marketing ploy.
State of Happiness,Tolkien black guy
State of Happiness,I don't know why they don't adapt the black characters from the book and call it a day.
State of Happiness,"Two things can be true at once

1. This actor is good at the role he is playing
2. His skin is inconsistent with the lore of the fantasy world they are portraying

That's all. But nice flex adding the ""rich"" part lol"
State of Happiness,"As someone who isn't anglo I find it offensive to trivialise people in this condescending token diversity hire for roles the author of the original material didn't intend the character to be a person of color.

The fault isn't the fans of the literature who know the character was realistically white.

If GRR Martin wrote about this multi-racial Targaryens and you had black, asian and whites described in the books there wouldn't be a single fan of the literature complain about him being cast.  Nobody complained about movies where Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, Forest Whitaker, Laurence Fishburne, Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, etc or the numerous others who played roles of characters that weren't white.

I hate when actors lash out at fans for objecting to diversity hiring and make it out like they are racist.  They object to having a character blackwashed for ""inclusion"", much like people should object if they re-make a black movie and change races in that for the sake of diversity.

If Hollywood wants to be more diverse, pick scripts that are diverse, don't try to turn GoT or LotR into something it is not.  There are no black Dwarves in LotR, it would have been interesting if there were, any people that live predominantly underground are more likely to become albino.  People understand why your skin is white and why other people skin is darker, it is due to many generations under the sun or lack thereof.  I hate to break it to the white people who go to sunnier climates or black people who go to where everyone turned white, your descendants are going to morph into whatever the environment dictates is most advantageous.  It isn't a status symbol.

If Hollywood or Bezos are too afraid to portray literature as it was intended then leave it alone and make something original that was inspired by it instead."
State of Happiness,"Don’t think the fans are bothered by a black actor playing a rich person, they’re bothered by the fact that the character’s supposed to be a pasty white inbred royal. Valerians are not benevolent figures, they’re supposed to be racists that are obsessed with blood purity."
State of Happiness,Correct me if my wrong but doesn't Rhaeynra marry a Velayron? And her 3 kids are widely believed to be bastards of Harwin Strong? Wouldn't that be pretty fucking easy to prove if her husband was a black guy lol?

Liberty,"People had really high expectations, considering how much money they put into it, and a lot of people felt let down by the quality of the writing. I enjoyed the show overall, but it really felt like they took a lot of Tolkien elements and created a generic fantasy show with great production value."
Liberty,"LOTR was my favorite series of all time. Seen each one 100+ times, that being said there are a lot of reasons why I was really disappointed with RoP.

All the story archs when looked at seperately are just really weak and offer such little suspense/drama. The Hobbits storyline was pretty much useless. Galadriels story was (IMO) boring & unsuspensful until the final 20 minutes. The dwarves were cool, I liked the scenes with Elrond & his dwarf budd, but towards the end I wanted more aside from them just bickering, making up and chilling.


And honestly watching HOTD alongside this really made RoP look terribly boring. Every character in HOTD, like Otto or Viscerys, hooked me to the TV....whether it was the actors or the writing or the drama occuring.


I really cannot say the same for RoP, not a single scene had me like 'HOLY SHIT' while sweating in suspense. No scene came close to the drama of scenes such as the fight between the kids, the ending scenes of the season, the throne room scene, I could go on and on. The peak drama of RoP was the Volcano eruption and the ending which neither really impressed me.


In 10 hours of HOTD & the original LOTR trilogy there were so many amazing moments, memories & characters that I fell in love with watching their every minute of screentime....I truly cannot say the same for RoP. Is it a bad show? No, but I have been simply spoiled by HoTD & the original LOTR trilogy to the point where if you can't beat that, or the drama of GoT season 1-4 which came out 10+ years ago then I'm not really that impressed."
Liberty,"Bad acting, bad story, bad pacing, bad direction, bad cinematography, bad set design, butchered characters, and so on.

Here's a simple example: When the elves are captured and digging the tunnel, they are offered water. This is just a ruse by the orcs to kill their labor force for some reason, but that's beside the point. The orc cuts the throat of the elf who accepts the offered water, and the scene goes to slow-motion as the other elves react to his death. Why? We don't know the character. We're not even that familiar with the other elves. And this murder isn't relevant to the story, it doesn't change the trajectory of the plot in any way, it doesn't affect any of the characters.

But the showrunners or whoever was responsible for this decision had read somewhere that slow-motion makes an event more impactful and dramatic, and said to themselves ""Well, I think this moment should be more impactful and dramatic, so I'll use slow-motion here"". Because they have no idea what they're doing. You don't just throw around slow-motion for any scene that you think is dramatic because then you just set the bar too low and any other scene with slow-motion now loses its impact. And they keep making this mistake over and over again.

When the black elf escapes the orcs, they once again use slow-motion as he runs into the forest. Again, they just press the ""impactful and dramatic"" button because that is the extent of their understanding of their craft. This is once more a pretty non-consequential scene where little of importance happens. Yes, he escapes, but that is pretty obvious from the start. The outcome of the entire scene is obvious, so all you're doing with slow-motion is forcing emotions that don't exist into the scene. And, once agsin, you've lowered the bar for what is worthy of slow motion, making it harder for you to communicate actually dramatic and impactful scenes.

It's just a very bad show, made by people who have no clue what they're doing, and no understanding of the source material they're adapting. Yes, you may like it, but some people also like eating literal shit."
Liberty,"The dialogue is terrible and the plot is a series of wacky coincidences. I think the actors all did an incredible job, but there's only so much you can do with lines like:

""we will sweep the enemy from these lands like salt from a table."" 

If that were a one-off, fine. But that's like, half the dialog in the show. I can't enjoy a show with bad writing."
Liberty,">isn’t that what adaptations are for?

If they're thoughtful and competent, yeah.

It's visually very pretty, but there are huge problems with the plot, characters, and dialogue.

So much of the dialogue sounds like it was written by a 12-year-old who thought it would sound cool in a trailer. This is part of a greater flaw the showrunners actually bragged about, which is the desire to make everything feel ""epic,"" which in their minds meant over-the-top melodrama, way too much awkward use of slow motion, and lots of drawn-out scenes that are supposed to be really emotional but aren't, because they haven't done the work to make anyone give a fuck about the characters involved. I could have cooked a turkey in the amount of time it took female Sam to say goodbye to female Frodo.

Their portrayal of Galadriel was a mess, a complete departure from Tolkein's writings and the movies. She's supposed to be this kind of mystical, super-wise, extremely insightful person, and they degraded her into a generic Marvel ninja warrior. In the scene with the ice troll, she just dances around beating the shit out of it like it's nothing, even though it tossed the rest of her supposedly elite squadron of elf Sauron-hunters around like hapless ragdolls. They all had to be completely incompetent to make her look cool. Ditto the training scene in Numenor, where she fights like 15 guys at once, and they all basically just hold their swords in exactly the right position for her to hit them all, clearly trying to lose as if they're pretending to fight a 6-year-old with cancer and get their asses kicked to put a smile on his face. Despite making her a comically over-the-top badass  on the battlefield, the writers made her act like a petulant teenager when it comes to politics, basically showing up in Numenor and recklessly insulting the people whose help she's requesting. She only mysteriously gets her way because the plot needs it to happen. The real Galadriel is 3500 years old and one of the wisest beings in Middle Earth; she would have approached that situation with great delicacy and expertise. It isn't a valuable ""adaptation"" to make a character a dumb, shallow shell of themselves.

Also, the greatest smith who ever lived is just now learning about alloys? The fuck?

That's really just the tip of the iceberg of ways they screwed this up. If you actually want to know why people are down on the show, watch the entertaining Youtube videos by Pitch Meeting and Critical Drinker. With so many cast and crew putting so much effort and love into this show, it's a damn shame that the nitwits running the studio didn't think to bring on some competent writers and showrunners to make it all meaningful. I really wanted to like this show and not be hit over the head with something that makes me roll my eyes several times per episode."
Liberty,"Ignoring the lore deviations and viewing it as its own thing, which you have to do because the lore deviations are hilarious, it's still kinda underwhelming.

Galadriel's attitude changes 180 degrees in one episode for no reason and then back to normal after that, like the writers weren't talking to eachother.

The harfoots story goes absolutely nowhere. They threaten to kick out anyone who can't keep up rather than help (they have people unencumbered walking alongside their family wagons while not helping those who are having trouble with wagons, which is just.. evil.. like wtf).

Lenny Henry's wife every time she's featured wants to expel someone like the stranger or Nori and her Da, and finally she's ok with them and Lenny Henry says without an ounce of irony that she's always right. Like.. again.. this is first draft nonsense that needed a second set of eyes. If she wasn't right  the 100x she wanted to expel those people, why was she always right when she says they should stay?

Sauron's motivations are all over the map. He's not prescient. He didn't show up on that raft so Galadriel could take him to Numenor.  Why was he on the raft? No idea. Why did he carve directions to his secret lair on bodies? Don't know, don't care. So he goes with Galadriel to Numenor, and wants to get in the smithing guild, and it's not a big city by any means so he tries to steal someone's badge like they'd never catch him considering he was smithing award winning pieces (someone notices generally when you're really really good at your job). Galadriel is hell bent on making him king of the southlands for ... reasons... and yet he's like no i don't want it, then ten seconds later he wants it.

Someone constructs a device to create Mordor complete with a special key to do it, and doesn't activate it. Why? No idea. Why did it need that key? if you were just wanting to create Mordor why not just do it?

The show is run by people who were acolytes of JJ Abrams and his mystery box-style and so the whole show is a bunch of mystery boxes where opening said boxes reveals they had no idea what they wanted to do.

The show makes me slightly angry because it's yet another attempt at high fantasy entertainment where the showrunners seemed to have disdain for what they're doing. These showrunners had a smattering of credits for garbage mostly from before so they were not brilliant people, but in the Rings of Power podcast said the idea of Annatar was stupid. Good job guys, shitting on Tolkien."
Liberty,"The writing was just bad. Strong female character abandons ship in the middle of the ocean and her plan is to swim home? 

They spent the better part of a whole episode to get the dwarfs to build some mystical tower for some reason and never mention it again.

They abandon a castle on a mountain with one path leading up to it for a fucking village in a valley to make their last stand.

It's about everything I remember from the show."
Liberty,I find it hard to enjoy simply because I’m not a cross ocean swimmer.
Liberty,"For me it started to become a realization the further I got away from viewing it. I thought it was okay at first, like you. But the more I d thought on it, it’s just silly in a lot of spots."
Liberty,"The writing is objectively bad (yes, [objectively](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/objectively)). You can still like it. I like a lot of bad B movies and crappy old monster movies. But the RoP screenwriting is indefensible.  
  
Without writing a novel, lets just use three points:  
  
Teleportation. Characters appear where they are scripted to be, often hundreds of leagues away. There is no sense of time or scale when elves just walk and appear at the doors of Khazad-Dum.  
  
McGuffin Sword. They waged battles for a sword hilt to ""create their home"" but all it did was move a stone. Orcs are strong in general, and they have access to trolls. They don't need the sword to create a volcano. They have ways to build castles and dig multi-mile trenches. They can break a dam.

Side note on McGuffin Sword: At one point, Arondir has the sword (to his knowledge) and sees his girlfriend's son. The kid then says he misses the sword because ""it made him feel powerful"". So Arondir hands ***the cursed sword of Sauron*** over to the kid. There are a lot of people that didn't check the item beforehand, which is its own writing failure, but as far as Arondir *knew*, he was holding a corrupting blade of the most vile enemy. And then handed it over to a child because... ""it made him feel powerful"".  
  
Halbrand tells Celebrimbor how to mix metals. Celebrimbor is the second best smith of all time (only his grandfather was better, iirc). He knows more about metalsmithing than any other mind on Middle Earth. And a random human is going to walk up, tell him BASIC smithing information, is like me teaching Gordan Ramsey how to boil water.  
  
There are dozens more poor plot points, inconstant dialogue, or unfocused character choices (Nori grabs Gandalf, hurts HERSELF, and blames him?), but its not worth writing them all out. People have made up their minds.  
  
You're allowed to like badly written shows. But don't act like they aren't badly written. I can like a badly acted show, but I wouldn't then claim its well acted. Enjoyment can be found in the bad.

And while I'm not a big fan of his books (I am a big fan of his lectures), [Brandon Sanderson has a hilarious reaction when discussing Rings of Power.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q83nbq8TXjY&ab_channel=ConfusedHamburger)"
Liberty,"Normally I'm in the boat of people who don't care how they mess with the source material as long as the show is good. 2022 changed my mind entirely. Shows like the Witcher, Rings of Power and anything else that already has great source material....STOP rewriting it! Just stop. You clearly can't do a good job, so just stop trying. Honestly, I would rather they just took a shot for shot or page by page, chapter by chapter w.e of beloved franchises and just put them on the screen. I'm so tired of these writers thinking they can do a better job than the people who created it. Wheel of Time is another one. Completely garbage show, amazing IP. Before anyone even asks, no I wouldn't care if it's exactly what was in the book, game, w.e original source with no deviation what so ever. That would make them all 1000x better. I'm not saying all writing sucks nowadays, cause there are clearly some insanely well written shows and movies. Just adaptations are horrible right now. Idk who these writers think they are."
Liberty,">  What is up with the hate boner Reddit has for this show?

Because the show was fucking terrible.

>   There was clearly a great deal of work and care put into it

I don't care, how much work was put into anything. If it isn't any good I will treat it as such.

>   and while I understand it may take a few liberties with the source material, isn’t that what adaptations are for?

This really doesn't matter to me. RoP took a hell of a lot more than a few liberties."
Liberty,"I get what you mean, and I also expected grandeur and spectacle, but for me, it just wasn't there. Like, there were some scenic shots that hinted at grandeur, but it never came to fruition. Everything felt so small. Especially compared to the epic, awe inspiring scale of the LOTR movies - which this show will rightly and inevitably be compared to.

Really, it felt like I was watching Star Trek Voyager sometimes: small sets, small 10 man skirmishes passed of as big battles. It felt like the whole of middle earth had about the population of a small town High School."
Liberty,Asks people for their opinions then summarily dismisses said opinions. /eyeroll
Liberty,"I can appreciate the work that went into it in some aspects but overall there was a severe issue with quality for me. The production elements were wildly inconsistent, a lot of money was spent on CGI but clearly very little spent on a lot of practical elements (see the horrendous armor for an example). The fight coreography looked both absurdly rehearsed and terrible. The dialogue was really difficult to listen to, whether lines were nonsensical, inconsistant, or contradictory to established information. The writing overall was really poor, from the overbearing contrivances, to the complete lack of consideration of how anyone would react in the different scenarios, the story and characters had so little thought put into anything that happened.

I can appreciate that people liked it, fair enough, but for my money it is one of the most incoherent, and incompetent productions i have seen, especially considering the resources at hand."
Liberty,"As someone who actually was familiar with the sources, this was a simple butchery of the material. Every opportunity squandered, every character rendered poorly. Weird character decisions and a focus on making the story ""mystery"" and ""theory crafting!?!?!?"" Based rather than coherent and good. 

Oh gee guys I wonder what the deal is with Celeborn in the show! Crazy shit am I right, better get on Twitter and theory craft with the pals over it.

It's just not good, and considering the already somewhat limited cast of characters in the material they didn't portray like, any of them well. Gil Galad comes off as a massive cunt, Elrond is everybody's bitch ass whipping boy, Elendil is some dirty ship captain for some reason etc. And Numenor looks pretty but is pretty poorly thought out and designed all things considered and it's worldbuilding is totally all over the place."
Liberty,"I think it's fascinating & sad how pop culture is caught in such a strange catch-22. The only thing entertainment companies are willing to bank on are beloved properties because that's what people want, but people are much more sure as to what they *don't* want than what they actually do. They don't want storytellers to create completely new stories in the properties per say. They just want supplemental additions to what's already there, but not *too* much, but not nothing either. They don't want just a rehash. It can't be too strange, it needs to immediately remind them of the things they like. But without trying *too* hard to remind them of the things they like, no cheap cameos (unless the cameos are really cool, then they're fine).

I didn't think Rings of Power was particularly adventurous. It was pretty safe overall. So it's just bizarre to me to see people lashing out at characters doing things they're known for. But I've come to conclusion that it's entirely because of the huge footprint of the Jackson movies. People can't disassociate it from that, maybe it came out a little too early."
Liberty,"It's written horribly 

There's alot money into but dam they need better writers"
Liberty,I tried watching it. Fell asleep during both of the first 2 episodes. I was super excited before it came out. Maybe it got better. I'll probably try watching it again when I have nothing else to watch.
Liberty,"why would I want to change your mind?  don't let anyone tell you you shouldn't like something, especially on Reddit. Enjoy what you enjoy, no stress

I personally hated it for a plethora of reasons I've said too many times, but would never tell you to avoid it because I think it's a garbage ass show that spits on Tolkien's work"
Liberty,Im still not convinced this wasnt some elaborate money laundering scheme
Liberty,"It unfortunately but rightfully has to be compared to LOTR as it aspires to be.  I think the interesting thing about LOTR is that while each film Is 3+ hours the original cuts are so well edited that u feel like so much happens.  Rings of Power I found just relentlessly slow and fragmented among waaaay too many plot lines(I genuinely did not give a flying fuck about the hobbits, they felt obligatory).  In addition much of the plot felt too fan servicey (mithril, mithril mithril, balrog, balrog balrog)"
Liberty,Just as a show it’s fine and enjoyable.  As a continuation of Tolkien’s work it’s disappointing.  The mighty fleet of Numinor beings as three row boats?  Sauron seducing the elves to make rings of power over what felt like a century in the literature seems more like a quick adventure in a buddy movie.  That part is tough to understand if you love the books.  The dwarves and early hobbits are nicely done though.
Liberty,"It's the most generic fantasy show you can ever have.

Tolkien rating is a 1/10. Barely has anything to do with lord of the rings.

Show rating is a 5/10. Generic. Feels like narnia. Slow, boring, bad writing, useless and unexplained scenes, character inconsistencies (badass miss forever-grimface-with-no-emotions galadriel smiling for no reason as she rides a horse. Why was that shot even needed? Lol)

For something that had this massive budget put into it, it came out simply mediocre. It's watchable, I enjoyed it, but it's far from good, let alone the best. I watched youtube movies made from gameplay with a better plot and writing than this

Edit: Should have made it more clear. I didn't mean to diss Narnia. I should have said the show feels more like Narnia than Lord of the Rings in terms of looks and music etc."
Liberty,"To each his own. I thought it had lazy writing, poor direction, appaling acting, boring dialogue, a weak overall premise, and flat characters. To me that's not enjoyable."
Liberty,"I agree, it was fine. Its 6.9 rating is maybe even a little generous, nothing to write home about. 

I think the dialogue was poorly written for the most part, speaking in riddles and anecdotes all of the time while clearly being aimed towards a young audience.

As an Irishman, its the first and only thing I've ever seen where I felt it was genuinely racist, I felt offended. The hobbits having Irish accents - understandable. Not a single one of those actors being Irish? Ridiculous. The only good Irish accent was from Lenny Henry, an Englishman. The dialogue for the hobbits is infuriating ""and our fields o' grain"" and other ridiculous things. All while the costume people just put straw in their hair and dirty all over their faces. Maybe I'm being sensitive, but it's the only thing I've ever been offended by based on nationality. 

Quite frankly, the budget for this show was insanely high. And the aggressive amount of oversaturated CGI is just plain lazy. The hobbit has aged like milk due to its CGI. This will age even worse imo. Another classic cashgrab that very few will ever rewatch, from a franchise with an incredible loyal fanbase.

I've also heard that Amazon had curbed the negative reviews on imdb at release. I don't know how true that is tbh, but they do own the platform and I believe reviews were blocked at one point.

The show has similar Amazon related problems to what the wheel of time had. Not actually very loyal to the source material, poorly written dialogue and an overall lack of good early character development."
Liberty,"You can put a lot of work into something and still have it suck. 

Just look at the Yugo I bought in high school and kept on the road for a summer.

Effort is only rewarded when the end result is good, otherwise it’s just embarrassing."
Liberty,"It was just boring. Flat characters and motivations that weren't quite explained enough. Uhhh I gotta kill Sauron who might not even be alive anymore and when I find him disguised amongst my friends, I never tell anybody and tell them to go ahead with his plan. Uhhh I believe the stranger is good for no discernable reason. The southland is apparently one single village. Idk. So many weird writing decisions, but overall I was simply bored. Nothing more nothing less. It's not the worst thing I ever watched, but I do not await the second season with hurra."
Liberty,"It's very disjointed and not very well written. For what it costs it's looks great and the scenes with the dwarves are very entertaining, but it isn't enough."
Liberty,"At the price point it was set in anything but absolutely amazing is unforgivable

Strip it of its LOTR ties and what do you get? Generic, tropey, unrewarding fantasy where the main character has too much plot armor and random luck pushing her forward"
Liberty,"I really wanted to like it more than I ended up liking it. I've been a Tolkien fan since I was a kid in the 80s. I reread the LOTR trilogy several times and now every time I take a long trip I listen to the BBC radio production of it (Sir Ian Holm plays Frodo which makes his casting as Bilbo a nice touch). I've read the Silmarillion twice and listened to the audiobook while driving a couple of times before I lost the CDs. 

I'm not Stephen Colbert but I have a good grasp on a lot of Middle Earth stuff.

All this is to say - I didn't actually mind some of the changes. I did, however, mind the dialogue. Some of it was really, really awful. ""The Sea is Always Right!"" sounds like someone in the writer's room only meant it as a placeholder for an actual motto.

The biggest issue I had, by far, was Galadriel. They put so much fucking work into shoehorning her into things when they really had no need to. Invent a new Elvish captain played by the same actress with the same arc and I'm down.

Galadriel is so starkly different from the character in the books that it boggles my mind that they took this step. She has this ethereal, demigod feeling both in the movies and the books. The argument is that Rings of Power is like ~3k years before LOTR but as near as I can tell Galadriel is like 25k years old in Rings of Power. So essentially we're supposed to accept that this tremendous change in her happens between the equivalent of 25 and 28 years old?

Characters like Galadriel are better in the background. Aloof and mysterious. I'm sure they're gonna go down some sort of 'her ring makes her that way' route but I just don't see why they made that choice and it annoys me to no end.

It's a blank slate. You are already going to have a good reason to use Eldrond, Celeborn, and 1 or more of the Wizards that's more than enough.

I also really don't like the reported Walter White route they're taking with Sauron. Still, I could have accepted that but I not sure I'll ever understand why they went with Galadriel instead of a fresh 'new' character."
Liberty,"I would recommend searching YouTube for critiques. I've seen some great line-by-line breakdowns of how novice the writing and pacing were, and how things could be done differently.

[Example](https://youtu.be/2Fk9zNQF2Vs)"
Liberty,"NGL I don’t get the hate, other than Morfydd Clark’s acting. 

It’s horrendous. 


I could’ve put a blonde wig on my dick, made it so the jumping thing, and puppeteer a few lines and made it more compelling."
Liberty,I honestly was amazed to find myself not caring about watching the next episode when everything looked so good. After an episode of GOT or HOTD or BCS there were so many things in every episode I wanted to talk to people about. But after an episode of ROP it was just “that orc looked really cool”
Liberty,"That edit though, are you serious? The most upvoted replies to your question are well reasoned criticisms of the show and your response to all this is to cherry pick the trolliest of responses and conclude that it's just ""reddit being biased""?"
Liberty,"Quick answer: The show is being branded as if it was Tolkien's work. It isn't, and the show would have benefited from not having the weight of the books or Jackson's movies leaning on it. So you have a core audience that gets annoyed immediately and then they take some favorite characters and just outright re-skin them, the Galadriel of the show bears no resemblance to the one in the books, and a bunch of names that were just thrown in like Elrond and Elendiel. Add in that the dialog was generally atrocious and that so much of the show doesn't pay off meaningfully in season and yeah, people are going to be annoyed."
Liberty,All the location teleporting stripped me of immersion in the story.
Liberty,It’s a bland corporate product produced by bland corporate yes-men.
Liberty,"I had very low expectations going in, and I was still immeasurably disappointed. Almost everything about it is bad. The only salvageable part is Elrond and Durin's relationship, and Elendil. (I personally didn't think Adur was that great unlike a lot of people).

I know it's a copout to say there are too many things to pick from, but there are genuinely too many things to pick from as examples of why it's so atrocious, so I'll stick with the basics:

The writing is terrible. The story is bad, the dialogue is bad, the plot structure is bad.  
The directing is terrible, though mainly the episodes done by Wayne Che Yip (3, 4, 5, 8).  
Creative liberties are completely understandable for an adaptation. Peter Jackson made creative liberties. The liberties made in Rings of Power are *almost* as bad as The Last Jedi is to the original Star Wars trilogy. It's glorified fan fiction. There is much more screen time of characters that don't exist in the books than there are characters that exist in the books. And they're not well written characters. And the characters that *do* exist in the books are doing things that never happened in the books.

There are countless more reasons even on just a scene to scene basis. But it's ultimately just dogshit fanfiction that is the problem."
Liberty,"Rings of Power doesn't take a few liberties; it butchers the existing lore.

The most obvious sin is that Galadriel has become a warrior and her husband has been written out.

Another big example is Celebrimbor, the second best elf craftsman in history. He is a complete idiot who struggles with elementary smithing but is, somehow, still skilled enough to make some of most powerful, second only to the silmarils, artefacts middle earth has ever seen."
Liberty,Boring is boring 🤷‍♂️
Liberty,"I liked it as a show once I separated it from the  books. It took more than a few liberties from the source material. So much of the story is out of order  from the source material. It's hard to tell a story that spans thousands of years so I get they had to condense it, but things are happening out of order for no reason."
Liberty,It was…. meh 😴
Liberty,"Coming from reading most of the later books and the proper JRR books I was really amped for such a huge budget show about the world and stories I have read. It became unrecognizable outside of character names and locations. 

I can’t deny that it was pretty, but that’s about as far as I can go with complements. If I want to see something without feeling but really great FX I would watch avatar. It’s just simply not for me, which sucks because I really love Tolkien fantasy but this just isn’t that for me. 

I would like to add that the “diversity issue” people keep bringing up…get over it. It’s fantasy and the books don’t state any rules on this, so cool it and read the books. If you can’t deal with a black hobbit I wonder how you deal with real world issues."
Liberty,"It was just so, unenjoyable for me. I'm not a love it or hate it kinda dude, I'm fine with things being okay but I just didn't like it. 

From the head scratching moments like how Sauron and Galadriel randomly meet in the middle of the ocean to how the queen doesn't want people to know she's blind and the next scene she's wearing a blindfold. A leaf somehow woke up a Balrog? Does it have allergies or something? The whole elf/mithril shenanigans, it's just too much buffoonery that takes me out of it."
Liberty,"Even if we disregard LotR canon the writing just doesn't makes any sense and is lazy. Think the writer thought of the twists first before writing the story and lazily connect the dots. And they try to be smart by referencing to the LotR movie and books but do not care the canon.
And still baffles me that Amazon put the show on 2 inexperienced showrunners."
Liberty,"Grandeur and spectacle was great, and I couldnt care less about the source material.  But MAN the dialogue and characters just suuuuuucked….

The only characters I didnt want to drown were dwarves.  The stupid/cheesy/dumb/sterile lines outnumbered good lines like 20 to 1.

I was so so bored throughout anything that wasnt an elaborate action sequence.  I actually skipped forward in parts."
Liberty,"It's a 2 and a half hour movie spread out over an entire season of TV. So many shows are like that now. 6-8 hours of show, but maybe 2 that keeps you engaged."
Liberty,"Work? Certainly. Care? Not so much, by their own admission.

What Grandeur and spectacle? Wide shots mean nothing if its a facade. This doesnt mention the writing, which aside from seemingly hating the source material is just bad.

And the bar wasnt particularly high after the Hobbit Trilogy."
Liberty,"I loved morfydd clark in Saint Maud, and genuinely went into it trying to like it. But my interest dried up after 4 episodes, it just felt uninteresting and boring. I think it needed good direction and editing"
Liberty,"The dialogue is terrible. It wants to be lofty and ""olden"" and comes across as highschool theater.

None of their storylines on their own are very interesting. The pacing drags, especially Galadriel's detour through Numenor. Her character is the worst. She's supposed to be smarter than the choices she takes and keeps blaming others for the consequences.

This kind of mystery box writing doesn't serve Tolkien. I didn't get any suspense from guessing around Halbrand's identity or meteor man's. It was obvious who they were from the beginning, yet to this day makes zero sense.

The action is lame. See anything in LotR for reference. It tries to be showy but none of it feels urgent or carries any weight. 

I could go on.

Oh, Mordor just being created in like a minute at the turn of a key was so dumb."
Liberty,Have you watched the LotR trilogy film? you can try to compare the quality of the writing between them and you'll know how much worse Rings of power is.
Liberty,"I haven't seen it yet but the show cost 1 billion dollars, the writing was shit, the casting was weird, and there was no real ""source material"" used basically. but I haven't given it a watch because anyone who seems to enjoy good television who I've spoken to said it wasn't worth watching"
Liberty,I'm going to go back to it eventually but I found the first episode to be incredibly boring so I stopped
Liberty,"Wait.  We're supposed to judge television content based on ""work and care put into it. """
Liberty,"For me it just wasn’t really about anything.

And as a big fan of the movies, I found it distracting that it wasn’t exactly part of that world. Either have it be set in that exact world or don’t. This was very in-between.

It’s a well made show, but if they plan to keep it going and gain a following it needs to break through whatever barriers are holding it in with its story and characters. Perhaps embrace being it’s own thing."
Liberty,'There was clearly a great deal of work and care gone into it' ...bahahahahahahaha
Liberty,I still cannot believe they chose to write original story with some appendices from Lord of the Rings book. It's basically a fan fiction.
Liberty,"This show had three fakeout deaths for a minor character (ie, not in the source material). That’s how bad the writing is."
Liberty,Because it's bad
Liberty,I just found it boring tbh
Liberty,That edit is some self absorbed shit
Liberty,"Visuals are spectacular, LOTR music is phenomenal but nothing in RoP had that epic grip on me. Costumes are forgettable, in fact some felt more “romanesque” especially on the the elves. Add the short hairstyles and youd think you were watching a tamer version of HBO’s Rome. Characters are either bland and forgettable or they are downright annoying (Harfoots). I think only the Dwarfs and Elrond are decent in this show in term of the writing quality and that subject deserves a post of its own because its such a letdown and so cheap for such an expensive show."
Liberty,">What is up with the hate boner Reddit has for this show?

Imagine writing this and then judging people for not having a real weigh in to your opinion."
Liberty,"I’m absolutely one of the critics, but I’ll admit I actually overall enjoyed it too. I’m not a Tolkien expert, I just had too many problems with the writing and acting, but I agree with what you said: despite this, it was obviously an extremely well-crafted and visually stunning show that had more than enough good parts to simply lean back and enjoy. 

A lot of people forget that you can still enjoy something despite criticizing it."
Liberty,"Why do you want someone to make you hate what you enjoyed?

I personally thought the show was awful....""I'm good"" line being informative. 

Characters frequently contradict themselves within the same episode. The Queen of Numenor talks about not wanting anyone to know she is blind, but the next scene she is wearing a blindfold. You see the Numenorians on their ships, then on shore with a ton of horses. Where did they come from, and how did they know exactly where to go? 

The show is rife with these types of inconsistencies and formulaic writing, entirely predictable ""twists"". They are after a Mcguffin which is switched, which pours water on a volcano....activating it....???? 

The special effects were sometimes good, sometimes....there's a warg. 

Its easy to pick apart how bad this show was. I guess its possible to enjoy it if you don't think about or don't care about the consistency/coherence of the plot."
Liberty,Because it felt like Tolkien fan-fic.
Liberty,Certain things just end up with a crosshair on them from the getgo for an online hatemob. Rings of Power was a perfectly decent fantasy show that unfortunately got targeted by people frothing at the mouth in a desperate need to rage about something.
Liberty,"The show is quite bad from a writing standpoint. Character development and arcs are also genuinely bad. 

Granted all things are relative. If you like fantasy, even generic fantasy can be interesting. It can be a fun place for you to imagine how you would do things differently. 

But this was particularly bad for several reasons. First, the plot is mostly just contrived, lazy, and lacks consequences. Characters are not given enough to do, or grow, with an exception being the elrond and during plot line. Although even that was half baked as well. 

Take galadriel for example, they want to say instead of a sorcerer/head of state that she is the commander of the north, scourge of the orcs. We never really see her lead elves into battle. And only really she her fight a few orcs in the entire series.

They tell you she is a badass, they don't show it in any meaningful way. Even the scene with the snow troll is disappointing. It's over before it really begins. She just flips through the air and kills it in one second. There was no tension, no sense of danger, and honestly kind of boring. 

That is the running theme of show. The dwarven storyline with durin and elrond gave them some conflict where the actors could actually act, without going overboard or melodramatic. It actually felt the most real. But the plot of it felt like it ended in the middle of story. 

Galadriel comes across as irritated, grumpy, and melodramatic. The worst part is, they made these changes but didn't really put any character development with it. 

She acts like an asshole, then is just given a spy report with exactly the information she has spent hundreds of years looking for. Gets an army when tree leaves start falling. She was not given an opportunity to grow and try different ways to be diplomatic or earn the things she is working toward. 

The southlands could have been more interesting. But one of my biggest issues, and this goes for the show in general, is that the scale is so small. 

Battles involve hundreds, not thousands, and you honestly never get any wide shots of hundreds of people either. It's just some close ups of ten to twenty people fighting. 

People generally just fast travel. Characters like celebrimbor, a master smith, doesn't know about alloys and comes across as stupid. 

This is a trend I see in a lot of modern television. They make one character look strong/smart by making everyone one around look super incompetent. Think book of boba Fett for a prime example of that. 

Ultimately, this is a show that widely changed from source material to give us average at best generic story. Nothing they changed was because it made it more compelling TV. It was either because they didn't secure the rights or were lazy."
Liberty,"For all the hype and expenditure, there simply wasn’t very much on this show to hold one’s interest. The writing was poor, the dialogue was cringe, the costumes and sets were underwhelming, the characters were lame and the acting was mediocre. It takes real, professional grade incompetence to accomplish so little with so much."
Liberty,"I don’t care about the woke changes, really doesn’t matter to me. The show is just boring. It drags on and on. Characters all have thinly veiled motivations. 

Who is this? What race is that? It’s not a hobbit for some reason. Could not care less. There’s like a million characters. Can’t remember any of their names. The whole show seemed pointless. 

Elrond was hanging with his Dwarf friend who is a prince and they argue about this or that. Really overacted, and seriously - this is just poor pacing. I can’t believe how many episodes Elrond is just like “please bro, help me out.” And the dwarf shouts about this or that. Like one scene on this whole plot line would be enough. 

It is badly written and directed. 

The wheel of time on prime was way better. And that’s saying something."
Liberty,"> it may take a few liberties with the source material, isn’t that what adaptations are for?

Nope."
Liberty,"It didn’t “take a few liberties”.  It completely rewrote characters and events.  Jackson essentially combining Arwen and Glorfindel to improve pacing in the “The Fellowship of the Ring” was taking a few liberties.  Making Galadriel an armed warrior and the commander of the Northern Armies, never mentioning her husband or implying she spent 1000 years thinking he was dead or gone (not to mention her daughter, Elrond’s wife), turning Harfoots from one of three tribes or clans of Hobbits into “proto-Hobbits”, etc. is just taking the veneer of Tolkien’s Middle-earth and creating their own story.

The dialog (“there is a tempest in me”) and storylines (jumping off a raft in the middle of the ocean to SWIM between continents and then conveniently having a ship come along that exact route?) were just shyte — I’ve seen better fan fiction.  They could certainly have written their own story this way but don’t besmirch Tolkien’s works by claiming their show is an extension of it (or worse, as they implied, better)."
Liberty,"The last couple episodes are pretty good but the writing quality was mostly pretty low.

It’s like they had a competent professional come up with the main beats then fired them and installed a team of grad school kids to write the scenes."
Liberty,The dialogue is so bad you could watch it dubbed in a language you don't understand and everything (except for Elrond and Durin plus one scene for Adar) would make more sense.
Liberty,A few episodes in I just switched my brain off and just looked at the pretty pictures. Thats all the show managed to do. That jail scene still bothers me tho
Liberty,"I *LOVED* rhe LOTR series and watch them far more often than my wife would like. I was looking forward to ROP. Unfortunately I watched it along with the GOT series.

It’s not that Ring was terrible, it’s not. It’s more like Nickelback. It doesn’t generate much feeling from us, at all. It’s beautiful, but boring."
Liberty,"It’s because RoP feels more like a fantasy drama than a fantasy epic. Remember in LotR when you felt the sense of wonder and trepidation of an epic journey across vast lands? Sadly RoP suffers from the trope of teleporting characters now, so people simply show up in a scene, say whatever they need to, then appear thousands of miles away a few minutes later."
Liberty,"Just because there was a lot of work put into it doesnt mean it cant be bad. Yeah the visuals were crazy but the world felt empty and the story didnt move me at all.

And dont even let me talk about the characters. There is no one to pull for.

When you compare it to house of dragon you start to see how bad it was and ROP had a huge budget."
Liberty,"The only redeeming qualities are visual and audio design (which you'd expect would be good for a billion dollar show). **Even if you completely put aside the source material and judge it 100% in a vacuum**, the writing is bad, the fight scenes are laughable (especially some Galadriel ones), the acting is uneven, the characters (except like 2/3 of them, like Elrond/Durin) are bland, the dialogue is lazy, the pacing is fucked (slow start and very rushed end)."
Liberty,"I wanted to like it. Mostly because of the incels that hated it. But it's just not good. Not for the reasons they think, obviously. Disa is one of the best characters. 

But the costumes look they came right out of the box, the supporting cast is terrible and you just don't care about what happens to the characters.  

The soundtrack tries to be epic but ends up being just annoying. The writing is all over the place. 

At some scenes (like the one where Arondir runs from the orcs and every single one with that boy Theo) i couldn't help but laugh."
Liberty,It’s not complicated. It’s a boring show filled characters I don’t care about. I liked Andor and a bunch of other shows this year but this one just didn’t hit.
Liberty,It was just a boring show. Uninteresting main characters with motivations you don’t give a shit about. Plenty of lazy filler episodes to pad out an uneventful first season. It’s ok for people to not like something that you liked. The show was hated by many by being boring with shitty writing trying to make every single statement some grandiose profound deep moment. It was just bad. Not enjoyable. You’re all over the thread trying to convince people it didn’t suck lmao
Liberty,"Time tells the quality of a show, and several months later I barely even remember RoP. I haven't thought about it once since I finished it"
Liberty,"I was really just bored. The show is gorgeous, and everything from the cinematography to the setting is seriously stunning, but I couldn’t get through a single episode without nodding off. Moreover, it built up slow, too. It’s a story with so much provenance that winding up that long feels unacceptable."
Liberty,"Money over story.   Story by committee.  You can feel 10 producers making sure every single scene and line of dialogue is perfect for the most amount of people. This makes very pretty visuals and horrible script.

Like if you can watch a scene and feel a producer say... You know what let's give this grungey tavern scene more diversity.   and let's make sure all our female characters have zero character flaws.  I really like a good story and I think we are being fed dogshot because of the social movements. 

You can write strong female characters without making it feels like it's pandering to middle school girls. OR this show is for middle school girls and they shouldn't call it Lord of the rings."
Liberty,I only watched the first 2 episodes but I found it too dull to continue watching. Maybe it gets better but it certainly doesn't start off very good.
Liberty,The villain was the most interesting character
Liberty,"First off, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you (or anyone) enjoying the show. For many people, it was effective entertainment, and that's great. With that out of the way:

It was an objectively mid-to-poor show in some areas that really hampered its success. It's the Avatar of television: massive budget, visual spectacle, inane writing, and terribly paced. The performances are inconsistent, and many of the liberties they took with the source material were more detrimental than helpful. The Harfoots, an entirely Amazon invention (as a race, not a family name), were one of the biggest offenders. Their story does not intersect with any other, making it feel relatively pointless and slowing down the pacing unnecessarily. It made the momentum slow to a crawl in every scene featuring them.

People also expected it to follow Tolkien's lore more closely. This isn't some obscure work that so few people knew of that it was primed for changes. This is the most popular work of fantasy ever written. Nearly everything Amazon tweaked was weaker than what Tolkien had already written. They had the blueprint laid out for them, and they chose unwisely not to follow it in an effort to accomplish...something. It certainly wasn't to put out the best show possible, as it's record-setting budget didn't equate to a chart-topping run during its season, nor awards nominations after. It's not just Reddit that didn't like it overall - even in Hollywood's eyes, it failed to best its direct competitor, placing behind House of the Dragon in both ratings and accolades. 

So to reiterate, it's okay that you liked it even if many others really don't. Hopefully, this thread will help you understand why there's a 'hate boner' for it. A lot of us just wanted it to be better and know that with Amazon holding the rights, yet bungling the effort, we may not see another second age story on screen in our lifetime. That sucks."
Liberty,"One thing that ""might"" make some difference.......Watching the show one episode at a time felt horribly slow....Watch an episode, not much happens, and you wait a week to see something ""hopefully"" happen. Watching the whole show in a day, or a few days probably doesn't feel so painful. That being  said, 1. I personally just didn't care about any of the characters, and 2. Teasing that a main character is STILL dead going into season 2, when we all know good and well the person  is not  dead, is just lazy writing."
Liberty,"I’ve only seen the movies and hobbit movies(which I enjoyed just not as much as the LOTR trilogy).

I could go on for awhile.

The Mary Sue elf can do no wrong and has an exaggerated way of speaking all the time and doesn’t feel like it has real substance behind it. She doesn’t have any personality because she’s “driven”.

The queen character just seemed ridiculous to me and her facial expressions made no sense most od the time. Not to mention how quickly she flopped back and forth on issues.

The hobbit and old man saga was “ok” and annoying at worst, those hobbit people seem like real assholes leaving the crippled behind.

The elf scout on the frontier town was interesting and most of that series was ok other than the random despair and whining when they began to get attacked by orcs, and I don’t mean the fear of attack, rather the idiocy of joining the orcs and also the “maybe we deserve to die because we are filthy evil humans”. 

The dwarf and elf friendship was probably one of the better parts of the season since everything seemed pretty solid up until mithril is needed to keep elves tree alive and stay on middle earth. Just seems pretty ridiculous even for high fantasy.

The plot threads for all these different stories are pushed forward incredibly fast yet they constantly are having these drawn out scenes for someone being injured or killed when I haven’t had enough time to care about 95% of these characters. 

The queen going blind is another weird concept to employ since again, her motivations flip on a dime and I just generally don’t feel any reality to that whole arc or her character, now I have to watch her go through blindness “heroically” eating up more showtime.

The music is pretty good, if over the top for many scenes that are supposed to reflect significant emotional investment.

Scenery and visuals are fantastic. 

Combat is pretty good.

Special effects are great.

A good story it is not.

Edit: like many others here, season 2 will be make it break it for me."
Liberty,"All my friends saw the trailers and knew it would be bad so they refused to watch it. I didn't care, it's just a trailer. So I watched it with much anticipation. I love the universe so I kept optimistic and watched it hoping to love it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt over the first few episodes. But more and more I couldn't get over how I didn't really care for the characters. I think durin and elrond were the best but that was such a small part of the show. So many decisions they made made no sense to me. Sauron telling Celebrimbor how to make the rings was one that stands out. The biggest issue I had was the writing. ""I am good!"" cringe. I didn't hate the show, but was super disappointed. I will still watch the next season in hopes of a redemption, but I'm not anticipating it."
Liberty,"If I were a huge lord of the rings fan idk how I would feel, but I'm not. So I just watched it without any expectations and really liked it.

On the other hand. It's quite possible it sucks for LOTR fans. I know this because I'm a huge wheel of time fan and they butchered the show in many ways."
Liberty,"They could have saved 250 million right off the top in IP rights, and just made up random names for the characters and it would have been the same show. The writing was quite  poor considering the subject matter."
Liberty,I watched the first 2 episodes and lost interest because it was so boring and slow
Liberty,"I’m not a Tolkien expert and I have no idea about the differences with the source material…but the writing and (because of that) the acting was atrocious. They tried to write high fantasy and got bogged down in emotionless underdeveloped characters. 

Also way too many characters, so that the story loses focus. I never felt that with the movies. And the music is so heavy handed because it’s the only way the viewer knows what emotion to feel. 

Also the extras…soooo bad."
Liberty,Amazon is Isengard.
Liberty,"For me, it was the writing. As a person who only saw the movies and did not read the books, I felt like this was just lazy writing and made it feel like just some fantasy show and not what it was supposed to be, Lord Of The Rings, and I think that is what most of the people hate about it."
Liberty,"All its flaws were magnified by releasing at the same time as HOTD, which was better in basically every way. I don't even care about the source material. RoP was all spectacle, no substance. 

RoP was boring, spent too much time on characters that were not likeable, and CORNY. Not in a ""have hope in the face of tragedy, Frodo,"" kind of way, but the over-the-top, relentless, ""I'm not even remotely worried for this character because they clearly will never kill a child off"" kind of corny."

Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I’ve been to that bunker. It’s kind of unbelievable how stuck in time it is.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,[deleted]
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Yes! She's such an incredible actress, and I've really enjoyed seeing the various roles she has played over the years. Looks like this is going to be another fantastic role for her!"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,She was so great with Capaldi in Doctor Who. Amazing actor!
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Jenna Coleman is attractive.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I wonder if this means that we’re not getting another season of Victoria any time soon.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"She was my least favorite companion, but I’d like to see her in some other stuff

Edit: LOL. Love that people downvote because they don’t agree. I miss the days when users actually understood rediquette and the purpose of the downvote button."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,sexy
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"The most mundane shit gets greenlit nowadays if it fills a diversity tickbox. It's a period romance drama about being an office manager during a war ffs. God forbid they tell the stories of the people actually fighting.

It's just lazy."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I find her very annoying, and she has limited acting range. Very samey in all her roles."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Would have been freaky if you'd come back out and it was suddenly 1942.

Freeeeaky."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,It was deliberately preserved that way. They left it pretty much as it was on 16 August 1945.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I don’t know if she actually speaks French, but she pulled it off for the show"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Haha, my first thoughts after watching the serpent and seeing this headline... I will, uh, keep an eye out for this next show."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,this
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"She left, not by choice.

They're recasting for an older Victoria/Albert/etc for future seasons."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Yeah I think this means there won’t be another series of Victoria.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I had such high hopes for her, but yeah. As a companion it was a flop."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I too really wish someone would *finally* get around to telling the stories of the people who fought in WW2.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Do you think we have a shortage of stories about people fighting in WWII?
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I’m guessing you haven’t seen her in many roles then.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Like in Goodnight Sweetheart, where he walks down an alleyway and finds himself in the 40s, and leads a double life in both the 40s and 90s with two love interests?"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"she doesn’t, and had to learn in weeks! i was shocked, i only googled if she speaks french natively because i saw she was a brit and i was like ????"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Her French accent was decent enough, but it wasn't a Québécois accent. Interestingly enough, when she was on the telephone with her mother, her mother did indeed have a Québécois accent."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I believe shes in talks to do a fourth series but after that she imagines they’ll have to recast with an older actress otherwise she’d be in the makeup chair half of the day having age prosthetics put on
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Where did you see that? The last thing I saw was from earlier this year where she was still in talks for another season, but with the pandemic, plans can change in an instant."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I think she's easily the best companion.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,[deleted]
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I dare say those stories will be more interesting than a group of office workers getting banged by various love interests while we pretend their actions played a more meaningful part in fighting the war than the people on the front - both men and women.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Stories - no. TV series - yes. 

Do you think we lack stories about the work people did on the home front?"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I have. She's utterly bland.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Yeah, actors tend to have dialect coaches to help with both accent and language for roles.

Anya Taylor-Joy, for instance, has had a perfect English accent in a variety of roles and great American accents in Peaky Blinders and whichever film I'm thinking of where she co-starred with Olivia Cooke (another Brit actress).

Surprised to learn Anya's Swedish."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Magazine interview with the show creator not long after the last season aired.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Donna wins that in my book.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I agree, the character was better in the snowmen and the dalek episode. Once Clara became a companion I still liked her but she felt watered down."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,you realize he’s being sarcastic right? there’s plenty of films and TV of WWII soldiers fighting lol
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"The BBC's ""[World on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqe1URnfKv0)"" is literally doing a run on PBS right now.

I think a show about what was going on in the war rooms of the British Government, adapted from a memoir of someone who was really there, isn't a controversial choice to base a show around."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"She is from Argentina and her native language is Spanish, but spent most of her life in England. Where did you get Swedish from?"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I wasn't fond of her, honestly.

Saying that, I never liked her comedy, either."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Same!
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Of course I realised the sarcasm. Happy to hear some ww2 TV series about soldiers fighting - that aren't a documentary or Band of Brothers.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I agree if it would be fine if it was a historical representation of what went on in the War Rooms - the code breaking, the stress, the result of poor intelligence, the battlefor Britain happening overhead. But we both know that it won't be accurate. It will be retold and recast so to reflect the diversity of today's society purely for the purpose of equality. My bet is that there will be POC thrown in for the sake of not offending anyone with the reality of 1940s England, a selfhating gay white man, an unhappy housewife that finds love, and any other myriad of tropes the TV industry thinks the viewer needs education on (World on Fire is a great example of that). 

It will be hacky and overdone. And some people will love it and some will think it's shite."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I ain’t bovvered
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Blackadder?
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,dude just google it lol you will find some
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Well, I'd say that it's too soon to judge what exactly it will be like.  I can almost certainly guarantee that at some point, they will be dealing with the Battle for Britain going on overhead.  British dramas LOVE doing the Battle for Britain.

The truth is that studios have always and will always use tropes in order to tell their story.  Old WW2 movies/TV shows used tropes.  There's the ""All Germans are Nazi's trope.""  There's the ""America were the saviors of WWII"" trope when 80% of the German military were fighting the Soviets.  

Your problem seems to be that you don't like which tropes are in fashion right now, and yes, that includes telling stories that reflect diversity, and telling stories about types of people whose stories weren't told in older treatments of these historical periods.  

You fear that it won't be accurate?  C'mon now.  Most historical dramas aren't completely accurate.  Saving Private Ryan wasn't based on a real story.  It was a complete Hollywood fabrication.  The Dirty Dozen didn't exist.  Even a ""Based on real events"" movie/TV show like ""Patton"" or ""Band of Brothers"" is riddled with historical inaccuracies and uses tropes.   It just seems those are tropes and inaccuracies you don't mind.  If you want complete historical accuracy, watch a documentary.  Movies and TV shows are about storytelling.  Sure, that story can be set in a historical period, or tell a story about how historical figures dealt with real-life events, but the story is primary to the history.  Always has been, always will be.  Even Shakespeare fudged the history here and there when it got in the way of the story he wanted to tell, or even in the way of some social commentary he wanted to make.  So, my question to you is, why are some tropes acceptable and others are not?"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"You are missing the point of what I am saying. I think the industry is so obsessed with recreating history to allow for ""forced diversity"" that they do a disservice to the stories they are trying to tell. 

The only thing that makes this story unique is that it's about women. It could easily be replaced with men and be uninteresting.  That is an indication of a bullshit story."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I think that it's a story about the war rooms of the British Government in WW2.  Those war rooms, in history, included a large number of women.  As far as we know right now, it's not a recreation of history for ""Forced diversity.""  It's a choice to tell a story from history that naturally included diversity.  Whether it turns out to be a good or bad show is anybody's guess, but it should be allowed to stand on its own merits and find it's own audience whether that audience includes you or not.  If you're adverse to stories because they feature women in prominent roles, there's plenty of other shows for you to watch."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,We shall see. But I bet you $50 to a charity of your choice that they alter the ethnic make-up of the women in the War Room so to meet their diversity agenda.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Again, the show is going to use tropes, as all do.  Why is this one so bad compared to all the ones you don't seem have a problem with?"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Because I personally think it speaks to the undermining of the history of what was achieved and by whom. It is part of a broader social project by the media and governments to rehash history to make some segments of society feel more included. Its revisionary and boring.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Women played a role in Britain in WW2, from nurses, to air raid wardens, to mechanics, and yes, they played a prominent role in the Whitehall War Rooms of England.  Why are their contributions so unworthy as to not be deserving of a TV show about them?

The European theater of WWII was mainly a war between Germany and the Soviets.  And yet, practically every American war movie since WWII portrays America as having an outsized role in the victory.

That was done as part of a broader social project by the media and Government to rehash history in order to boost nationalism and also downplay the fact that the war was actually won by the communists who were our adversaries at the time these movies were being made.  

WW2 media has ALWAYS been revisionist.  History drama has ALWAYS been revisionist, for one reason or another.  Shakespeare was writing in Tudor times, so when he was crafting his historical dramas about ""The Wars of the Roses"" he made Richard III a bit more villainous than he was in real life.  This is not a new thing.  You can't say that you don't like revisionist history, because every history drama is revisionist, and pretty much always has been.  You just don't like this particular method of revision.

This story is adapted from a memoir by someone who was there, and you're prematurely attacking it for no other reason than the memoir of the person this story is being adapted is a woman.  If this was a show being announced adapted from the memoir of a man who served in WWII, I bet you'd at least wait until it started filming to start attacking it."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Try the show that this show is obviously spoofing.

Trauma:  Life in the ER."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Headlines are making it a much bigger deal than it actually is. 

TLDR is Jackson wanted to see scripts first before committing, Amazon then got dicey about getting Jackson involved due to his LOTR movies being owned by Warner Bros and wanted to be extra careful about rights complications. PJ has no ill will to Amazon or the show runners and is excited to watch a Tolkien product as someone completely absent from the production.  

A tldr of a tldr; it was just legal bullshit."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Very smart to want to see the script first before committing. You don’t want to have your name attached to something that might stink up the franchise.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I love entertainment news in the 2010’s to today because the internet boom in the 90’s/2000’s led to them figuring out clickbait headlines are what drive clicks and views and now we will get them forever
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,">  The Oscar-winning director of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies reveals the studio asked him to be involved with its upcoming mega-budgeted The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and promised to send him scripts – then never contacted him again.


> “They asked me if I wanted to be involved – [writer-producer Fran Walsh] and I – and I said, ‘That’s an impossible question to answer without seeing a script,'” Jackson recalls to Scott Feinberg on The Hollywood Reporter‘s Awards Chatter podcast. “So they said, ‘As soon as we get the first couple scripts, we’ll send them to you.’ And the scripts never showed up. That’s the last thing I heard, which is fine. No complaints at all.” 

> In an upcoming The Business podcast talking to The Hollywood Reporter‘s Kim Masters, the filmmaker echoes the anecdote and phrases it slightly differently, yet makes the same point: “About four, five years ago they asked if I would be interested in it,” he says. “So I said, ‘Have you got the scripts yet?’ Because I know how hard the scripts were to write for the films and I didn’t know the people writing their scripts. They said, ‘Oh no, we haven’t got the scripts yet, but as soon as we do, we’ll send you the scripts.’ So I was waiting for the scripts to arrive and they never did.” ...

> Amazon responded to Jackson’s comments with the following statement: “In pursuing the rights for our show, we were obligated to keep the series distinct and separate from the films. We have the utmost respect for Peter Jackson and The Lord of The Rings films and are thrilled that he is looking forward to the watching The Rings of Power.”"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Personally, I am sick of getting invested in a show. Watching it for a season or two and then they say “nope it’s too expensive to keep making it.” And they just cancel it. 

The most disappointing one for me is Netflix and Dark Crystal. My daughter and I loved it and watched it together. I’m sure some of it was due to the pandemic but they axed it for costing too much for production. Pisses me off."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"“\[T\]he \[Tolkien\] estate had no involvement with \[Jackson's\] films and Christopher Tolkien has previously slammed the trilogy in the press as 'eviscerating' his father’s books, claiming they turned his novels into action movies for young people that lack 'beauty and seriousness.' ***But the estate is involved with the series...***”

Huh. If the Tolkien family hated Peter Jackson's movies, then their being involved in the series is the least reassuring thing of all time.

I'm excited for this show. I hope it succeeds. But everything I hear about it (save for a couple of the writers hired) has me worried: Spending $465 million on one season of TV; showrunners with no proven track record of success in screenwriting; involvement of the family; some less than impressive cast pics; no sense of the story from watching the trailer.

Ultimately, none of this matters. It could 100% go the other way. But it smacks of treating a production like product you can cash in on. Demanding, not just assuming, that you have a story worth telling is a key part of the process. I'm doubtful of that. On the other hand, of course, all that can be true and if the writers still bring it, the studio's motives will mean sweet fuck all. So, let's hope!"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Well, regardless of whether the specifics of that title are true or not, it's important to remember that **Peter Jackson is the competition.**

Even if they openly claim otherwise.

If I say the word ""Gandalf"", a picture has probably formed in your mind. And that picture probably features Sir Ian McKellen.

If I say ""Sauron"", you probably think of a giant orange eye-thing with fire around the sides. Or maybe some lanky dude in pointy armor.

The larger a fictional property looms in the minds of audiences, the greater the **mental anchor** that exists for their expectations. Whether that's legitimate or not. And therefore the greater the penalty that exists for making changes, and the less wiggle room one has to follow their own vision. Even if you're ostensibly working on the same property. You're fighting the individual memories of the viewer after they've consumed another piece of media.

The prior work is the competition.

Push things too far and you can trigger a legitimacy crisis. Where the newer property doesn't *feel* like the same setting. Even if the changes are truer to the original work. You deviate too hard from the mental anchor, and you shoot yourself in the foot. And turn those *most* familiar with the work, your super-fans, into super-critics. Those with the most energy to identify what they perceive as illegitimate, and broadcast it outwards towards the normies.

So yes. Whether the new TV series likes it or not, they're competing with Peter Jackson."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Possibly unpopular opinion, but kinda glad Peter Jackson isn’t involved. Do t get me wrong love,Love,love the lord of the rings trilogy. One of the best cinematic adventures ever and an amazing adaptation of the book. 
However, the hobbit worried me. Felt too much like it was trying to get the old LOTR magic back instead of doing its own things. It definitely suffered for it. My other reason I don’t want him involved is aesthetics. Again LoTR is an amazing series and looks great, but now it feels like if fans see any lord of the rings art, games, costumes, etc if it’s not in the “Peter Jackson aesthetic” it somehow isn’t correct. 
So yeah I don’t want him involved so we can hopefully see something that hopefully charts it’s own course more so it can maybe stand next to the LOTR trilogy as it’s own thing to consider instead of under it like the Hobbit came to be. Just my thoughts."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"after the hobbit, maybe it’s just better to let someone else have a go"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,maybe they saw The Hobbits..?
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Tolkien Estate really hates Peter Jackson.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Interesting how ghosting happens at the high end corporate level. I get offended when a recruiter spontaneously stops responding to me.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I mean I would have ghosted him after the hobbit movies.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Is this really a big deal? Jackson didn't create LOTR, it's not his universe and story, he just made an excellent adaptation. Does Nolan need to be consulted on any future Batman movies? Raimi for Spider-Man movies?"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Sounds like what Disney did to Lucas. But Jackson didn’t create LOTR lest we forget
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Yeah, I'm not sure about the show, really, then again I find it hard to get into potentially multi-seasonal shows anyways. I enjoyed the Jackson films despite the differences and complaints people had.  It's just another's take on an established story when all is said and done.  The LotR films were really fun movies, and unless you dislike fantasy in general, I don't get how someone couldn't enjoy them for what they were.  If you want a story that follows the book, word for word, just re-read it.  Stories adapted to film never live up to the fantasy the written word presents to a  readers imagination.

If they were going to make a series out of anything, I'd have preferred the multitude of differing tales from the Silmarillion, personally."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Peter Jackson : *Can I see the script*?

Amazon : *Whats a script?*"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Peter Jackson quoted as telling Amazon, “Just don’t make this Elfishness of yours a Hobbit’"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Did Amazon pull out after they watched the hobbit?
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Maybe he backed out when they told him there would be an editor
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,[deleted]
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,The shows gunna be trash anyway oh well
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I believe Peter Jackson over Amazon
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"The trailers look awful, the characters look generic, and this is most likely Tolkien in name only and will just be a mish mash of popular current fantasy TV shows while occasionally using Tolkien settings and characters.

This is gonna be the most expensive fan fiction ever produced."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Unless Peter was willing to go for a a tv budget pay packet.  I can't imagine they could have afforded him.  But he did joke about directing a Doctor Who episode.  So I could be very wrong.

I imagine the story isn't that simple"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Prob cause he required 300m
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Anyone who was responsible for that Brontosaurus stampede scene in King Kong should have their movie making card revoked.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"> you’re likely going to get a fine and a slap on the wrists

The “fines” in NDAs aren’t the equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Breach confidentiality = lose a high paying non-writing EP job with higher episodic fees than most families make in a year on with 2 salaries."
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,[deleted]
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,I fully expect to be disappointed
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"This serie will flop, it’s full of woke-race-theory propaganda, amazon raped the original concept and that will make the lord of the rings lose its identity"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,i read peter as percy jackson and was EXTREMELY confused for a hot minute
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Good. The Hobbit was horrible.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,The series nobody asked for
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Calling it right now, this show sucks ass"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,This show is going to suck so fucking hard. Looking forward to being accused of being racist for hating it on Reddit
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Show is going to be awful
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,The death of borimir scene will be better than this whole saga 🤦🏻‍♂️
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Show is going to suck, he’s fortunate to not be involved"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Why should he be involved??
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,Odds are high it will go off the rails without Jackson at the helm.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"I think I’ll take Peter Jackson’s word over “Amazon” suggestions

Wtf"
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,love how he just shrugged it off like he don't give a shit. Which is probably the general sentiment for this incoming epically proportioned trainwreck
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,fuck that show. im already checked out
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,So ready for woke LOTR. Thanks Amazon.
Sherazade - The Untold Stories,"Dunno why the hype, they are gonna fuck  it up just like they did WoT"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",At some point she's got to start wondering why like half the people she meets turn out to be murderers
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Episode 5, Charlie, holding a cigarette, does an overt Colombo nod with a touch to the top of her head and saying, oh just one more thing....  I rewound and hooted!  Love it!"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",***Bullshit!***
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Fuck yes, I love this show! Excited to see the guest stars they can get for season two. The ones this season have been absolutely top-tier"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Give me ten more seasons! So delightfully fun
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Love the show!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",This show has been a pleasant surprise. Peacock has needed a strong original show in the worst way. I'm admittedly not a huge Natasha Lyonne person but this role suits her very well. Hopefully it gains further steam.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I've enjoyed this show so much. Lyonne is fantastic, the writing is very clever, and I've loved all of the different guest stars they've had each week. I've never been a big fan of procedurals, but this one is done very well. It reminds me a lot of Columbo. Glad to see we'll be getting another season."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Murder She Wrote was on for 12 years. You would think at some point Jessica Fletcher would ask herself, why is it whenever I’m around someone gets murdered?"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",yay!!! now i need season 2 to have 22 episodes
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Excited for this! Loving this show!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Fuck yes.
At first I was apprehensive about a murder mystery show where we know the who done it from the beginning but God I have fallen. In love with the structure and writing. It's so good."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Well deserved. This show has been an absolute treasure so far! Looking forward to the rest of this season!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Poker Face is seriously fire
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I really love this show. It’s so much fun.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Started strong then it gets ok. Mix of Columbo, The fugitive and whoever with special powers (the mentalist?). Episode 3 plot is lifted from a Columbo one, including the key sentence."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",No bullshit detected.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",It’s a really good show. I am glad to hear it!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Hmm, it felt pretty good from the start but its so formulaic it feels like diminishing returns as the episodes goes by. Maybe the episodes Rian directed himself were stronger also. Anyway, I would atleast say its not the most bingeable show."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Fuck yes. Loved the first 4 episodes. This also reminded me to catch up on it.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I just hope this can last more than two seasons.

Peacock's track record is just abysmal. All their shows are just two-and-done. I know people give Netflix flack for cancelling shows, but Peacock is much, much worse. I hope *Poker Face* is the exception."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I guess the universe has a balance: she’s gifted with reading people, but has no luck."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",If only it were on a good streaming service. It would get so many more viewers.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","She's kinda become the female Nathan Fillon, constant and successful TV lead work."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I don't remember that song being this long
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",If you don’t know this is the best “murder of the week” show since Psych.  The first episode is good but the tone changes after that so if the first episode is not your thing try till episode 3.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","For some reason I want to see Jake Johnson as a villain in this show, like playing as Charlie's Moriarty."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I like the show, mainly because I enjoy that 90s sarcasm Natasha does well. It does bother me me when people describe the show as a “mystery”. If you show whodunnit in the first 10 minutes, there’s no mystery."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I didn’t realize the show was this popular, but thank god because I want another season."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Currently on episode 4.

So far ive been loving it but i have to say >!the characters in episode 4 are just beyond stupid. Their ONLY successful hit has come from their former drummer and they are stuck living in her shadow. Then a new drummer comes around with fresh talent and a new hit and they FUCKING KILL HIM LIKE IMMEDIATELY???? Who is going to write their next big hit since they obviously suck? Why the fuck would you not take him on to make more songs?!<"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Season 2, Charlie meets a redditor and tells him to stop masturbating so much and take a shower.

He asks if she knew that because she used her secret abilities and she says ""you're on reddit"""
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I'm just not sure I'll ever understand the Natasha Lyonne-craze.

Obviously she's talented and good at what she does, and this is completely subjective,  but something about her whole shtick just...grates on me."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Very nice, I just want Natasha Lyonne to keep working!"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Too bad Natasha Lyonne already played herself in Glass Onion.  I'd be cool with a Rian Johnson shared whodunnit/howcatchem universe!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",will Natasha Lyonne ever play a different character? time will tell
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","They can renew it, but will they make it?  Peacock, where's We Are Lady Parts?"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Me too!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Great news. Good show
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I enjoyed the first episode but the second one lost me when it turned into a subway ad. I can tolerate a bit of product placement but that was beyond obnoxious.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Awesome for Natasha, loved the first few episodes but I’ve become extremely tired of the formula"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",The first 4 or so episodes were decent. Then something happened. I don't know if the writers changed or there's something else but the whole tone has switched into a bland crime of the week boring thing.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",okay now Netflix let’s do russian doll s3 pleaseee
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I’m loving the characters, writing and tone but I really wish that the formula wasn’t to show us the crime at the beginning of each episode. Knowing the answer really blunts the twists and turns of the case for me."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool"," She's a woman who has to stay below the radar because she's implicated in a death but also is at risk of being killed ... so she sticks around to solve crimes?

In the badly scripted diluted words of the protagonist ""bullshit"".

Columbo made sense because he was a detective. This protagonist is motivated to stay under the radar, but that's barely utilised. She will raise a fuss, be loud, get involved, be casual.  Why? Who is this woman, and what is her motivation?

They took the core concept of a legendary gambler who can read people and turned it into this!?

She should have gone on the run through underground poker games, and had various crimes and intrigues be necessary to be solved for her to get her winnings. And lean heavier on the ""4 hour time limit"".  

As it is this show is so loose and unmotivated that it lacks all tension or direction. Its just ""lets see Natasha say 'nyyyeerrr' a lot"" while we rearrange the scenery for her to mug around.  Its a waste of a premise"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Disappointing
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Show does look interesting but I struggled to make it through the trailer based off her voice alone. It's worse than nails on a chalkboard.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Let me guess 

Natasha Lyonne plays herself again"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Like anyone had any doubts with the money they dumped into their deal with Johnson. This series is mid at best but it has to succeed given the investment made. 

If you have Peacock, go check out Wolf Like Me instead because holy shit that series took me completely by surprise."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I find this woman endlessly irritating.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I was excited the first few eps but then started to see the formula. 10 eps = 10 different murders after right after she personally meets either every victim/murderer? She’s a dam jinx. Should’ve just made her a cop or detective or some shit like that new will Trent show, which is also good btw."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",They keep trying to make this lady happen.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I like the show overall but ngl, I'm not the biggest fan of the ""murder of the week"" format. The first episode seemed to imply it was going to be a serialized show but so far the episodes are very disconnected and heterogeneous. The events of the first episode shortly catch up to her at the end of the 3rd episode but it's inconsequential, I suppose they'll show us some kind of resolution on that front before the season ends."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I like this show, but I can see the formula going bad and it eventually starts to repeat itself. Also, the most recent episode sucked. Hope the new one this week is better."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Does anyone else notice that this show is basically Murder, She Wrote mixed with some CSI?"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I can't stand whatever over the top sleuthy type accent she's trying to pull off. Literally had to turn it off to escape her voice.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Disappointing. I couldn’t make it thru the first episode. Yet HULU killed Reboot which was pretty funny. 
Oh well"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Rian Johnson Star Wars Trilogy Ever Happening:

[X] Doubt"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Yeah Rian’s Star Wars trilogy is definitely dead now :/
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",What about the guy chasing her?  Wasn’t THAT the point of the show?
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Worst show ever!!! Worst than Velma!!!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",She's been riding that American Pie character for all these years and it's still working.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I guess if people like it, whatever.  Not my cup of tea at all.  I thought it was going to be something else entirely.  The whole premise is ridiculous because that's just not how anything works.  She has a weird superpower....okay.  But then also why is she encountering murders everywhere she goes?  Murders are rare, and most homicides are gang/crime related, but she's stumbling on these random murders everywhere she goes which is just more unrealistic nonsense on top of the superpower.
 
But by far the worst offender is that this is episodic television in 2023."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",[removed]
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I can’t seem to find how to watch this in Canada!! The most frustrating thing about these new streaming sites like Peacock that we don’t have the equivalent here and it’s hard to find the shows.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I hardly knew her!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",No idea what this is but I have Peacock. Is it any good and what other originals are  worth the time on Peacock?
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",hopefully we can get this show in Canada
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Yet we can’t get a second season of Reboot.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","As good news as this is, it doesn't give me much hope that the current arc will be resolved this season."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I’m cool with this but! Is it going to get in the way of more ‘Russian Doll?’ Because, that would not be cool!!"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",She’s so hot
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Best news of the day!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Wait, Peacock can acctually renew shows?"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Great news - I love this show!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Nice!! This is a fun show!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I enjoy the show. They show the murder, and later reveal that Charlie was present later on. Her art of deduction and memory recall is how the crime is pieced together, a la Columbia style."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Where did this actress come from? Never heard of her and suddenly she seems to be all over the place!
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I want one episode a season to be about her solving like a financial crime or something just to switch it up.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","At least it's not like *Murder, She Wrote* taking place in one small town. I remember seeing an article awhile back demonstrating that Cabot Cove was basically the murder capital of the world."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","That’s pretty much every murder mystery show about a private detective. They all tend to stumble across murders constantly, even when they’re just going about their own business."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","The thing I find amusing is she actually *causes* some of the murders.  Like in the BBQ episode, >!she gives the brother all the DVDs that lead to him becoming vegetarian!<, and in the band one, >!she encourages the drummer to show the band his song!<.  So, it's not just that she's meeting murderers, she's inadvertently setting up the situations that lead to the murders.  Had she not met the people, they might still be alive."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Jessica Fletcher Syndrome

EDIT:  Damnit...of course she's already been mentioned like 5 times."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I thought about that too, but there seems to be a spiritual angle to it.

She tried to use her powers for selfish needs, and it almost got her killed, then she stopped using them altogether and that almost got her killed.

So she decided to try and use them to help people, especially after first episode, and now it’s like there’s a guiding hand taking her where good people need her help.

Almost like my name is Earl, but with a different twist"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I swear she makes a comment about that. I believe I heard it in a trailer where she says “I’m like a magnet for murder.” Something to that affect
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I kinda love this subgenre of murder (not much of a) mystery shows. In the UK when I was a kid there was a show called Rosemary & Thyme about two gardener's that just kept discovering crimes and dead bodies and helped solve them. Suspend your disbelief, enjoy the cosy television show."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","I love the show but this is my only gripe. Would love to see a different array of crimes and not only murders. I think they eventually start to switch it up, it'll get stale otherwise."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Never seemed to bother Jessica Fletcher
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","At some point, we’re going to have to start wondering why she keeps confronting murderers after she knows what they did, and why she hasn’t been killed outright. 

Like in episode 1 (spoilers), she knows what they did, she already had evidence, she already told the casino whale what they were planning… and yet she still went there to confront them. The dude just committed a double assassination, and she’s just walking in there going ‘well actually, I recorded you earlier…’

I’m amazed she survives long enough to be in a season 2."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","It’s literally the same thing every episode. The 1st episode was really good but then they just decided to repeat the same concept every episode only changing the characters, location, and how the the person was murdered. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a show with such lazy writing."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Psych did a pretty good job with this. A few seasons in, they started having episodes without murder. 

Another thing from Psych that PokerFace can learn from is having an explanation for her ability. Maybe that's planned, but I'm also tired of people just accepting it. I want to see how she got it."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Jessica didn’t in Murder She Wrote 😂
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","My own pet theory is that she has the power to draw out people's deepest desires when in close proximity. It's not always evil desires either. Like the guy who became a vegan after watching the DVD of Okja she gave him. 
She has this weird energy... a gift and a curse.  Kinda ties into her ability of detecting a lie. She sees the true individual behind the facade and is therefore able to gently influence them. 

I'm talking out my arse but it's fun to theorise."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",Yea it gets bit tedious after some time
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I'm hoping for an episode where her lie detector takes her down the completely wrong path because the people she's talking to are lying about multiple things at once.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",I mean it is a murder mystery.... people get murdered for various reasons
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Why are people in musicals always breaking into songs?  Why don't more Greek tragedies have happy endings?  If there are only seven people on Gilligan's Island, where is that laughter coming from?"
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Check the opening credits of an episode of Poker Face against an episode of Columbo.  The same yellow font superimposed over the opening scenes, no theme music.  It's on purpose."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","She is so the new Colombo, first thing I thought after seeing first episode."
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool",*whispers* truth.
"Crazy, Lovely, Cool","Knives Out - ""Eat Shit""
Glass Onion - ""Shitheads""
Poker Face - ""Bullshit""

Can't wait to see what phrase Rian chooses next."
Crash Landing on You,"The original was so beautiful, I'm not sure how I feel about a remake, especially with a Sci fi component. Part of the magic was the chemistry with the two leads (such great chemistry that they married and recently had a child), will lightning strike twice?"
Crash Landing on You,Why choose such a highly specific kdrama? There are so many that would be easy to remake! In fact many *have* had foreign remakes. Why not going with a crime thriller like Tunnel or Signal?
Crash Landing on You,"So it's basically Outlander 2.0, but let's call it Crash Landing on You, cause why not? 

I mean, I have no issues with remakes, but if the original one is based on a geopolitical situation that is very specific to the two Koreas how can you even adapt it to the USA without changing literally the whole story?"
Crash Landing on You,Never heard of this show. The story sounds great. Is the original show good?
Crash Landing on You,Deplorable
Crash Landing on You,"Yeah, because imagine the shitstorm on the internet if it was a story about an American woman paragliding accidentally flies into Mexico and crashes. A Mexican soldier helps her cross the border and they fall in love"
Crash Landing on You,Let’s see how Escape From New York this gets
Crash Landing on You,"plus it's already been done multiple times.

Starman, the man that fell to earth, etc.."
Crash Landing on You,It'd be pretty funny if the premise was they got stuck in Canada and that was bad for some reason.
Crash Landing on You,"The original is very good. Tho it is a kdrama, so it's hard to tell if it's something you'd like or not. I'd personally say give it a shot."
Crash Landing on You,It’s great! But I really can’t see how any kind of remake could work.
Crash Landing on You,If youre into kdramas i consider it one of the best
Crash Landing on You,"It wouldn't be much of a story. If you accidentally crossed the border, all you have to do is go to the nearest American Consulate to get papers that will get you back to the states."
Crash Landing on You,"That would be hilarious, aye."
Crash Landing on You,"I never watched it but I think there's a kimchi making scene. I wonder what the Canadian equivalent would have been there. Maple syrup? Buttertarts? Poutine? Ooh what if she's stuck in Newfoundland and they're making pickled seal flippers or something. I think that's a thing, I saw Top Chef Canada once."
Crash Landing on You,So how's the remake gonna work exactly? An american girl accidentally paraglides over Russian territories?
Crash Landing on You,"Just fucking why netflix

Crash landing on you got me to watch like 10 other kdramas before I realized nothing's going to be as enjoyable for me as CLoY

Why does it need an american remake, you going to land in canada?  The fuck"
Crash Landing on You,So...a period drama set during the Civil War?
Crash Landing on You,"An American girl accidentally skydives into Notcuba, a Caribbean island nation with an authoritarian government stuck in the 1960s, whose resemblance to any real nation will never be addressed or commented upon.

Seriously, this premise only works for North Korea. There is really no other state like it in the world."

Crash Landing on You,It would probably work for a divided germany
Crash Landing on You,"In my opinion, it's not worth going to the trouble and expense of re-dividing Germany just to make the premise of this show work."
Crash Landing on You,What We Do in the Shadows is the best new comedy in ages.
Crash Landing on You,"Succession, Chernobyl, white lotus"
Crash Landing on You,"Ted Lasso,  Succession, A.P. Bio .. there's quite a few out there."
Crash Landing on You,"Corporate, I Think You Should Leave"
Crash Landing on You,"1. Kingdom - The film was disappointing
2. Vinland Saga
3. Chernobyl
4. Succession
5. Fruits Basket (2019)
6. Squid Game
7. The Boys
8. When They See Us
9. Invincible

A bit of a mixed list. I started to try more Korean series and they are pretty good."
Crash Landing on You,The Other Two is top tier
Crash Landing on You,"Succession, mare of East Town, Ted lasso, the boys, Yellowstone, Dave, perry Mason, altered carbon, the righteous gemstones, marvelous Mrs Maisel, dead to me, you, watchman, chernobyl"
Crash Landing on You,"What we do in the shadows, reservation dogs"
Crash Landing on You,"Succession is my current favorite, can't wait for Season 3!"
Crash Landing on You,"My Brilliant Friend isn't a miniseries. There were 2 seasons and a third will be broadcasted sometime early next year, I'm hoping for this year. There are more seasons to come to going by the books. The show is ongoing and is not over yet."
Crash Landing on You,Loved **My Brilliant Friend** and **ZeroZeroZero**
Crash Landing on You,I wanted to like Succession but was really put of by the shaky cam from episode 1. Is it worth me trying again? I coped with 2008 and I promised myself never again.
Crash Landing on You,"Sex Education, hands down."
Crash Landing on You,"I know it only started last week, but I'm blown away by Foundation. I've watched it 3 times this week."
Crash Landing on You,"Looking through my past few top 10 lists: Haunting of Hill House, My Brilliant Friend, Pose, Watchmen, Ramy, For All Mankind, Mrs. America, Devs, The Circle, The Queen's Gambit, Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, The Mandalorian, The Good Lord Bird, Reservation Dogs"
Crash Landing on You,Pen15
Crash Landing on You,What we do in the shadows is a hidden gem. Filmed like the office but with vampires. Pretty entertaining.
Crash Landing on You,"Primal, Ted Lasso, Every single marvel show, The Mandalorian."
Crash Landing on You,Derry Girls. Scenes from a Marriage. Ted Lasso. Crash Landing on You.
Crash Landing on You,I think it's a great thread
Crash Landing on You,Hands down. The whole ensemble is fantastic.
Crash Landing on You,HBO gang!
Crash Landing on You,White lotus was terrible
Crash Landing on You,"Yeah, Corporate really doesn't get mentioned enough.  One of the better Comedy Central shows in quite a while. Good to see someone else liked it too."
Crash Landing on You,"I'm sorry about that it's a typo. 😅 Obviously some copy and pasting was done here. As you can see I put ""2 seasons (ongoing)"" and still for some reason have ""miniseries"" beneath it. My bad lol."
Crash Landing on You,Crazy how these two are so different and yet they are also on some of the best shows I saw in 2020-21. I stumbled across Brilliant Friend on a work trip in the hotel room and ZeroZeroZero led me to Gomorra which was probably my favorite of the three.
Crash Landing on You,💕
Crash Landing on You,I found that really annoying and distracting as well. Sometimes I was on the verge of motion sickness and had to take breaks. But either I got used to it or it stopped/decreased because I can't remember being bothered by it throughout and I made it through both seasons.
Crash Landing on You,Definitely Primal. Hard to believe how good it is honestly.
Crash Landing on You,Did you watch the 3rd episode?
Crash Landing on You,The prevailing theme I've seen with this attitude is that it's usually from the kind of people White Lotus was satirizing.
Crash Landing on You,"If that is true, perhaps some people don't like seeing themselves portrayed harshly again and again and made to feel shame."
Crash Landing on You,What kind of people would that be? I’m a Black woman with a working class background.
Crash Landing on You,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"
Crash Landing on You,"I agree but for my favorites are a bit different than yours. I really liked the Mandalorian, Watchmen, His Dark Materials, The Imagineering Story, and The Boys. 2019 was also a pretty good year for movies too but that's a different topic lol"
Crash Landing on You,"Thank you, discovered Dead Pixels from this and will try it esp as I loved Mythic Quest"
Crash Landing on You,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. 😩"
Crash Landing on You,Holy shit. 100% forgot that Watchmen was 2019. lol.
Crash Landing on You,You're welcome. 😊
Crash Landing on You,"We've gone mainstream, initiate protocol omega"
Crash Landing on You,"Useless facts: Peaky Blinders series became popular in Brazil (who gets most of the portuguese viewers) this year because of a guy from Big Brother Brazil who cut his hair like Thomas Shelby and said it was because of show, which is one of his favorites."
Crash Landing on You,Better call saul nailed it with the latest season.
Crash Landing on You,Good for Community.
Crash Landing on You,"""Money Heist"" was always such a stupid translation. What was wrong with just calling it ""House of Paper""? It would lose the 0.2% of potential viewers who didn't realise what it was about?"
Crash Landing on You,/u/wikirank please do this every month
Crash Landing on You,Japan dgaf about foreign shows lol
Crash Landing on You,"Money Heist has got to be the most average show to his this level of popularity. 

Every single episode follows the same exact formula. Issue happens —> Characters talk about feelings or flashbacks —> Professor says something —> More talks about feelings —> Show an outside authority and how corrupt they are —> The episodes conflict is resolved in a second —> Put a cheesy cliffhanger for next episodes. 

Rinse and repeat. 

And then all seasons are the carbon copy of the ones before. Seriously.

This show’s success always amazes me. Such incredibly low quality writing and boring events outside of S1."
Crash Landing on You,"With all the walking dead hate I see all the time here, how did it make it to top 10? Lol"
Crash Landing on You,Ozark is so damn good!
Crash Landing on You,Prison Break and Suits are kind of surprising.
Crash Landing on You,You’d definitely see this list dominated by Game of Thrones if it ended better. I’m surprised to even see it in the bottom 5
Crash Landing on You,"Koh-Lanta isn't a TV series, it's the French version of the Survivor reality show."
Crash Landing on You,The world of the married is pretty good and a complete clusterfuck. It is based after the BBC’s Dr Foster
Crash Landing on You,I never even heard of Money Heist - is this actually any good or just trash?
Crash Landing on You,So I guess I need to go see what money heist is... Never even heard of it till now
Crash Landing on You,"The top 3 in Spanish wiki is exactly what I was expecting, but totally didn't expect The Good Doctor at #4."
Crash Landing on You,TIL there’s a Japanese version of *Suits*.
Crash Landing on You,"Money Heist is a such a USA series like Burn Notice,Suits etc. Extremely predictable but fun fluff"
Crash Landing on You,*Supernatural* is truly large in Russia lol. The only country where it cracked the top 10.
Crash Landing on You,Star Trek Picard being on any popular list is laughable.
Crash Landing on You,Damn
Crash Landing on You,"i've heard there is a cult of the show there, a fandom seems more likely though."
Crash Landing on You,Prior?
Crash Landing on You,First time they've had a season with any kind of pace to it. I love the show but the pacing is glacial.
Crash Landing on You,Good news for a potential movie too.
Crash Landing on You,Is the show any good after S3?
Crash Landing on You,[deleted]
Crash Landing on You,I suppose they thought people would confuse it with House of Cards
Crash Landing on You,Wow is Money Heist that good though? I didn’t realize it was THIS popular. May need to check it out.
Crash Landing on You,"It's not translated in France so everyone knows it as ""la casa de papel"". And they sometimes translate series or movies name. I don't know when they choose to do so or not. Probably depends if the name is easy to say or to understand.

They did translate it in Québec though but kept the ""House of Paper"" meaning."
Crash Landing on You,"I actively put off watching it for the longest time because of the title. Also, the clunkiness of the phrase 'Money Heist' (like what else are you going to steal in  a heist but money? - although it makes sense when watching the show) made me presume the quality of any translation would be poor, which isn't actually the case."
Crash Landing on You,"in Germany its called The House of Money, which is okay I guess"
Crash Landing on You,Wouldn't Paperhouse also work?
Crash Landing on You,It’s a dumb translation but doesn’t take anything away from the show itself
Crash Landing on You,Maybe English copyright issues.
Crash Landing on You,"""House of Paper"" makes it sound like either a spinoff or rip-off of House of Cards, *or* some contemplative, slow, period drama about upper class women dreading their place in society in early Edwardian England."
Crash Landing on You,"If it wasn't called Money Heist, I probably would never have watched it."
Crash Landing on You,Cause you try to translate it into the most eye-grabbing name that tells you what the show is about.
Love and Lies,"I loved how they didn't take themselves too seriously in the final season as well.

Singing ""U + Ur hand"" to a group a Nazis and ""I had the time of my life"" for the final showdown."
Love and Lies,"Emily Hampshire is really good in this, she plays Brad Pitt's character from the movies."
Love and Lies,"Deacon is in this season of Picard. 

I am just now finding out that Picard has a lot of 12 Monkeys references because they share some of the same writers or something?"
Love and Lies,"Love this show, causality and fixed time loops scratch that itch in my brain so good."
Love and Lies,A show with a perfect ending. It's rare you get a show that wraps everything up so nicely.
Love and Lies,"Some of my favorite shows of all time are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Mr. Robot, The Leftovers, Dark, and Bojack Horseman.

I put 12 Monkeys in the same category. It is that good.

It is overlooked and dismissed for some unfair reasons: (1) It is based on the movie. But the show goes WAY BEYOND the source material and becomes it's own story. The show is levels better than the movie. (2) It was on SyFy which has a somewhat deserved reputation of airing crap. 12 Monkeys should have been on AMC (when AMC meant something)."
Love and Lies,Really liked the ending.Fun ride for sure.
Love and Lies,For those who haven't watched - it's a really fun and satisfying show. The cast is great and every single mystery set up during the show is answered by the end of the excellent series finale.
Love and Lies,[deleted]
Love and Lies,"Show runner and writer Terry Matalas is currently killing it on season 3 of Picard, which is poetic seeing how dude made his bones on DS9 and has now come full circle."
Love and Lies,Probably my favorite show of all time. Definitely the best time travel show of all time. Watch it.
Love and Lies,"My film professor in college absolutely hated this series and I never understood why. It's a bit campy and doesn't take itself too seriously but for what it is, it's a great show."
Love and Lies,It's not prestigious TV or anything but it's damn good scifi and just fun! Definitely got one of the best endings of a show.
Love and Lies,"One of my all-time favorite shows! We were just talking about it the other day. I'm so glad we got to see it all the way to the end and that it didn't get cancelled halfway through like so many others. 

99 Luftballoons was just a bonus none of us knew we needed."
Love and Lies,Travelers is a good time travel show
Love and Lies,"I thought it was pretty entertaining and certainly doesn't get the respect it deserves compared to other recent sci-fi programming. The woman basically playing the Brad Pitt character had a great run - she went from being a bit annoying to the show stealer.

Still had some issues though. The baddies were like comic book baddies, it might have been more interesting if they were more nuanced. Sometimes character motivations felt forced to make the time loops still work. And the usual stuff where it falls apart if you think about it too hard (They will reject an obvious solution because it might ""affect the timeline"", then the next episode they do something way more drastic in the past and it's seemingly not a problem.)"
Love and Lies,This show was great. Might be time for a rewatch
Love and Lies,"Well based on the comments here, I'll have to give it a go!"
Love and Lies,"I'm struggling a bit with Season 1. I know the show is supposed to get better, but the editing/writing/music feel very 2015 SyFy (which is hardly surprising I guess). 

Does it shake some of this off in the later seasons?"
Love and Lies,One of the few shows I'll watch at least yearly all the way through. Amazing television.
Love and Lies,Love this show so much.
Love and Lies,This show is one of my favourite shows of all time. It’s entertaining and time travel actually makes sense. Very well written and underrated for sure.
Love and Lies,"This show was a ""secret tip"" over 5 years ago... But there are still people who had never heard of it. 

This show is one of my all-time favorite shows."
Love and Lies,This is probably the best time travel show I have ever seen and probably the best sci-fi show show after Fringe for me.
Love and Lies,"I've definitely watched this show. But honestly I cant remember really anything from it. 
A showdown in a warehouse? 

Was it really that good? How comes I don't remember what happens in it. Hmm."
Love and Lies,"It's a shame that many, many people quit this show during the first season altough the story hasn't begun yet. It takes time to unfold. This is one of the best written shows and it has the BEST FINALE ever. Better than Six Feet Under. Better than Breaking Bad. It has no plotholes (which is insane because it's time travel) and you can even watch it backwards and it still makes sense.

Don't even get me started on one of the best characters ever developed: Jennifer. What a delight. THIS is how you write strong women, dear Hollywood!

What a masterpiece!
10/10"
Love and Lies,I stopped somewhere S02. Dont know why
Love and Lies,"Fantastic show, where does it stream?"
Love and Lies,"Absolutely loved this show. Been trying to chase a similar show to scratch the itch for time travel and/or epic scifi ever since, and just can't find one. Closest thing was probably Continuum. But Battlestar and 12 Monkeys are probably my two favorite epic sagas."
Love and Lies,"I stopped watching, because while it had good scifi and concepts, it felt like the same antagonist/situation season after season."
Love and Lies,"great show
always recommend it"
Love and Lies,"I loved Nikita, and since this show had a bunch of that cast and I always enjoyed the movie I checked it out. I remember enjoying the first season but just kinda stopped watching after a while, I need to get back into it one day, always heard good things."
Love and Lies,Same show runner for the new season of Picard which is night and day different quality from the first awful 2 seasons of Picard.
Love and Lies,"I never knew there was a show, will check it out."
Love and Lies,I've seen the movie.  Didn't know there was a show.
Love and Lies,"This show, Black Sails, and The Leftovers have been among the most satisfying series for me in recent years. They are exceptional, and worth investing the time into.

12 Monkeys is a carefully planned and well executed time travel story that will have you on your toes for the duration of your first viewing, and if you rewatch you will get the pay off of seeing how lovingly the puzzle got masterfully shifted into place. 

Genuinely one of my all-time favourite TV shows."
Love and Lies,"The movie was brilliant, if depressing. I never even heard of this show till now."
Love and Lies,I still watch full series every few years. A good example of how a reimagining / reboot can work.
Love and Lies,You really can see the actors and writers having fun.
Love and Lies,"wasn't a huge fan of the movie, hows the show in comparison?

edit: alright i'm convinced. going to potentially binge it this weekend!"
Love and Lies,"Loved this show. So we’ll done. As much as I would have liked more seasons, it ended well and feels complete."
Love and Lies,I loved this show. Definitely worth a watch.
Love and Lies,Aaron Stanford should be a bigger star than he is
Love and Lies,"I haven't seen it in a while but I remember thinking it went on for too long. They had a great reveal of who the villain was but then it felt like thet got renewed for more episodes and had to add a 'actually, this was the real villain all along'."
Love and Lies,"If you get past the fact that the show is a reboot/reimagining of the original movie premise, then it is a really fun watch. They really fleshed out the characters and just took it in a whole new direction. The movie is definitely in my top 10 list. I love Terry Gilliam movies and the heartbreakingly beautiful closed loop time travel paradox ending will always be a cinema high to me."
Love and Lies,"i liked it, i watched it until the thing with the baby and it was too much."
Love and Lies,"My favorite TV show of all time. Great story, time travel is very thrilling and keeps you invested, but even the best of stories is nothing without great characters and this series has amazing characters. By the end of it I was very invested emotionally in the characters. Also, the best finale I've ever watched, which is very hard to get right."
Love and Lies,In this thumbnail that guy could’ve already shot her. Shows use guns so stupidly and it doesn’t add to the excitement at all. Basically TV writers have no respect for or connection to other people and are all Michael Scott.
Love and Lies,Couldn’t the guy in the picture quickly scoot slightly to his left and take the shot with her head turned?
Love and Lies,Someone must have never seen futurama
Love and Lies,"Man that show was an insult to the source material. 

Y'all like that show but hated Cowboy Bebop is sure a indictment to objectivity."
Love and Lies,"I wish the true ending was the bleaker one, but still enjoyed the show."
Love and Lies,I think Dark has something to say about this
Love and Lies,"I'm on like the third season. It was pretty stupid. Time travel has no rules.

Alisen Down is great. She's been great for over 20 years though."
Love and Lies,I gave up on this in the first episode where the watch got a scratch carved into it.
Love and Lies,Good summer binge show
Love and Lies,"The first season was great. 

They really put a lot of great seeds into the fact that climate change was going to destroy the world, so by saving everyone you'd be dooming the planet, etc. 

Then I guess there was a showrunner change or SOMETHING because season 2 went completely off the rails. I stopped watching but I don't think it got more on-track ever."
Love and Lies,[deleted]
Love and Lies,"Been thinking alot about this show lately, especially when ""red flowers"" became a device on ""LA Brea""."
Love and Lies,Where can 12 monkeys be streamed in the US?
Love and Lies,"I think I forgot about it. The movie was a real trip - if the show is that good, I need to watch it."
Love and Lies,"Where can we watch this? Indian here. HBO content is on Hotstar for your reference. 

Lionsgate, Hulu are shared between Prime and Hotstar."
Love and Lies,Started drinking whiskey sours because of this show.
Love and Lies,There is a show? Is it based on the movie?
Love and Lies,"This is the show I truly want to ""make"" people watch, and just don't know how."
Love and Lies,Does any of it take place (or was filmed in) Philly?
Love and Lies,They made a TV show??? Now I need to check it out.
Love and Lies,Wait does the series have anything to do with the movie?
Love and Lies,"Just kickstarted my weekend binge. Loved this show, haven’t watched a 2nd time yet."
Love and Lies,"Forced myself to watch all of it after seeing it hyped to high heavens online. It was.... okay? I most definitely prefer the original Terry Gilliam film to it. After seeing articles like this one and seeing gushing praise on the internet I expected something much, much better."
Love and Lies,Is this related to the bruce willis movie? Should I watch this instead of the movie?
Love and Lies,Very nice
Love and Lies,An actress that has shown great depth is Emily Hampshire and the comparison between her 12 Monkeys and Schitt’s Creek’s roles is pretty amazing.
Love and Lies,"""U + Ur hand"" really works because of how they work the shows theme tune into it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDEgASduaR8"
Love and Lies,>!Did we just save hitler?!< is one of my all time favourite lines from a show.
Love and Lies,"I watched few seasons until the baby, can you quickly recap how the story ended?"
Love and Lies,Dude spoiler!
Love and Lies,"Emily Hampshire and Kirk Acevedo absolutely carried this show. Everyone on it was good, but those two stole every scene either of them were in."
Love and Lies,Upgrade!
Love and Lies,Movies plural? Was there a sequel to 12 monkeys that I didn’t know about
Love and Lies,Shame about *The Rig*.
Love and Lies,Terry Matalas created 12 Monkeys. He's in charge of Season 3 of Picard (finally this show is good. It's the Terry Matalas Effect). He leaves Easter eggs legt and right in this show.
Love and Lies,"'James Cole' was listed as one of Jack's aliases, and Cole himself played the Ferengi gangster who named a drug 'splinter'.

Also Athan Cole and Robert Gale were in season 2."
Love and Lies,"Yeah, Todd Stashwick is the most interesting part of Picard S3 so far, so I'm definitely curious about 12 Monkeys now"
Love and Lies,Seasons 2 & 3 of Picard have the same show runner (Terry Matalas).
Love and Lies,I agree! I've been wanting to go back and rewatch this after recently watching Dark.
Love and Lies,So glad I saw this. Never heard of the show before but I’m 4 episodes in now and I’m loving it.
Love and Lies,Crazy that SyFy just dumped the final season like they did but am so glad it got wrapped up.
Love and Lies,"I feel the exact opposite.  I thought the finale destroyed the show with fan service.  Definitely a bad landing, almost as bad as GoT."
Love and Lies,"All shows that absolutely nailed the ending. Though I would have been fine if Bojack went a little more dark >!to really drive home that you dont have unlimited chances to fuck up.!< 

I agree that it being on syfy kept eyes off it which was a shame cause that was a short window where syfy was firing on all cylinders. 12 Monkeys, The Magicians, The Expanse were all in that era and are all amazing shows."
Love and Lies,"I just finished Dark last night. Still not sure what to think. I loved the first two seasons, but then found season 3 to be an absolute slog."
Love and Lies,I still consider it one of the best shows ever. It really should be studied in film schools because of how tight it's constructed and written. Also one of the most satisfying endings.
Love and Lies,[deleted]
Love and Lies,"ok, this convinced me to watch it. The movie was ok, not bad but not great as well. Probably the reason why I didn't want to watch the show. I will give it a shot."
Love and Lies,Is there a place to watch it streaming right now?
Love and Lies,I think I’ll watch it based on this comment thank you. Same level as dark and mr robot? Sign me up!
Love and Lies,"Do I need to have seen the movie to enjoy the tv show?

Edit: having discovered the magicians a year or so ago I have changed my tune on syfy shows and am willing to give them a couple episodes of viewing and judge them on their merits. I was definitely one of those “2s” not too long ago"
Love and Lies,So I read this comment a few days ago and decided to give it a shot because I love breaking bad and better call saul. The plot seems very cool and I love some good time travels stories but the writing is lazy. How many times are they going to have a bad guy at gun point only to hesitate shooting so an explosion can go off and they can escape. It's happened so much that I had to find this comment and say thank you for the recommendation because I am enjoying the show but I can't even begin to put it on the same level as BCS or breaking bad.
Love and Lies,Legion comes to mind.
Love and Lies,Interesting to me that you felt they added filler in those seasons. Season 3 and 4 were mapped out from start to finish after season 2 so everything was planned out. I guess I can understand some instances but at that point the show was just having so much fun I didn't care in the slightest.
Princess Hours,"I mean yes. Most of the shows you listed are pretty average to bad and I don’t see any of the excellent TV listed from this past year:

Succession

The White Lotus

Black Bird

The Old Man

Slow Horses

Severance 

Bad Sisters

Five Days at Memorial

The Offer

Try those out, you won’t be disappointed."
Princess Hours,I'm rewatching The Deuce in the absence of anything good that's new.
Princess Hours,"This is or... *was* suppose to be the update for my [winter-spring compilation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/voazid/the_best_and_worst_tv_shows_of_2022_so_far_winter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).   
  
I think I'm gonna go back to making single posts for each review, because I've realized writing a review right after I watch a show might've given me motivation to watch a lot of these shows in the first place.  
  
Anyways, recommendations are welcome as to what 2022 show I should watch and review next, cuz I don't even know what the fuck is happening anymore (*don't be obvious tho lol*)."
Princess Hours,I've already lost it years ago. [In the late 00s](https://i.imgur.com/yv9nc8Q.png) used to watch close to 30 series a week [now I barely watch 2-3.](https://i.imgur.com/rb3Ab80.png)
Princess Hours,"Recently watched Slow Horses and Severance, both slapped."
Princess Hours,goddamn. how's the new season of Archer tho?
Princess Hours,Still decent. Not as good as the early seasons though.
Princess Hours,"Glad to see Spartacus at #1. One of the most entertaining shows I've ever watched. Andy Whitfield was fantastic. Liam McIntyre did a very nice job trying to fill in his shoes though, and the show had some great side characters and villains."
Princess Hours,"Don't get me wrong, I fucking loved Spartacus but Black Sails is hands down a better show. It's on a completely different level. "
Princess Hours,Black Sails
Princess Hours,Great review. I love Spartacus and Black Sails. Now I'm gonna have to give Outlander a try.
Princess Hours,Now who in the hell put Black Sails at 8?
Princess Hours,"The thing about Spartacus that is so underrated is the unique dialogue it had.  I guess it's not for everyone, but I loved it.  The mixing of quasi-Shakespearean rhythm with the vulgarity was just so damn amazing.

> Words fall from mouth as shit from ass."
Princess Hours,"The Girlfriend Experience introduced me to Riley Keough, and for that it's one of my favourite shows ever. I love Black Sails and Ash vs Evil Dead, and Party Down is really funny and personal too, but nothing can top The Girlfriend Experience for me."
Princess Hours,"Party Down's other downfall was losing Jane Lynch to ""Glee"" and Adam Scott to ""Parks and Rec"".  
  
I fucking love it, though. Rob Thomas did amazing things with Veronica Mars, and it was great to see so many people involved with that show involved in something completely different. "
Princess Hours,"I love *American Gods* and *Party Down*.

I still really want to check out *Black Sails* too. Maybe I should check out some of these other series though. *Outlander* sounds interesting. Thanks for the write-up."
Princess Hours,Just came to throw my support behind Spartacus. It was an extraordinary show indeed. Definitely within my top three favorite shows ever. Your appraisal does justice to the show so I won't bother adding my two cents. Starz really has some high quality shows that get criminally overlooked at the Emmys and other award events.
Princess Hours,"I'm glad to see Spartacus get some respect. It really doesn't the attention it deserves, and I'd put it at the 2nd best action show of all time, behind Buffy (with Banshee being 3rd, marred by a budget-starved final season.)

Black Sails, though... it's a show that does period politics and action better than Game of Thrones, arguably, and gets a 10th of the buzz. The naval battles look real to the point where I was left wondering how they did them. The characters were *all* complex and interesting. It's a rock-solid work of art."
Princess Hours,"I was getting upset that I didn't see Spartacus then I got to number 1 and I grinned :)

That was John Hannah's best role. It was an amazing ride and sad that Andy Whitfield lost his battle."
Princess Hours,I can't wait to see where Power goes for S4
Princess Hours,Nice write up. Appreciate the love for Flesh and Bone. Awesome show
Princess Hours,But they ruined Torchwood.
Princess Hours,"Don't shit on Survivor's Remorse. It's not winning an Emmy, but it's pretty entertaining, if you like sports. Especially in recent years as NBA and NFL prospects are getting younger and younger."
Princess Hours,I respect your write up but your list is rubbish. Differing opinions I suppose.
Princess Hours,"Black Sails is my favourite, but I've only seen half of these shows (only Outlander, The Girlfriend Experience, Flesh and Bone and Ash). I'd put it something like this:

1. Black Sails 2. The Girlfriend Experience 3. Outlander 4. Ash 5. Flesh and Bone"
Princess Hours,"I was about to say ""How the fuck did you leave out Banshee?"" but then I remembered that was Cinemax.

Nice list."
Princess Hours,"Man, Pillars of the Earth was really good. As a big fan of Follet's book (it's really, really good and you should read it if you're at all into medieval based fiction) I really had no complaints at all about Starz's adaptation... But unfortunately, the follow up miniseries, World Without End, was *terrible*.  Did Starz do that as well? I have to assume they did because (IIRC) it was all the same actors. 

I've only watched the first episode of the White Princess and thought it was only okay, roughly on par with the White Queen. A little mediocre, but I'll take it because it's set in a period I find interesting. "
Princess Hours,"1) Outlander
2) Black Sails
3) Spartacus"
Princess Hours,"As someone who has seen most of the shows on this list, Black Sails is #1 and it's not even really close at all."
Princess Hours,Great article!
Princess Hours,"Spartacus wasn't the same for me without Andy Whitfield and John Hanna, and I kind of trailed off some time in the second season.

Outlander is very good, but the violence in it is very disturbing to me, and the constant threat of violence and rape to Claire just made me stop watching (whereas the cartoonish violence of Spartacus didn't bother me). 

Ash is fine. Bruce Campbell is great. But it's kind of a bubble show for me and I never finished the first season.

I liked Girlfriend Experience and will be glad to see another season. Flesh and Bone was pretty addictive in a melodramatic way. If I were in the business, it'd be totally cringey, though.

I'm warming up to American Gods. Like Hannibal, AG gets  indulgent. At least with Hannibal, most people are familiar with the character and the show at least started out as more or less a police procedural. AG gives you very little to grasp on to for the first few episodes beside style and good performances (I did not read the book). But it's definitely not boring and I'm watching the rest. "
Princess Hours,"okay, **Survivor's Remorse** is dope and was much better than the completely ridic Flesh & Bone. (and this is coming from someone who *loves* dark & broody dance suspense...) definitely deserved a spot in the Top 10. 

"
Princess Hours,It's either going to be Outlander or American Gods.
Princess Hours,"Boss:  I thought the two seasons made where outstanding - I wish it would have lasted longer.

I am really enjoying Black Sails, Outlander, Power, and Survivor's Remorse.  "
Princess Hours,I loved Boss. I also worked near where they filmed a lot of it and Kelsey Grammer was excellent.
Princess Hours,"I love **American Gods** and **Ash vs Evil Dead**.

I tried the first couple **Black Sails** and couldn't get into it. I'll have to give it another go soon."
Princess Hours,"Of the ones I have seen, Ash vs Evil Dead is far and away their best show, adhering both to the spirit of the source material, and remaining campy and fun. It remains to be seen how long this will remain fresh and fun, but so far it's held its own. The first season is clearly better than the second, however. Though, it is fair to note I feel they've done a fantastic job so far with American Gods. But as it is only halfway through its run, it's a little early to crown it.

Black Sails is a distant runner up. I don't feel like it had the legs.  The final season was a slog, as the writing and performances just couldn't hold up under the demands of a more serious story. Ray Stevenson's screen presence and charm was entirely wasted as Blackbeard, to the point of him almost being a nonentity as the show meandered about with painfully uninteresting side plots and manufactured romances. The giddy excitement of seeing the promotional images of Stevenson as Blackbeard were entirely destroyed by how clumsily he was used. But he's not the only one. The show never manages to establish any good European antagonists once the pirates stop fighting one another. The show even abandons most of what made the first two seasons watchable and fun: the treasure hunting and sex. Watch Seasons 1 & 2, then stop.  If you're curious to see how it ends, watch *Muppet Treasure Island*.

Spartacus was good in its first season, and its prequel season, as shameless bits of excess and fun. But it's basically HBO's *Rome* with a lobotomy and an erection. The show hits a downward spiral once the gladiators are on the loose, and the show's glaring weaknesses are exposed over and over, mostly being dialog (everyone talks like a flustered, angry Yoda as the show has the actors speaking English dialog in a clumsy attempt at reproducing Latin syntax) and characters (they're mostly stupid, or unlikable, or both). The final nail in the coffin is the way the series spoiled its own decent chance at a three dimensional antagonist in Crassus.  Didn't help that the action scenes were repetitive and boring after a while, the Romans so comically inept that it became difficult to take them seriously as enemies, and the show seriously... period. At least, unlike Black Sails, they didn't abandon their cornerstones of sex and violence in the final seasons.  Watch *Blood & Sand* and *Gods of the Arena*, then skip to the last two or three episodes of the final season. It's a bonus because if you skip all the terrible slogging in the middle, you'll still care about the characters when they all die, and the battle scenes won't feel like you've seen them a dozen times already. 

The White Queen is a sad reduction of one of history's most captivating civil wars (The Wars of the Roses), distilling the story down to a flimsy soap opera, and, most unforgivably, stepping into that world (1461) *after* most of the time period's most intriguing characters have already been killed and/or driven into exile. The White Queen even chose the wrong queen to focus on, reducing the fascinating Margaret of Anjou to a Discount Cersei Lannister. I blame most of TWQ's faults on the BBC though, since this was their baby (choosing to adapt Phillipa Gregory's historical bodice rippers instead of a broader scope source material) and Starz really only said ""Add some tits for our version!"" and bought in for US distribution rights. There's really no way to make TWQ watchable. Hopefully at some point, the Wars of the Roses gets the television adaptation it deserves. "
Princess Hours,I just came here to make sure Spartacus was #1. You may live.
Princess Hours,Nice post but I still think they still yet to produce their signature show closest is the legendary show Spartacus.
Princess Hours,"Nice to see Spartacus at #1, I do think Black Sails is a tad overrated but it is far, far better than #8"
Princess Hours,"*  ash vs evil dead
*  blacksails 
*  spartacus

american gods, im not sure yet.

"
Princess Hours,Are we having fun yet?
Princess Hours,"Season 1 of Boss was a masterpiece! Kelsey Grammer even won a Golden Globe for his role. Season 2 wasn't as spectacular, but still watchable. "
Princess Hours,"I think Starz is gradually catching up with Cinemax when it comes to show quality.

Magic City was a good, and good looking show. Come to think of it. I miss it.

The Girlfriend Experience, I thought, was quietly gripping. That story was told in such a intense way that it stayed with me for days after I binged watched it. I can't wait for the new season

The first season of Spartacus was unlike anything I've ever seen. So sexy. So violent. It was amazing.

Flesh and Bone never held my attention. I tried to watch the entire season, but couldn't. The acting was great. I was pulled in by the story taking place in the ballet world. But, in the end, the episodes moved way too slow.

I have a love/hate relationship with Power. I keep watching because I'm curious to see what happens with these characters, but yet there's a certain something missing with this show. It doesn't feel high quality to me.

Thank you for this post. I hadn't really thought about, nor fully appreciated, the hidden gems that have come from Starz.
"
Princess Hours,How the hell did you forget to mention Boss? It was short lived but for a political series it was on another level than House Of Cards.
Princess Hours,American Gods deserves to be up there 
Princess Hours,American Gods is prob my favorite show on tv right now
Princess Hours,Gratitude for putting Spartacus #1....
Princess Hours,"Great write-up. I'm currently going through Black Sails and just started season 2, really liking it so far. I have to admit that I'm completely obsessed with Outlander though. That show is probably my favorite on tv, besides GoT. I love how it follows the books very closely. I'm also really enjoying The White Princess, though I don't like how it actually skips the War of the Roses. I'm also sad that it'll end before Henry the 8th becomes king, but I guess I'll just have to rewatch The Tudors for that piece of history."
Princess Hours,Magic City was an amazing show with amazing talent.  Glad to see it got some love.  Spartacus was great.  Deserves to be number one.
Princess Hours,"Starz has some great shows but, since they lost their contract with Disney for movies, their movie selection has been shit and the Lionsgate deal does not seem to have improved the situation. I'm really only keeping the channel for ""American Gods"" and ""Outlander""."
Princess Hours,"Magic City was fuckin awesome.  Still boggles my mind why the hell they cancelled it, makes no damn sensr"
Princess Hours,"Kinda ironic you wrote this, I remember reading this a few weeks ago! "
Princess Hours,Surprised you didn't mention Torchwood:Miracle Day at all.
Princess Hours,"Surprised you didn't mention Olga Kurylenko; she looked absolutely stunning in Magic City. I really liked the first season, but season 2 focused more on the parts that I didn't really care for, so I'd probably put it a bit lower and Black Sails higher. "
Princess Hours,Thanks for putting this together! I've only watched Ash vs. Evil Dead and American Gods and I've been meaning to get into Flesh & Bones and recently I've been wondering what else the network has to offer. When I need a new show to watch I'll look back at this list and pick one up!
Princess Hours,I'm surprised that none of y'all mentioned Da Vinci's Demons. It was an impressive show
Princess Hours,"I'd like to see you do one for HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax as well"
Princess Hours,"Wish more people watched this, at least the first season. It was kind of ""bad"" and hard to get through the first episode but I'm so glad I stuck through that episode. First season was one of the most satisfying contained seasons I've seen."
Princess Hours,"I loved it also, to me John Hannah and the political stories and backstabbing is what really made it special. Even on the very low budget the first season had (13 million for the first season IIRC), which was almost the same amount as a single episode of Rome the people were comparing it to at the time. 
While the differences were obvious with most of Spartacus being shot on a sound stage and rome building massive sets, it was the engrossing story that kept us coming back.

[Jupiter's Cock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5MS7MCHRjM)"
Princess Hours,I would love a Spartacus style Genghis Khan show.
Princess Hours,Black Sails is #2 behind Spartacus for me.
Princess Hours,"It would seem that for some, sex and nudity are more important to telling a good story than an actual good story."
Princess Hours,"I've only seen through season 2 (spoilers up to that point to follow)    
...    
but the things it does wrong is a great reverse example of why game of thrones is so good. [spoiler](#s ""because people generally don't die, the danger is less exciting.  But even more importantly, the plots start getting twisted and incestuous.  Sometimes people seem to align for no other reason beyond ""well, without permanent consequences, there are so many different ways to align the same group of characters, and this combination is next"" "")    
     
Additionally, I don't know if it's for budget reasons or what, but at times the pacing is quite slow."
Princess Hours,"Every aspect of Spartacus felt uniquely fitting to its identity. I don't think any other show has felt as defined before. The special effects that started out criticized as low-quality eventually evolved into its own iconic style. You could post any frame of it and recognize it.

Likewise, as you mentioned, every line of dialog would be equally recognizable. The only other show I can think of with such distinct dialog is ""Justified."""
Princess Hours,"I thought Megan Mullaly was a more than adequate replacement, and almost liked her character more. Doing a season without Adam Scott as Henry would have been pointless and infuriating though. Unless they somehow got Paul Rudd in the cast like originally planned (he was supposed to be Henry) "
Princess Hours,I thought it was already cancelled for quite awhile before Adam Scott even joined Parks and Rec...
Princess Hours,"Black Sails is great, just know that the first season is fairly slow until the back half of the episodes. After season one is where it really gets going though."
Princess Hours,you're welcome. I actually wrote this 2 weeks before American Gods premiered. It'd definitely be at least top 5 on this list the show has been fantastic so far and if it continues down this path might be the next hit series for starz. 
Princess Hours,I love a lot f the other shows but I'm about to tap out on American Gods. Taking one of the least interesting and most unlikable minor characters and stretching her into the second lead was a terrible idea.
Princess Hours,"To be fair, it would have been impossible to top Children of Earth. Still...Miracle Day. Yikes."
Princess Hours,"Agreed, but even without the caveats. It's just a good show. *Survivor's Remorse* should definitely be on this list."
Princess Hours,how would u do it? 
Princess Hours,"He is right about Spartacus at number one, but the rest would just appear completely randomly ordered."
Princess Hours,I thought Pillars of the Earth was awful and a poor adaptation of the book. It felt rushed and was nothing like I'd imagine it when I originally read. 
Princess Hours,"World Without End had completely different actors, actually."
Princess Hours,"Yeah, I don't see how black sails can draw people in within a couple episodes. Usually people start liking it at the end of season 1 or definitely the beginning of s2. But, it's definitely worth it since s1 doesn't have that many episodes."
Princess Hours,Spartacus is a far more intelligent show than Rome. 
Princess Hours,"Yes, but it does look like American Gods is preparing to step into that role."
Princess Hours,"> I think Starz is gradually catching up with Cinemax when it comes to show quality.

Honestly, I think they're past Showtime at this point. They probably have the second-most subscriptions behind HBO so I guess it shouldn't be all that surprising, should one agree."
Princess Hours,"on tvserieshub blog site? yea, I wrote it. "
Princess Hours,How is that ironic?
Princess Hours,"That wouldn't be on the ""best of"" list though... "
Princess Hours,With showtime they would all just be #5.
Princess Hours,"Spartacus is easily one of the best TV shows I've ever seen, even with the comically over done splashing blood. They nail two things so, so right - the characters and the fights. And both of those elevate that series into the greats. "
Princess Hours,"Episode 4 of the first season is probably the best example of ""WTF?! Did this show just get GOOD?"" that I've ever seen.

I had been rinsing it out to everyone I knew for months, but I'd always read about ""Just stick with it until eps 4 or 5 and you'll be in"".

And yeah, that was how it was."
Princess Hours,Then Pits is where the series took a turn for the better.
Princess Hours,"Watch the film Mongol, it's brilliant although not as over the top as Spartacus."
Princess Hours,Netflix's Marcopolo is essentially that. I think the ruler in that is Genghis's grandson.
Princess Hours,but Black Sails has sex/nudity AND a good story
Princess Hours,No idea what show you watched but the only safe character were Billy Biceps and Silver really. Almost everyone else was fair game and plenty of them actually died.
Princess Hours,"You've inadvertently explained why Game of Thrones is soapy fluff: Literally all it is is the pornography of ""event"" television popularised by and now cut'n'pasted into this 'prestige' series.

The writers had no idea where their story was going from the beginning, and so they've come out with a product that is gigantic portions of raw plot table-setting for events that may or may never come, a drizzling of tits and most importantly, a big ultra-violence set piece every 4 or 5 episodes to keep the plot ticking along - exactly like soaps do every season. Characters never have any real arcs because they're either always killed before they can be resolved (or more likely because killing the character is the only way they could be resolved - just like in soaps). The next helping of plot is then created by having other characters react to that violence - and so it continues, forever. And the sparseness of the setting means that groups of characters are isolated in bubbles in disparate locations across the map to pursue their individual stories (just like in soaps).

Black Sails by contrast is an exemplar of tightness and focus. The writers knew exactly where the story would end up from episode one - so the pacing throughout is deliberate and serves the needs of the story, not the titillation of the audience always hunting for the next cool death or awesome explosion. The story itself is as much the tale of one community as it is the personal arcs of the characters, so the fact that no one character's actions can happen without consequences for every other character is something that is very real in each episode (where it is very abstract and uncertain in GoT). Thus conflict is born in a natural and organic way, from character's beliefs and their consequent actions - and not from fantastical external causes like ice zombies or ill-defined and childish desires to be the king for the sake of being powerful.

Game of Thrones should be cautionary tale for any writer: A great writer knows how to put his characters through the wringer and bring them out the other side; changed, but alive. A great writer writes because they have a point to make, not because they enjoy genre tropes and thought ""I could do something with that"". And great stories end. That's how you know they're a story. Now I can give GoT the benefit of the doubt with this one, but the source material doesn't really give a good impression. If George Martin knew what he was doing, it would be three books, not six and counting."
Princess Hours,"> The only other show I can think of with such distinct dialog is ""Justified.""

Deadwood.  And Firefly.  I love how all of those shows use language in such creative ways."
Princess Hours,"The first half of season 3 is also very slow, but still worth sailing through."
Princess Hours,black sails as 8th is simply absurd
Princess Hours,lolno
Princess Hours,It might but it will take a while to find its footing.
Princess Hours,That's cool!
Princess Hours,"Good point but the poster seemed interested in talking about successful and failed shows, Torchwood just has an interesting background for Starz."
Princess Hours,"I love Spartacus. My all time fave of favorite shows.

i honestly would love another Roman epic shot in a similar vein.

Also it should star Lucy Lawless and Jon Hannah again, lewd, rude and shrewd.

I'd like to see Starz take on I Claidius or the end of the republic and rise of the Empire.

Theres so much potential."
Kiss Me,Maybe picky comment but I think the show was done by Channel 4 (uk) and only distributed by Netflix elsewhere.
Kiss Me,"Also interesting is that after looking up the source materiel, the two have like nothing in common. They made up the entire gaming angle up from scratch, and just kinda referenced the origional plot in a few sections.

Apparently, the book is just about euthenasia and online vs. real personas and the ethics of that, whilst the show is like... well not that. Also Tess is like a middle aged women in the book that you never see, rather than a hot damsel in distress narrative device."
Kiss Me,"It was done by a third party production company. Channel 4 has UK and Ireland rights and Netflix has rights everywhere else, but it's another company that actually makes it anyway."
Kiss Me,"It's a co-production between Channel 4 and Netflix.
> Kiss Me First, a co-production with Channel 4 in the U.K., may be the Black Mirror-iest of Netflix's Black Mirror-adjacent programs [...]

Kiss Me,[deleted]
Kiss Me,"Yeah, I couldn't even bring myself to watch the last episode - I thought there was gonna be some kind of big reveal that explained everything, but honestly, why the main character is even risking their lives for Tess when it was kinda shown earlier that she liked the idea of her more than the actual person is kinda silly."
Kiss Me,[deleted]
Kiss Me,This would have been really great if they aren't going the emo/thriller route 
Kiss Me,Trailer looks awesome...it’s like a mash up of tron + ready player one !! 
Kiss Me,Awesome. Another Netflix show....yay
Kiss Me,"I found the main characters so annoying that I started sympathising with the antagonist. The concept is cool, but there is an issue with pacing especially between episodes. And there are also annoying leaps in logic within the plot."
Kiss Me,Good concept ... meh execution.
Kiss Me,Probably not gonna see a lot of discussion about it because so far it's only been shown in the UK. It won't get released in the US until the 29th.
Kiss Me,"Yeah, that would explain it. Doh. Oh well, I'll wait then :-). Y'all should watch it, it's really interesting."
Kiss Me,"Oh yeah, I plan on it. It's already on my netflix watch list."
Kiss Me,"The writing is as bad as it ever got on the worst episodes of Skins and the characters are terrible. There is little to no motivation to any of their actions, the plot is dragged on by important conversations being randomly interrupted, there is enough angst there to fuel the entire CW lineup for years, everyone is an idiot most of the time, unless the plot demands otherwise (and it almost never does). 

But hey, the lead character becomes a cool hacker out of nowhere, despite having no prior coding experience or any skills whatsoever (she is mopping floors and waiting tables for a living).

If that's not enough to make you cringe, someone commits suicide early in the season by stepping off the roof of like a 20-floors high apartment block. His slightly bruised body is shown shortly afterwards (no damage to the face ofc). 

There is a character who comes all the way to the UK from the US to assassinate someone who the show's antagonist had invited to hang out with them in a secluded area inside of a computer game where they don't really do anything noteworthy, but somehow the place is special and she is ruining it. 

There is little explanation to what those people actually find in the game (or inside the secluded area within). They are never particularly happy either inside or outside of it. Inside the game they are being manipulated and mostly just sit around and discuss boring shit until they start logging off. It feels as if 13 Reasons Why had been a VR experience.

Concepts of time, choice and money are completely foreign to the series. Characters travel all over the world because the guy in that computer game they like for some unknown reason had told them so. There are only so many plot holes you can fill with sex, drugs and loud music."
Kiss Me,Simple answer: no. 
Kiss Me,I have watched the first episode... and it's not for me. Too much cheap-ish pseudo-videogame CGI. If they cut down on that in further epsides it might become better... but I'm not going to find out myself. 
Kiss Me,I'm episodes in and it's pretty dull overall. The drama is building slowly.

Kiss Me,"These are all comedies that have a history of outlandish moments and stories. I don't think anyone should be looking at these shows for ""good messages"" and if they are, they're the ones who are at fault. Majority of conedies throughout history have fucked up shit, but they're not supposed to be taken seriously.

&nbsp;

Finding these ""bad messages"" in more grounded dramas would be a better talking point for you imo. Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay."

Kiss Me,I liked how the author cited the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights in a complaint about iCarly
Kiss Me,"> Shows like Gilmore Girls have come under scrutiny in recent years for some of the character's actions that were previously deemed okay.

I think this is more a judgment on certain members of the audience than it is the show. In Gilmore Girls, all of the various characters make errors but they still remain protagonists. Nor does the show flinch from showing the negative consequences of their actions.

So when you hear people who are re-evaluating the characters, they're not really making statements about the show so much as their own failure to understand it on first viewing. Even worse, they're re-evaluating on the naive and simplistic premise that good people can't also be flawed people."
Kiss Me,"Having messed up messages is more problematic when the subject matter at hand is  family/kids shows since kids will actually take the messages to heart many times. While messed up messages in adult programming is still bad because it's meant to be taken more seriously and should have more complex stories and messages, I don't think it's as much of an issue there because adults typically don't carry as many messages from shows as kids do, and they can usually use their own logic to identify when a message is bad and why it is bad. 

Many of these examples are from kids/family shows so I think they're reasonable arguments to be made."
Kiss Me,People constantly talked about how Lily is literally the worst and Marshall deserves better when it was airing.

Kiss Me,here's a [good read on Total Drama Island](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/uptttz/animation_the_tragedy_of_total_drama_reunion_how/) from the r/HobbyDrama subreddit
Kiss Me,This was a great read.
Kiss Me,"That was quite the word vomit, and I remember Teletoon fondly as a kid watching it on weekends during sleepovers at friends places. How are you going to write all that and not mention some greats like:

-	Roughnecks (Animated Starship Troopers)
-	The Oblongs
-	Undergrads
-	Mission Hill
-	The Critic
-	Tripping the Rift

And some weirder ones like Home Movies, Quads!, and god knows what else I can’t quite remember. I do recall Cybersix being a little over my head as a kid though and thought the main character was actually a dude for awhile lol.

Edit - I also rewatched the entirety of Roughnecks recently and it actually holds up pretty damn well. The voice acting is done well, and even though the CGI is from that era, it was really well done. I had never seen it all the way through when I was younger due to missing episodes and their infamously bad release schedule, but it was well worth the time to watch. The last season got cut short and it could have ended more cleanly, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly even after all these years."
Kiss Me,"I was there for the silver age. 

I really liked Delilah and Julius. 

And one I didn't see mentioned later on was Detentionaire. Came in 2011-2015 and was pretty good."
Kiss Me,"I remember watching Undergrads and Clone high on Teletoon, you mentioned so many shows I totally forgot about....What a loss, but it was time."
Kiss Me,Teletoon was such a big part of my childhood. I used to watch scooby doo every day after school.
Kiss Me,Neds newt was the shit. You missed Dragon Ball
Kiss Me,"Omg I forgot about Megababies. The theme song immediately started playing in my head. I LOVED Braceface and For Better Or For Worse! Ugh I grew up on Teletoon, from the mid/late nineties till about 2004. This post was so nostalgic."
Kiss Me,"This post was a huge nostalgia trip for myself. Just thinking back there are so many shows that I enjoyed that actually were Teletoon originals and I just didn't realize it - it's kind of amazing! Teletoon circa 2005 through 2009 was my favourite period, mostly because of all the cool action-adventure shows that premiered in that time. I loved watching Chaotic, Bakugan, Spider Riders, Atomic Betty, and Skyland. I did also enjoy 6teen, the first season of Total Drama Island, and Johnny Test, but I never watched them consistently. From their earlier blocks, I will always have a soft spot for The Tofus, What About Mimi, What's with Andy (though admittedly I mostly watched the Romanian dub for this), Rescue Heroes, Maggie and the Ferocious Beast, The Kids from Room 402 (mostly the Romanian dub again)...and the theme song from Flying Rhino Junior High will still occasionally get stuck in my head :P 

I just hope that all these shows will be made more accessible for more folks to enjoy in future and not get put into an inconspicuous vault/removed from streaming without warning."
Kiss Me,I just bought the entire Redwall book series. 20+ books. Hoping it gets another shot at the screen because it's prime for adaptation imo
Kiss Me,"I grew up in Quebec and teletoon was my childhood. I remember it had the best animated series out there even before series that had continuity(not episodic) was a thing. Redwall, silvering and toad patrol were amazing."
Kiss Me,"My parents didnt want to get more than the basic tv package, we didnt have the Teletoon channels, much to my chagrin.

Channel 44 for us, I think that was the french version.

We had to make do with VrakTv (25) and YTV (70?)."
Kiss Me,Anyone remember Untalkative Bunny? That's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of Teletoon
Kiss Me,"Man I thought I was the only one who remembered Mega Babies.

Also shout out to weeknights from 8-9pm when The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show was on."
Kiss Me,Delta state was the shit!
Kiss Me,"Don't forget Clone High! The late night era with Undergrads, Oblongs, Mission hill and Clone High was the best."
Kiss Me,Dragon Ball was on YTV
Kiss Me,I knew I was forgetting one. Clone High was amazing.
Kiss Me,It was on both actually
Kiss Me,I seem to remember Sons of Butcher playing in that era with those shows but that might’ve been YTV
Kiss Me,"Ah, I see now. They aired 13 episodes in 1997. So yeah you're *technically* correct, but I think most Canadian kids who grew up in that era would remember it as a YTV show."
Kiss Me,Saw that too and I swear they had more than 14 episodes. It was a long time ago so who knows
Kiss Me,"LOST. That show was the king of cliffhangers, and to this day still has the most memorable cliffhangers out of any show I've seen. There's even a [wiki page](https://lostpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Cliffhanger) that lists out all the cliffhangers."

Kiss Me,Lost was basically the king of cliffhangers. They were ending each episode with such crazy cliffhangers - it was like a cocaine addiction. Prison break 1st season was similar.
Kiss Me,"""We have to go back, Kate!"""
Kiss Me,"Kate, we have to go back!!! 

Not Penny’s Boat!!

LOST was great in those early seasons."
Kiss Me,"Nearly every season of LOST

Alia’s also had some amazing cliffhangers that were torture.

Those were only for a summer though."
Kiss Me,"The biggest one I remember was Star Trek TNG's Best of Both Worlds cliffhanger. It's unfortunate that the immediate resolution to the cliffhanger suuuuuucked (Oops, didn't work! 🙄), even if the rest of part 2 was great."
Kiss Me,Still thinking about that Severance finale tbh
Kiss Me,"The Office between season 2 and 3 is a good one. 

I will add Westworld between seasons 1 and 2."
Kiss Me,Surprised no one has said The Walking Dead.  That cliffhanger felt like it had the entire nation by the balls for the off season
Kiss Me,"I think all the Lost seasons ended with massive cliffhangers of the sort you described, though I think the season 1 finale was the most ""why you leave me hangin'?"" of them all.  

Battlestar Galactica - Season 3 finale - quite a lot there but the very end was just such a real ""WTF just happened?"" moment."
Kiss Me,"Most recently the final season of Better Call Saul being split up. ""Okay, let's talk."""
Kiss Me,"The reboot show ""V"" by ABC ended on a cliff hanger because there was supposed to be a next season, but there wasn't.

(Spoilers, if you care) the show ended with multiple main characters being killed and the likely destruction of humanity. It was an unintentionally very depressing ending."
Kiss Me,">Historically, Who Shot J.R.? On Dallas was huge, but that was before my time but I’ve always heard that was an absolutely, monumentally, humongous, can’t-miss event for the reveal.

""A Democrat shot Jr.""

>This probably doesn’t come anywhere close to Dallas

we'll never see that again because there are too many other things on TV now, and if you miss the premiere.. so what - everything is on demand. Dallas was ""one of three programs"" on television between 9 and 10 or whatever and if you missed it, you MISSED IT until they rebroadcast..  in those days, if you were a fan of a show, you stuck with it because there's no way to get caught up in the shows on other channels.

&#x200B;

I was too young to even CARE about Dallas but i remember the hype.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday\_night\_death\_slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_night_death_slot)

The term possibly began as a reflection of certain programs' dominance of Friday night in the 1980s and 1990s, which resulted in decreased ratings for those scheduled opposite their competitors.\[1\]\[2\]\[3\] By the 2000s, it was used in reference to the belief that young, single Americans rarely watch television on Friday or Saturday nights, thereby removing from the household what is considered the most lucrative demographic for advertisers.\[4\]\[5\] **With the collapse of the traditional network viewing model where viewers had to be in front of the TV to watch shows (and then the evolution from VCR or DVR capabilities to almost all shows being viewed increasingly through on-demand streaming media), the stigma of Friday night scheduling is much less evident or considered today than in the past.**"

Kiss Me,Season 3 of Barry
Kiss Me,"Farscape had amazing cliffhangers. Season two was so good, that when it got cancelled in my country on free TV, I learned the new season was available in Paytv. So I got myself Paytv, which wasn't cheap.

After season three and another killer cliffhanger it was cancelled entirely in my country. So no more dubbed versions. Season four was my starting point of watching shows in English.

Season 4 had again a cliffhanger that left me screaming. First because we already knew that the series was cancelled and two the cliffhanger it self. And a year later we got the mini series. I was very lucky 😃."
Kiss Me,It's been 6 months and I still can't stop thinking about the Severance season finale.

I'm still waiting for the next one. Hopefully, they'll do it sooner or later."
Kiss Me,"One of the recent Chicago Fire seasons ended with the rescue squad guys trapped under a capsized boat in Lake Michigan and their tanks were running out I think. The final shot of the season was like the ambulance medics standing on the pier watching for someone to surface and nothing out there.

Then when the new season came back they got out of danger in like 30 seconds and it really wasn't a problem at all and that annoyed me."
Kiss Me,Prison Break season 2 when Michael enters Sona prison

Kiss Me,"The end of S2 of Dark with the revelation that the scope of the show would be expanding due to ""technological advances"" left me running through all the possibilities for the next year waiting for S3 to come out. It was a perfect cliffhanger that left you wanting to know what happened next.  I almost feel bad for people who can just binge the whole series now without having to wait all that time between seasons."
Kiss Me,Sherlock series 2  bbc   24 season 5 psych season 5
Kiss Me,The Vampire Diaries had such solid writing the first 3 or 4 seasons that each cliffhanger kept me on my toes all summer long.

David Schwimmer wouldn't be able to play a convincing Somalian. He might, however, be a passable sommelier."
Secret Garden,"I don't know if you wrote about this because that's too much reading for me right now, but do you remember that flashback scene of Schwimmer's wife being hit by the car? I have no fucking idea what was going through their head when they did that scene because its supposed to be sad, but it was just flat out hilarious.

There was also another scene where the Schwimmer's son almost gets hit by a car and he literally just sits down right in the same spot and starts drawing his dead mom. 

This show was fucking stupid."
Secret Garden,I appreciate your review in lieu of viewing a show that I was passively curious about. Funny and fairly succinct.
Secret Garden,">Dion is also in good with his public defender, Marissa **(played by E.E. Cummings)**. You can tell by the way he's fucking her on a table two minutes into the Pilot episode.

To be fair, E.E. Cummings is [pretty dreamy.](http://www.litkicks.com/sites/default/files/eecummings.jpg)"
Secret Garden,It wasn't bad it just tried to do too much.  Every character had some sort of lie they were telling someone else.  Half the characters were doing illegal shit. Its like people don't understand that Breaking Bad didn't start at the fifth season.  You have to build up to that shit.  I honestly have the same issue with Ozark. 
Secret Garden,Has no one else noticed this was written by Vargas?

Secret Garden,"Worst Show I ever watched to Completion: WEEDS. I watched all 6 or 8 seasons and i started hating it after season 1. I mean i didn't love season 1 but the hate was real after Season 1 and every twist and turn just made me angrier. It's one of the worst shows I've ever watched much less to completion.

I think the only reason I watched it was an NPR Fresh Air interview about the Banana thing it sounded interesting and it kinda was but           it hoenstly wasn't worth season after season of DerpFace McGee. It made me hate R.E.D. 2 Because i couldn't see the female lead as anything other than nancy botwin."

Secret Garden,"Don't be sad about not knowing about wine.  Nobody knows everything.  You don't need to be a douche to enjoy wine (yes, statistics seem to disprove this theory though!) but for a bit of a look at how complicated wine can be but in a really entertaining way check out Somm on Netflix.  About four people trying to achieve Grand Sommelier status.  I enjoy wine, know what I enjoy, try to keep the douchiness to a minimum, don't do tastings, etc. and found this doco fascinating.  The knowledge these guys needed was phenomenal, but they are the Michael Jordans of wine."

Secret Garden,"Been on MTV (interviewed on the street in NYC, said something funny they used and long lost friend got in touch). Same thing happened with local (L.A.) news at a restaurant opening. Both times, for months later I had people mention it. 

For awhile a lifetime ago, I did extra work and was on a couple dozen TV shows and a few movies (***Last Action Hero, In The Line of Fire***).

A rather bizarre/macabre story is from the week long night shoot on ***Last Action Hero*** in Culver City at the ""Munchkin Hotel"" where the opening scene of the film within a film was shot. They had all these fake police cars in the street with their emergency lights going. 

Suddenly there was this commotion when a car arrived and soon *actual* police & an ambulance arrived. Later that night the sad story trickled down to us: three guys had gone to do a drug deal, it went bad and one got shot in the stomach. His buddies were trying to find an ER to take him to, saw all the police emergency lights and hoped the ""police"" could save their friend. He died and there was an ER close by they might have gotten him to in time had they not stopped at the set. 

Incidentally, this was one of two times I was near the aftermath of a bad drug deal. Another time on a nearby freeway I saw two guys jump out of car on an on ramp and run away. I circled back to find another would be Samaritan and a CHP officer. Seems the guy in the back seat shot the driver and then he & the passenger ran off. Cop seemed to think the driver would live. "

Every last one of them were extremely friendly and professional.  Once the realised I did night audit and then drove them around all day they loaded me up with swag. Very tired but fantastic week.  Best part was actually chatting to one of the producers and discussing why FF was better than Comedy Company.  Some very good reasons I thought.

Secret Garden,"a little less than ten years ago, i was a PA on a show called ""clean house"" i think it was on the style network.  my cousin was a producer and she managed to get me the job.  it was kind of a home remodeling show, where they visit someone's incredibly messy house and basically clean it out and remodel at least one room.  but i worked on the special 2hr episode where they cleaned out and rennovated an entire house.  a house that had one their contest of ""messiest house in america"". the house was fucking awful and as a PA, they gave us all this shittiest jobs.  

anyway, one day a grip and one of the camera guys were just fucking around with the camera with behind the scenes stuff.  they did interviews of all the PA's when we were all on break just sitting around.  i managed to say something funny, something about how if you get lost in this town, you can always follow the smell back to the house.  the scene ended up on some compilation episode, like a special ""behind the scenes"" episode or something.  my cousin told me when it aired and i watched my big 5 second on-screen debut with a few friends when we were hanging out that night.

Secret Garden,"Jose Luis Sin Censura, a local show here in L.A. that was a Jerry Springer in Spanish. I was one of the people in the crowd selected to fight. The whole show, as you might imagine, is staged. All the guests of the show, for the most part, do not know each other. And the people in the crowd that ask questions and fight, are pre-selected before the show. 

MTV's Burned. It was only on for a summer. Premise of the show was to expose fake players or wannabe ladies men. We had an acquaintance that was perfect for the show. The casting company felt the same way and booked us for the show. He had no clue what was happening. He was just told by my brother that they were going to a party in Hollywood. My buddies and I drove to the offices of the production company and they drove us to the house where the party was to avoid him noticing our car.

The party is packed and the ratio is like 90/10 in favor of the women. Anyone in their right mind would've assumed it was a set up. They sit us in a bed room, give us headphones and we all watch and listen on the little monitors. He shows up with my brother and our job was to point out all his lies. The producer told me that after 15 minutes they had enough material to make multiple shows and could stop filming. He laughed because he said he's never seen someone lie that much. They film for about another 20 minutes. One of the girls he was talking to takes him inside the house and stands in front of the TV. The video they just recorded starts playing of all his lies. She confronts him about lies and whether he'll change. He's in-different. We come out and have a big laugh (though he wasn't happy at all). They have all of us do those interview confessional deals you see on reality shows. They make you do multiple takes until you show the emotions they want. Show aired a few months later. We no longer talk to him."
Secret Garden,"oddly enough I was on Dr harry back in the day, and he too crushed my dreams, by telling me my cat was pregnant, then telling me off camera to have it desexed and basically kitty abortion, when all was said and done cat wasn't even pregnant. "
Secret Garden,"Was walking along campus when I was asked to do an interview about my experience with AIDS education for the local news. It was only a small thing for a small city, but they used my overall opinion as the voice over for the wrap up at the end of the segment, which was cool. I was worried I'd look / sound bad on TV, but I did great! "
Secret Garden,I've been on 9 News Perth a couple of times 
Secret Garden,Was interviewed a few times as a kid.  My mother was an peace activist and I used to go to protests all the time.  It's not as exciting as you'd think to see yourself on the TV.
Secret Garden,[deleted]
Secret Garden,I may have been. I remember being filmed at school for some news segment or something. Never got to see it so I have no idea if I got on or not.
Secret Garden,"I used to work at a PBS station that did a yearly televised auction to supplement it's operating budget.  My boss told me that he needed a model for the green and pink wedding dress that had been donated from a designer store.  The main material of the dress was that sort of duo tone stuff this is white from one angle, but pink from another or when light hits it strongly.  The lace was light green.  So was the detailing that was all over it ... I don't know what it's called but imagine light green silly string in looping patterns.  I was then told that I would be fired unless I wore it.  The dress was too small for me by a good bit and I was sort of strapped into it.  Whoever bought it was likely got a bit of a shock when they picked it up and saw how tiny it was.  



I left that job not long after.  "
Secret Garden,"Was interviewed by a national tv station as part of their program which focused on schools because a friend and I had won the regional leg of a national quiz competition. Was 16 at the time, 26 now. "
Secret Garden,"I was on s2e1 of the listener. There is a chess scene at the start of the ep. In the scene you will see a guy taking bets and my line was ""I'll take that bet"" then I was to hand the cash over to the bookie. Problem was they had to do like 5 takes and i could only stay for 2 of them so i ended up getting replaced but after ""the listener"" wins all the chess games you can see me right in the front of the background. 

But one of my friends was actually in 2 pretty big ads

one for ANZ apple pay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0OS6WVe0xw

and the other for AMF bowling https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyB7NMhpqec"
Secret Garden,I was on an episode of Zoom when I was like 12. 
Secret Garden,I saw a taping of John Stossel's show when he came to my school. The back of my head has been on Fox News. 
Secret Garden,I've been in a couple of commercials and an episode of The Beast with Patrick Swayze.  He was really chill dude.  I also just booked a small one-liner role on a major network show.  Pretty cool stuff.
Secret Garden,"I mean, if you count public access, I wrote and showed up in some shitty TV show my friend and I made in high school.  
  
If you don't, then I've been in the background of a hockey game once. I look pretty excited to be there, which is good because I usually don't look excited (even if I am)."
Secret Garden,I was on a show on Animal Planet about veterinarian emergency rooms.  My dachshund shared the show with a turtle when it aired.  It was actually pretty cool.  
Secret Garden,My dad hosted a horror show back in the mid 70's.  I was on that show one time.  I blew the steam away from him as it came out of a cauldron.  It was really just dry ice steam.
Secret Garden,"I work in the film/tv production industry in NYC so I have been the background of a few tv shows. The last time I saw my self on TV was about a month ago on the ABC show, People's List for a behind the scenes shoot."
Secret Garden,[deleted]
Secret Garden,"Have a friend from high school who is on the today show fairly often, thats the closest i get lol"
Secret Garden,"Around ten I was on Storybook Squares.  A kids version of Hollywood Squares.  Florence Henderson was Little Bo Peep and Oscar the Grouch was the Center Square.   Standing off stage next to the giant hand they would occasionally throw on stage of The Gong Show.  

Won the game,  only question I got wrong was  ""Do scientists believe that we will eventually be eating the plates that we are currently eating off of today?""
Won a car,  was minor did not ever see car. Won Mike Weed lim ed. Hobie skateboard. Broke my arm skating 15 minutes after getting it in the mail. 

 I've tried searching for a copy of the episode several times but it appears almost every episode except 2 were destroyed for storage issues. On the show date we didn't know anyone who owned  VCR, they had just come out and it was the big one, so not many people had one. "
Secret Garden,"I was an extra on a few Investigation Discovery tv shows, but that's about it."
Secret Garden,I volunteer for golf competitions and they were passing one in the golf channel and they followed one of the players I was with. I look bored as hell when they are playing.
Secret Garden,Does the background of the Today Show count?
Secret Garden,"I was interviewed about Brexit for a Japanese tv station, which was kinda cool (in English, just to clarify)."
Secret Garden,"I was on an episode of Cops. In the background at a protest March, did not get arrested.

Even better was getting my letter on Late Night With David Letterman's viewer mail in 1991. So I wasn't on TV but my handwriting and name were."
Secret Garden,"Everybody's been on the news at least once. I live in Baton Rouge and stuck my head out the window while driving past the news camera in front of the church where the police officers funeral was. But I've been on that news channel three times before. I was at a baseball game another time and because I was 10 and cute, the cameraman filmed me the whole time. You may not be an actor, but there's a chance that you were on tv somehow"
Secret Garden,"Can't say I've been on a regular program, but back when I was still in choir as a teen, we were a part of an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima, which was broadcast live via NHK.  That same summer, a couple of us were also chosen to join an international youth ensemble that performed during a special church service in San Francisco.  The service was part of the UN's 50th Anniversary, and I believe was aired on C-SPAN, along with snippets on the various news shows (and holy crap were there ever a ton of newsies around the cathedral that morning, lol)."
Secret Garden,Also another Australian i used to work at channel nine in their news department so i was on of those people you see sitting behind the news reader. I worked there for about 3 months so i was technically on tv a bit.
Secret Garden,"Twice times I believe, once just was shown on TV at a football game as I was seated a little above the tunnel and was seen as the players came out pretty clearly. Then I can be seen in a interview for Carlton News many years ago as my parents are interviewed about the escalators on the tube stations were broken. I can be seen jumping up and down to get into shot during the interview. I'm essentially a TV star. "
Secret Garden,"I did a voice for Comedy Central's animated sketch show TripTank.








A few weeks before it aired, I was watching South Park, and it went to commercial, so I looked down at my tablet and wasn't paying attention. Suddenly I hear a familiar voice... and I realized that it was my voice in a promo for TripTank. That was an incredible moment for me."
Secret Garden,I threw a rock at Donald Trump's car. Turns out it was being filmed at the time.
Secret Garden,"I have been in the audience (with a speaking role in an episode I can't seem to find at the moment!)  for a CBC talk show that I had spent a couple of years interning for. Attendance was slightly lower during one day of filming, so I was offered to fill in as it's definitely a bit of a neat opportunity! 

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y_CApNIzEs&feature=youtu.be&list=PL9DLSKu7q0q8RqBaBOC4_zi33UIBOzj4y&t=455) a clip from one episode and a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/r2xQz2c.png) from another - don't recall which episode the latter was part of. (I was the one in the dark grey longsleeve)

Thoroughly enjoyed the internship all the way through - learned a lot from everyone there. 
"
Secret Garden,I got on the local news for two seconds when I walked passed a firetruck on career day in elementary school when they were filming.
Secret Garden,I was on an episode of Cops once 
Secret Garden,"I was interviewed by local news once after winning a provincial speedskating meet, but that's it. My sister was an extra on the short lived Falcon Beach, though (if anyone remembers that bit of terribleness in the mid 00's)."
Secret Garden,Twice. Once at a student protest of a teacher being transferred during high school and again after my neighbor had a house fire.
Secret Garden,That was hilarious. How old is this?
Secret Garden,"I love how the ""expert"" totally fell for it."
Secret Garden,"That was really fun. Was everything made up? Even the chewing with her mouth open? Cause that really would drive me crazy. Either way, you guys seem like an amazing couple."
Secret Garden,How did your family and friends take it? 
Secret Garden,"This the prototypical reddit sentence: ""...payed us 1000$"""
Secret Garden,"More info please. I love Jason Bateman, what is this show?"
Secret Garden,Arrested Development?
Secret Garden,Can I have your autograph? 
Secret Garden,"One time a news crew had set up inside a small bookshop when Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows had just come out. I must have been the first person to enter after they had gotten there, because as I was paying they hurriedly started shooting, but I didn't think I'd be able to speak on camera so before they got to ask me anything I started slowly walking away from them raising my eyebrow sternly for whatever reason, perhaps thinking it would dissuade them from wanting to talk to me. The news broadcast still aired me walking away, but thankfully without the weird facial expression."
Secret Garden,what the fuck
Secret Garden,Were the drug deals associated with the increased presence of Hollywood types in the area? Heheh.
Weekly Idol,"Well, there was a reason it was canceled in the first place..."
Weekly Idol,They should just make a battle Royale reality TV show 
Weekly Idol,I thought they cancelled it a few years ago
Weekly Idol,"It's over produced and Katy Perry is a bit silly
"
Weekly Idol,YO DOG
Weekly Idol,"Still can’t believe people watch it after how blatantly fake and overproduced it became.

10 years ago it was already being criticized and outed that a majority of the scenarios were planted and setup intentionally, with 99% of other auditions being filler and 1% luck where you find some horrible comedic relief. 

- friend that was a music performance major went in to sing opera... they wanted her to sing country, then metal, she refused... got 15 seconds to sing her stuff then was dismissed “not what we’re looking for”."
Weekly Idol,"I watched about 12 minutes of the show while at a waiting room. It’s been thoroughly ABC-fied. It’s all feel-good and schmaltzy in a gross, boring Disney way. Not that it was any good before, but at least it had a bit of edge when they showed absolute trainwrecks or when Abdul was loaded and Simon was a butthole to people. "
Weekly Idol,NOBODY WANTS THIS!
Weekly Idol,"Kind of off-topic, but I feel like American Idol meets Nailed It would make for an actually entertaining watch. Get people who can't sing (and acknowledge they can't) and see how far they can make it. "
Weekly Idol,The talent show reality concept is played out. 
Weekly Idol,"That's double what ABC was doing in the timeslot before and on target with what they promised advertisers. So long as it doesn't do much further, it's fine. "
Weekly Idol,"It airs on Sunday night. I catch a few minutes of it after supper, but it's a massive shadow of its previous self. America's Got Talent is the real show."
Weekly Idol,Who asked for this? It certainly had its heyday when it was one of the most influential shows on TV but it’s a relic of a tv era gone by. TV changed so much while it was airing.
Weekly Idol,"from someone who actually knows ratings:

https://twitter.com/TVMoJoe/status/975761632302219265"
Weekly Idol,They need different judges. 
Weekly Idol,I stopped watching it when I heard Katy Perry was going to be a judge. Can't stand her.
Weekly Idol,ITT: In which we learn reddit is not the target audience of American Idol. What a shock.
Weekly Idol,There’s no mean judge 
Weekly Idol,It's just glorified karaoke with forced sob stories. How is this so popular...
Weekly Idol,"Week 1 was people were curious to see the changes this AI series compared to the one with Cowell. Now that we know it's basically the same cliche ""celeb judges unknown individual who can sing good and is talented where America votes on who succeeds when really they don't"" its not worth watching. Especially when we already have plenty of shows like that in America's Got Talent, The Voice, X-Factor, Diddy's new show, Shark tank, etc."
Weekly Idol,[deleted]
Weekly Idol,Wig
Weekly Idol,This show was totally played out years ago.  Now its a corpse.
Weekly Idol,Hmm I actually like it.  I didn't think I'd like Katy Perry but I do and I like Luke Bryan.  I think the singers are better than the voice too.  I guess I'm just different.
Weekly Idol,May it die the painful death it so richly deserves.
Weekly Idol,"I have enjoyed this season more than others I can remember. 

The judges actually care about the people that are up there, and you can see it. They are constantly hugging and handshaking the contestants after their performance. 

They have humanized the judging process. "
Weekly Idol,It's still on??
Weekly Idol,"It's because it sucks. The only saving grace, who seems to have any working knowledge of music,  is Lionel Richie. That's why the other two defer to him. There is SO much good music on The Voice, why would anyone watch that crap? "
Weekly Idol,"I don't want to listen to some woman with the HOA president haircut ""judging"" people.  "
Weekly Idol,Ha
Weekly Idol,3 people stopped watching. We're getting closer. 
Weekly Idol,Good
Weekly Idol,This show is still on? Who's the guy on the right? What the hell happened to Katy Perry?
Weekly Idol,I legitimately didn't know this show was still on air until now.
Weekly Idol,"I haven't watched American Idol in years and flipped it on last night out of curiosity. It was SO bad. The judges have no chemistry, Katy Perry is honestly just the worst and tries way too hard, and most of the contestants were just *mehhh*. "
Weekly Idol,"Lionel Ritchie, Yeah, once you get started
You can't sit down. "
Weekly Idol,They should never have brought this back. There is a reason it was canceled- also no one wants to watch these judges. 
Weekly Idol,Didn't like it anyways. It was fun at first (aka many years ago) but when you can easily recognize the season by looking at judges and video quality you can be sure there is no point in watching same thing over and over again.
Weekly Idol,Haaaa! Good!!! Get this trash off 
Weekly Idol,Right! This shit sucks.
Weekly Idol,This show should be resting in its grave. ABC tried bringing it back probably because they're sinking as a network.
Weekly Idol,End this crap already
Weekly Idol,"considering the opening week they decided a kissing controversy was the way to pump up the show, this doesn't surprise me.

And this week, it was a supposed Taylor Swift dis rivalry...

What will the stupid controversy be next week...

If A.I. has to stoop to this level to try and revive the show, it's going to fail fast, and it appears that it is."
Weekly Idol,"I prefer AI over the Voice and all that dumb fighting. Lionel Ritchie seems super nice, Katy is trying too hard. Hope they have the concerts in the summer. Instead of the Voices winners just disappearing."
Weekly Idol,"I mean at a certain point the average person is like 'wait, i cant even name 3 previous winners..' so  outside people who are just really interested in music/singing your viewers dwindle down."
Weekly Idol,Cause its dog shit
Weekly Idol,"They should've moved on from Seacrest. Minaj and Lovato are perfect examples that current pop stars aren't the best judges so selecting Perry wasn't going to bring in rating unless it was Ariana Grande, she on another level like Swift and Gomez. Cyrus on the Voice is one of the worst judges they had on. "
Weekly Idol,Honestly I forgot about the reboot.
Weekly Idol,I’m not sure why.  This has been the best American Idol has ever been.  They have cut out all the BS auditions that were supposed to be funny or whatever and they have found a diabetic amount of talent.
Weekly Idol,B/c it’s stupid. 
Weekly Idol,What is the number I need to text to vote for this show not to make it to another round?
Weekly Idol,"Yeah.... That's gonna be a no from me, dawg. Sorry."
Weekly Idol,"I think if I died, and there was a hell and I went to it, it would be me strapped to chair with my eyes forced open watching network television between 8pm and 10pm on a weekday or a Sunday.

Holy shit I hate these singing shows so fucking much."
Weekly Idol,Its Katys hair yikes
Weekly Idol,More Katy Perry in Less clothing would help.
Weekly Idol,"Probably doesn't help that they apparently have Perry looking like an even more lesbian-y version of Justin Bieber and wearing the Fifth Element equivalent of a conservative Mom sweater. If she had long hair and tits out, ratings would surely stabilize, perhaps increase marginally. 

Otherwise, it would help not being a stupid fucking show. 

"
Weekly Idol,I watched an episode last week and when they started showing people failing with their own material i turned it off. Its too much like bullying or something. Fuck that show.
Weekly Idol,This show is still on?
Weekly Idol,I can't believe this is still on.
Weekly Idol,I wouldn't be upset if they drop 100%
Weekly Idol,Holy shit. I didn't even know this was still a thing. Man I DO NOT miss cable. 
Weekly Idol,I miss Vote for the Worst. They made it fun to watch.
Weekly Idol,Now judges have to kiss contestants - it’s legit :)
Weekly Idol,It still had good ratings when it went off air. Fox even tried to get it back but ABC outbid them. Even with this drop it still pulled in 8.4 million viewers if it settles around there or dips to 7.8/8 million average it’ll be ABC’s third highest rated show...
Weekly Idol,What a shit show
Weekly Idol,I would definitely apply to be on that. 
Weekly Idol,"I would love that. Closest thing to it now is Alone on the History Channel. There's no fights to the death, but there's alot of bears and bunch of people trying to Outlast each other in the wilderness Battle Royale style."
Weekly Idol,"Or Survivor, but with singing?"
Weekly Idol,Battle royale you say?
Weekly Idol,Liberty City Survivor?
Weekly Idol,It's called twitch.tv
Weekly Idol,"Celebrity Battle Royale, so we can get rid of some C-List has-beens."
Weekly Idol,Popstar edition
Weekly Idol,The last season on Fox was 2016. ABC acquired the rights and launched their run last week.
Weekly Idol,"Yeah so did I but I swear it never went off TV, it's like one of those 'going out of business' stores in NYC.. "
Weekly Idol,They spent so much time on the one dude she kept flirting with 
Weekly Idol,"""\*loud burp*..................................................................I think you're dope."""
Weekly Idol,Her sneaking a kiss on that 18 year old kid was kind of creepy too
Weekly Idol,It's gonna be a no from me dawg
Weekly Idol,"If that was the girl we saw last night, yeah, she really deserved to get cut. Sorry."
Weekly Idol,"You’re comparing OG American Idol to current American Idol. The show became like this in its latter years on Fox, this isn’t ABC-fied. They ramped it up after The Voice got so popular with its positive message. The show ran for 6 years without Simon and 7 without Abdul"
Weekly Idol,"This is why exactly!  I was never a fan of American Idol as a whole, but I used to tune in to the auditions to hear Simon be brutally honest and to hear the William Hung's or the Keith Beukelaer's type disasters.  "
Weekly Idol,"its a different time now you cant have some old white british guy being mean to some minority trans kid with a sob story or you'll get ten billion tweets at how racist you are and then lebron james or someone will post something super brave like ""we all deserve to be happy"" and then huffpost will write an ""article"" about how THINGS. NEED. TO. CHANGE. and then redditors on twoX will repost it and we'll be right back here hth"
Weekly Idol,But schmaltz is delicious
Weekly Idol,A few million people seem to disagree with your inaccurate comment
Weekly Idol,"This isn't true. As a musician, I enjoy seeing these kids pursue their dream. Not everyone is cynical about the show.

Edit: A lot of edgelords out here. Downvote me all you want but I'll still watch AI."
Weekly Idol,A while ago it was announced Simon Cowell was [making a spin-off](http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/the-x-factor/news/a825974/x-factor-terrible-auditions-itv-spin-off-series/) of The X Factor in the UK but instead it will feature bad singers trying to improve.
Weekly Idol,"Sunday AND Monday night. And because of this shit show, Dancing With the Stars is getting a stupid mini-season of just athletes. Most of the athletes on DWTS are so boring - they're mostly all pretty good at dancing but have no personality, so it's not fun to watch. But I'd still prefer a mini-season of only athletes dancing to Zombie Idol. "
Weekly Idol,"
I lost a lot of respect for AGT after that “magician” guy last year made it so far with his performances that were literally just AGT editing shit (like the one where he buried himself). It just felt so idiotic."
Weekly Idol,The voice is huge though so people do still watch these shows
Weekly Idol,They need the original three. 
Weekly Idol,the same way un-glorified karaoke is popular
Weekly Idol,"> still on-brand

They're paying you to *rephrase* the talking points in your own words. *Your own words* asshole."
Weekly Idol,I like the way the judges interact and really like Lionels caring attitude. 
Weekly Idol,You’re also right.
Weekly Idol,"Katy and Luke defer to Lionel because he’s absolutely awesome with decades of success at a level few can attain, let alone maintain. When you look at Katy and Luke’s careers, though, they are not to be taken lightly in any way. Luke has awards and nominations that ANYONE would call a complete career, but he’s only 42 with years ahead to add to it. Katy has impacted both music and culture in just the past 10 years to give her a stature other greats we all know never achieve.

"
Weekly Idol,"My wife started watching the voice and I can tolerate that.  Right away though I told her, ""this is a whole lot more wholesome, don't they have anyone that sucks?""  Then she watched an episode of american idol and I thought I'd get my fill of shitty people being told no and having their dreams crushed.  But these judges are so nice and give everyone the same lies (both positive and negative)."
Weekly Idol,probably because TV has never produced any stars in like 20 seasons or something.  that show wasn't good past the first handful of seasons.
Weekly Idol,"Don't watch for the judges. Watch for the contestants. They're younger, less experienced, and don't disappear right away if theres a tour."
Weekly Idol,Were we watching the same show? I saw some awesome talent performing their own stuff. Don't get all the hate here.
The Promised Neverland,"Hold up, how much has this diverged from the manga because the characters I see in the background don’t show up well into the end of the series."
The Promised Neverland,Why do this to a popular show? Like I didn’t think it was a great adaptation of the series because they cut out all the internal dialogue but this takes the cake for the worst creative decision in recent anime.
The Promised Neverland,Haven't seen such a drop off in quality since One Punch Man.
The Promised Neverland,"Didn't know S2 was out. Really enjoyed the first season. Parts of Raised by Wolves, the HBO series, I thought was very similar to this anime.

Reading some reviews and discussions after watching, I thought it was interesting there was controversy about the Sister Krone character. The way she was drawn and acted."
The Promised Neverland,"They had a single season to wrap up a story that wasn't wrapped up well in the source material. As much as folks are going to complain about the cut material, the reality is that the show would probably have been better served cutting more material and deviating more, not less.

Now if they were willing to go for more seasons, that might be a different story, but it's not like the back half of the manga was generating a lot of hype for more adaptation. Manga sometimes just peter out, and when you're working on an adaptation of a dying series, you don't have a ton of options to get a satisfying conclusion.

I fully expect something like Talentless Nana to wind up in the same boat if it gets another season - the first season covered half of the manga so far, but the first half of the manga is easily the more compelling half. A second season of that will almost certainly have to decide whether to try to wrap the story up or not, and who knows whether they'll have enough solid material to make that work at that point."
The Promised Neverland,I really wanna be a fly on the wall when they were planning this season out just to hear the reasoning behind the manga skip
The Promised Neverland,season 2 has had none of the fun and enjoyment that I had watching season 1.
The Promised Neverland,Sounds similar to what happened with The World God Only Knows where season 2 skipped ahead like 60 chapters and had to include asides explaining who some of the characters were.
The Promised Neverland,"I haven't been following the anime because of my lack of interested in the series, but I did read it removed Goldy Pond entirely. So, to make things work, either a massive amount needed to be changed or off-screened."
The Promised Neverland,They pretty much skipped everything.
The Promised Neverland,From what I’ve read they went right from the first arc to the last arc and skipped everything in between including the last decent arc before the manga goes to shit. I stopped watching when they felt they needed a recap after five episodes and never looked back and I have no regrets
The Promised Neverland,At least OPM kept the original story from the manga. Promised Neverland was like fuck it lets just fast forward that shit lmao.
The Promised Neverland,"I would say this is a step worse because it is a much bigger dip story-wise, in my opinion"
The Promised Neverland,I'm really worried. So many people are saying that it went from 100 to 0 and i have yet to see it.
The Promised Neverland,"Ooh, what was the controversy with Sister Krone?"
The Promised Neverland,"Wonder why they’re going straight to the end. The manga was a hit, the anime was too and the series already has a live-action movie and a show on Amazon in development. Seems odd time to just rush right to the finale."
The Promised Neverland,"Even OPM wasn't ""Bad"" yes the animation was lower quality but I think if the First season hadn't been so well received because of that animation the difference wouldn't have been as impactful"
The Promised Neverland,"From what I've read, they removed an arc and changed things. While the removed arc wasn't perfect (I read the manga), it did set up a lot of really important things and introduce important characters. It was also a small drop in quality that eased the decent. 

I'm not saying adding it would fix things, but without it the series biggest problem (pacing) is significantly worse."
The Promised Neverland,"I'd say the anime had more controversy about it then the live action adaptation the other poster linked below

Sister Krone is black and is drawn in a very caricatured way sometimes that looks somewhat similar to racist depictions. In the live-action they cast a Japanese actress to play her"
The Promised Neverland,[The movie casting](https://comicbook.com/anime/news/the-promised-neverland-movie-controversy-live-action-cast-sister-krone/).
The Promised Neverland,I wonder as well. It was so so popular during S1 and they just crushed all hopes of it being a top tier anime. I get that Covid prob messed some stuff up but why not just release a short season or something? It’s baffling.
The Promised Neverland,Weren’t most of a the fights in season 2 a slideshow? Lol
The Promised Neverland,Damn
The Promised Neverland,"This stuff gets so ridiculous. She was voiced by someone who was Japanese originally. In fact, tons of anime portray people from other countries, and they are voiced by Japanese people. 

Some day aliens will land on the planet earth and they'll be about to give us the cure for cancer and probably a bunch of other neat stuff, when we will start telling them that there is a long list of things that we find offensive and they have find those things offensive too otherwise they're bad people. And they'll probably tell us to fuck off and then leave taking all their advanced technologies with them. 

It is important to be aware of history and be respectful to people. That is absolutely reasonable. But are we really going to teach our children to be offended by things they wouldn't otherwise care about? And exporting the idea that actors can't play a role that was previously written as another race to another country that probably doesn't even have the actors available to make that work (could you imagine if this were applied to Attack on Titan?) is arrogance, it is power misapplied, and it is wrong.

**Edit**: Just to clarify, this was me going off on an rant. It isn't directed at the person I was replying to but stuff I had on my mind already."
The Promised Neverland,Almost every fight that involved Garou was well animated imo.
The Promised Neverland,"For any of you r/television junkies, lemme just say right now.

Mob Psycho 100 is one of the best anime series I've ever watched, and although Fullmetal Brotherhood is my favorite *story*, I think Mob might be my favorite anime of all time.

Between Doctor Who, Doom Patrol and Harley Quinn and now this, HBO Max has been crushing it with it's lineup."
The Promised Neverland,Is The Promised Neverland any good? Keeps popping up in different threads that I'm browsing
The Promised Neverland,"The Streaming Wars may get some flack but I for one have been loving it. Because every time I do the math, getting several Streaming Services always adds up to being much less than paying for Cable/Dish."
The Promised Neverland,time to rewatch mob then. and promise neverland been on my list for a while now it is easier to use
The Promised Neverland,Holy cow! Now this is what I'm talking about! Finally I can enjoy season 2 of Mob Psycho without relying on my boyfriend's VRV account!
The Promised Neverland,Oh sweet. I liked Aldnoah.Zero.
The Promised Neverland,Shame its not available here
The Promised Neverland,So are these shows being pulled from Crunchy and Funi?
The Promised Neverland,"The frustrating thing about this is its unclear what options they're adding these with.  The existing series seem to be a scattershot of subbed and dubbed versions, but the exclusively English-dubbed ones are missing English-subtitles, missing even closed-captions for the hearing impaired."
The Promised Neverland,"Adding to this, Mob Psycho 100 is a must watch if you like anime in any capacity. S2 has one of the best fight scenes in anime period. Not only that but it's actually a well-written slice of life that most other animes can't even scratch the surface of. You'll like it if you're into the parody style of OPM (I mean, written by the same guy), you'll like it if you're into Studio Ghibli-esque stuff (think of the end scene of first ep s2), you'll like it if you're into any ordinary shonen, it legit has that kinda appeal. The shows only barrier to entry is the art style, but you get over it after an ep or 2."
The Promised Neverland,Facts 🔥🔥🔥
The Promised Neverland,"Owning at least half of those IPs is a good way to have them.

Having bought one of the two major anime import streaming services is another good way."
The Promised Neverland,Harley Quinn is on Max now?
The Promised Neverland,They have the best lineup of all the streaming apps in my opinion.
The Promised Neverland,"Watching through Mob Pyscho 100 now - THANK YOU! I'm only on season one, episode eight, but I'm completely hooked."
The Promised Neverland,That’s a convincing plug. I’ll watch it.
The Promised Neverland,"Just googled it and it looks like they put a My Hero Academia costume on Saitama from OPM, is this intentional?!"
The Promised Neverland,highly recommend it
The Promised Neverland,"I'm pretty critical with animes, I think most modern popular ones kinda suck, but Promised Neverland is very well written, I gave it an A or 9/10."
The Promised Neverland,"Yes and no, the first season is fan-fucking-tastic and I'd highly recommend it. However the source Manga it's based off of... It... Drops the really hard after the first arc. So basically I'd highly recommend the first season (and so far only season) and just leave it at that. The rest of the story in the Manga has the fastest drop in quality I've ever seen."
The Promised Neverland,The first arc is killer but the decline in quality after it is overwhelming. It gets really bad at some points.
The Promised Neverland,Very very good
The Promised Neverland,It's based off a *very* good manga arc and does it to a inferior degree. The manga also strictly dipped in quality after that first arc so the anime is likely to follow suit. Overall it's quite good but definitely not worthy of any *the next best anime* hype you may be coming across.
The Promised Neverland,I agree. Plus there is so much more good content these days imo than there was 10+ years ago.
The Promised Neverland,You don't have many streaming services or aren't counting internet costs
The Promised Neverland,"No. Both HBO Max and Crunchyroll are owned by AT&T. Their plan seems to be for HBO Max to have some anime, but Crunchyroll/VRV will be the their main anime streaming service. Aside from the Ghibli movies, all anime on HBO Max should be on Crunchyroll. The Funimation shows should be fine until the current licensing deals expire, but even then they should be fine. Madoka Magica, for example, is an Aniplex show, and both Aniplex and Funimation are owned by Sony, so that'll stay on Funi."
The Promised Neverland,"While the art style could be seen as a barrier, I personally find it to be one of the show’s most endearing traits."
The Promised Neverland,"> Having bought one of the two major anime import streaming services 

What is the other major services"
The Promised Neverland,Coming in August.
The Promised Neverland,It ain't on mine
The Promised Neverland,"“Wow. Look at what you’ve done. This has never happened while I’m conscious before.”

That scene gave me chillllllllls."
The Promised Neverland,The original manga was made by the same guy as One Punch Man.
The Promised Neverland,"I think the second major arc is still pretty good (although nowhere near as good as the first), but yeah, everything after that isn’t really worth it."
The Promised Neverland,It really felt like the author had a great concept to start a story but had no idea what they should do after that part was over.
The Promised Neverland,Should be noted that the anime only contains the first arc
The Promised Neverland,i only use the main sub services. i dont use niche stuff like crunchy roll or criterion. hbo max netflix is more than enough for me. disney plus suck ass for a single adult. but family wise it is nice to have.
The Promised Neverland,"The average cable bill is over $200 (source [https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/](https://decisiondata.org/news/report-the-average-cable-bill-now-exceeds-all-other-household-utility-bills-combined/))

For internet on it's own I typically pay under $70. I'm certainly not spending $130 on streaming services and I'm typically subscribed to 4-6 of them, which is probably more than most people."
The Promised Neverland,"To me its a lot like One Piece. Jarring at first, but it makes it stand out, and once you start to like everything else about it, you become attached to the style associated with it"
The Promised Neverland,I think he is referring to Crunchyroll and Funimation? I know Crunchyroll falls under WarnerMedia and I think Funimation is owned by Sony.
The Promised Neverland,It comes early next month
The Promised Neverland,Bummer
The Promised Neverland,"It's made by the same author of One Punch Man.

Whereas for OPM they adapted the anime to look more like the redrawn manga, Mob Psycho tried to adapt ONE's art style into the series.

OPM was a new take on superheroes, MOB is a new take on psychic powers. 

Some of the fight scenes in Mob *easily* rival OPM, too, but there's so much fucking heart whereas OP is more, I dunno, wacky?

EDIT: I dunno why this got added as a reply to you, RegularJoe. It was supposed to be to saul, but good to see you already answered it. :D"
The Promised Neverland,"I really don't think this was the case.

The Promised Neverland really had the potential to be a significantly longer series, maybe not One Piece but around Naruto level, it's just the author kind of gave up in the middle of it. Almost every major plot thread does not pay off and we're left with a series that starts off really cool but isn't worth it. In a lot of ways like GoT."
The Promised Neverland,"There are like 4ish main ones now? Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBOMax? Then include Disney+. At least 50.50/mo + internet? More if you want higher quality and more limited commercials."
The Promised Neverland," imo you only need two a month and i use amazon prime  other things beside tv so it not really put in the tv sub section it more of a costco/samclub membership for me. then change the secondary subscription every few months based on your needs. i feel netflix is essesntial since they actually release new content every week and at least once of a month i hear culture defining show or critic darling from them. hulu doesnt have a good tv show every single month and for live tv i can just use an digital antenna, amazon tv doesnt anything killer, and then disney plus never releases new content aimed for adults minus mando which was up until december then two months off until clone wars and then like 2 months off until hamilton. there are internet bundles that is 50 dollars a month plus the 50.50 that is 100 dollars essential with the full package of networks. with 1 or 2 sub it is 70 dollars still."
The Promised Neverland,The top 8 stream platforms cost $59.94+tax a month if you are willing to use annual plans and the ad-supported plans.  I'd personally never count internet in the cost of streaming because I'd have internet regardless of whether or not I had any streaming service.
The Promised Neverland,">I'd personally never count internet in the cost of streaming

 Inherently wrong. You can't use streaming services without internet, and possibly higher internet than you otherwise would have.

>The top 8 stream platforms cost $59.94+tax a month

If you use questionable math I assume. I already listed but 5 and it was 60$. I don't think the next 3 are only going to be $10/mo. CBS all access is another 6 by itself"
The Promised Neverland,"No reason to count the cost of internet if you were going to have it regardless of streaming services.

&#x200B;

Netflix $8.99, Amazon $8.99, Hulu $5.99 w/ ads, Apple TV+ $4.99, CBS All Access $5.00 w/ ads, Peacock Premium w/ ads $4.17, HBOMAX $14.99, Disney+ $5.83."
The Promised Neverland,">No reason to count the cost of internet if you were going to have it regardless of streaming services.

 Decent internet is a required cost of streaming. 

>Netflix $8.99

1 device in *SD*. I don't know who would have this, but ok, sure, with that savings, you come under 60"
The Promised Neverland,"**DO** watch the second season. It's hilariously bad. Like, amazingly terrible. There's not a single thing they did right.

Truly a incredible achievement in how to ruin a franchise. You should watch it for that alone."
The Promised Neverland,"Now guys give it a chance. Maybe the dub will fix the *checks notes* nightmarish pacing problems, dumb fucking ending, and skipping several important and great arcs

Yeah fuck that don’t watch it."
The Promised Neverland,Do not watch this season. It’s bad. Plain as day
The Promised Neverland,"Again, Do not watch this season. It’s bad. Plain as day. The Promised Neverland is a one season series similar to One Punch Man."
The Promised Neverland,"Haven't read anything positive about S2, but I enjoyed S1 enough that I'll give it a chance"
The Promised Neverland,You can get the entire original manga series for about 3 bucks via a Jump app subscription. Do that instead of watching this horribly cut-apart tv series.
The Promised Neverland,"I've seen adaptations take artistic liberties with anime-only content or filler episodes (*glares at Naruto Shippuden*) so that they'll catch up with the manga. There's cases like FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood where they rebooted the show as a faithful adaptation of the manga, or InuYasha: The Final Act where they covered the last manga volumes five years after the show ended.

I've never seen a show have a majority of the source material to work with and proceed to do a half-ass adaptation. I didn't get to watch this season (I stopped at episode 3) but based on what I've seen from other anime reviewers, large chunks of the original storyline as well as pivotal story arc were missing or rearranged. I already finished reading the manga, I know the later half and the ending was meh. However, I was looking forward to the show due to its engrossing story. Makes me wonder how the anime-only viewers will feel about this season."
The Promised Neverland,What is the name of the song in the trailer?
The Promised Neverland,"OPM season 2 was fine. The only thing weaker about it than S1 was the animation, it adapted the source material just fine."
The Promised Neverland,What if I liked OPM S2
The Promised Neverland,"I liked the music. The OP and ED were lit. The first few episodes were kinda promising, but it all comes crashing down into a raging dumpster fire soon after that."
The Promised Neverland,OPM2 is a good season that just doesn’t live up to 1 because of the animation quality drop. TPN2 is like if they skipped everything good to get to a dog shit version of a solid ending. I legitimately cannot think of a reason why they did what they did considering how popular it is.
The Promised Neverland,"TPN S2 is far, far worse than OPM S2"
The Promised Neverland,"There are people that like ex-arm 🤷‍♂️. OPM S2 needs that Fruit Basket remake treatment, but TPM S2 is leaps and bounds worst."
The Promised Neverland,"I don't think OPM S2 was so bad it would justify a remake, it just needs to be continued so we can see all of the Human Monster arc with Garou."
The Promised Neverland,DO NOT WATCH THIS TRAILER IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY WITHOUT SPOILERS. this show is cliffhanger after cliffhanger and watching any of them before the build up is a disservice to this awesome anime.
The Promised Neverland,"I've seen only a few of the shows you've mentioned. The Promised Neverland, season 1 and Crash Landing on You were both great. Love + Death + Robots was okay. Perhaps because it was a bunch of disconnected stories, I haven't bother to finish it yet.

While I don't know if 2019 truly stands out from other years, I will add the following shows from that year:

* Swamp Thing
* Hanna
* Doom Patrol
* Carnival Row
* The Boys
* Pennyworth
* Beforeigners
* Evil
* Deadly Class"
The Promised Neverland,"I agree but for my favorites are a bit different than yours. I really liked the Mandalorian, Watchmen, His Dark Materials, The Imagineering Story, and The Boys. 2019 was also a pretty good year for movies too but that's a different topic lol"
The Promised Neverland,"Thank you, discovered Dead Pixels from this and will try it esp as I loved Mythic Quest"
The Promised Neverland,"This one was in my drafts for a while. I didn't even bother proofreading or anything so sorry for any bad grammar or misspellings.   
  
But you get the point, 2019 was an incredible year for TV shows, and to further add to that point, I didn't even add the 2nd seasons of **Dark**, **Succession**, and **Vida**; or the final seasons of **The Affair**, **Mr. Robot**, **Legion**, and **You're the Worst**, which all came out in 2019 and were all great. And of course there was **Dickinson** (*one of my favorites as you can tell*), **The Boys** and **Sex Education** as well. Fuck! It's like every TV writer and producer was on Adderall and molly that year, because the sheer amounts of creativity that came out of the television medium that year was just insane!   
  
p.s. I watched a French sci-fi romance series a while back, pretty sure it was 2019. It was about a man who found a time-travelling box in his basement/garage, and travelled back and forth from past to present trying to save the relationship he once had with the love of his life. I thought it was an interesting way to do a time travelling series, but I can't for the love of god remember the title. 😩"
The Promised Neverland,Holy shit. 100% forgot that Watchmen was 2019. lol.
The Promised Neverland,You're welcome. 😊
The Promised Neverland,"They'd have to film this series absurdly fast or age up the children, which itself would change the plot.

Otherwise, unlike other series, this one isn't TOO wild to think of in live-action."
The Promised Neverland,"Steins Gate, Cowboy Bebop, The Promised Neverland

I'm very scared, but also very excited."
The Promised Neverland,The Promised Neverland S1 is a masterpiece of an anime and would probably work very well as a live adaptation. That being said r/manga has mixed feelings about the material past season 1.
The Promised Neverland,I've been reading the manga and the series took a downturn after the Town/Wild Hunt arc.
Preso No. 1,I think people forget how much laugh track is in that 70s show. I've seen a lot of comments around that That 90s show uses it excessively. I rewatched that 70s show not too long ago and found it comparable in terms of how much laugh track there is in both shows.
Preso No. 1,"My wife and i are both enjoying that 90s show. 

Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

I guess the producers learned to use generic music to not have the same music problems that 70s show and Wkrp had. Its fun going oh this kinda sounds like Primus."
Preso No. 1,"My only real gripe with That 90s show is the lighting. Everything seems way too bright and the shadows are distracting. I don’t remember that being a problem in the original. 

Other than that it’s nice to see the gang back, hopefully the younger actors get into more of a groove if they get another season."
Preso No. 1,"The 90's show was just dumb fun. It was just enough 'memberberries' mixed with something fresh. It isn't changing cinema history, but its enjoyable if you liked the 70's show."
Preso No. 1,"I just finished that 90’s show today. I liked it! If you’re a fan of that 70’s show it’s definitely worth watching. Kitty and Red are great, good cameos, just have to get past the so-so script"
Preso No. 1,"Look, all I'm saying is if Leia turned 15 in the summer of 1995, then she was conceived while Eric was still in Africa."
Preso No. 1,"Context from the article.

> That ’90s Show made its entrance onto the Netflix Top 10 for the week of January 16 to January 22, **after only three days on the service.**"
Preso No. 1,Ginny & Georgia is definitely getting another season.
Preso No. 1,"As expected this is the first week since November 14th-20th that no show has hit the 100,000,000 hours mark. It signals the lowest week in engagement for Netflix in over two months! 

Ginny & Georgia’s third week topped in raw viewership hours (87,400,000) but only hit second top in the more comparable equivalent complete viewings metric where it did 9 million. Which was a -46% drop between weeks 2 and 3. Analysts cite an over 50% week 2 to 3 drop as a potential harbinger of cancellation. At this point Ginny & Georgia looks pretty good for a third season. 

One interesting thing to note about Ginny & Georgia was the fact that Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos highlighted it this week in an interview by stating it did “very well” domestically in the US but was not great internationally. 

That 90s Show was the surprise hit of the week. Its 41,080,000 hours worked out at 10.6 million to top the equivalent complete viewings chart for the week! It is the first new 30 minutes comedy in ages to top 10 million in a single week. It also ensured Netflix had the one show over 10 million with G&G and Wednesday dipping below it and Vikings Valhalla s2 not getting a second week boost. Last week I predicted zero Netflix shows going above 10 million and That 90s Show has proved me wrong. Fair play to That 90s Show. The overall numbers are not great by any stretch of the imagination but I’d argue they are pretty good by Netflix 30 minute comedy standards. 

Not a good second week for Vikings Valhalla s2. It did 8.7 million (+1%). It is trending for around 24-25 million over 4 weeks which is cancellation numbers. Lucky for Vikings Valhalla fans it was ordered for 3 seasons upfront. This just means the third season will definitely be the final season. 

Wednesday only dropped -21% to garner a fantastic 9th week haul of 6.8 million. It is the gift that keeps on giving for Netflix just like Squid Game! 

Kaleidoscope (between 28.4-30.4 million), The Glory (25.9 million), and Alpha Males (between 8-10.1 million) finished their 4 week runs on Netflix. Very solid for The Glory. Disappointing but not a total flop for Kaleidoscope and OK for Alpha Males. Treason also finished its 4 week run be we cannot give an accurate estimate as it missed the chart in 2/4 weeks. It did deliver 21.5 million in the two weeks it did chart though so it probably performed similarly to Kaleidoscope. 

It was another quiet week for the other new shows. Woman At War (3.6 million), Fauda s4 (1.4 million), and Shahmaran (2.5 million) all charted with low numbers while shows with lower runtimes Represent (less than 3.5 million) and Shantytown (less than 3 million) missed the charts. Bling Empire New York (less than 2.2 million) just flopped and missed the charts. 

The big show next week is Lockwood and Co but I have to admit I’m not expecting it to do above 8 million. With That 90s Show also due to fade in the second week as shows with short runtimes tend to do I’m again calling a week where Netflix will not have a show hit double figures in equivalent complete viewings!"
Preso No. 1,"I found that 90’s show okay… few things were off, but I would watch another season easily. I don’t think it’s 70’s show quality yet as even the 70’s show wasn’t that in the first season."
Preso No. 1,"I didn’t watch That 70s Show but I really liked That 90s Show. I’m not usually a fan of these multi cam sit coms but as someone who grew up in the 90s it’s extremely nostalgic. Not just the references (which were smart in the appropriate for the time but modern audiences will still get them kind of way) but in the way it’s shot, edited, the way the sets look etc. 

I laughed a lot too- I think Sherri was my favourite. The kids took a couple of episodes to click but I wanted to see more of them by the end. If you’re “of a certain age” like me and are in the mood for something fun and lighthearted I’d recommend it even if you haven’t seen the original (from the audience reactions it’s obvious who is a returning character - felt a bit bad for Leia who came in to complete silence haha)

Edit- Looks like James Iha from Smashing Pumpkins wrote the music too!"
Preso No. 1,"Pretty enjoyable binge, liked it way more than I anticipated. I was a fan of the original. I thought it was weird how they did the cameos from that cast, except for Chong, he was epic as always."
Preso No. 1,These kids look too young to smoke weed
Preso No. 1,Ozzie single-handedly drags the show down hard
Preso No. 1,"I’m two episodes in, it’s pretty good for what it is but I cannot stand the Asian kid for the life of me."
Preso No. 1,I think it’s fun.
Preso No. 1,I really enjoyed that 90s show. I’m hoping for a second season.
Preso No. 1,I've been really enjoying That 90s Show. It's not perfect but neither was 70s
Preso No. 1,It’s far from perfect but I’m definitely loving that 90s show(as a die hard that 70s show fan)
Preso No. 1,"I wasn’t expecting to even like it and I LOVED it, totally what I wanted!"
Preso No. 1,"I was surprised by how decent ""That 90's Show"" turned out to be. 

I thought everything involving the original cast was gold! I didn't like the new kids at first, but they grew on me by the end."
Preso No. 1,[removed]
Preso No. 1,"I watched the pilot, went to that 70s show for a few episodes which helped me get in the right mood, came back to watch the rest of that 90s show and enjoyed it"
Preso No. 1,All I know is that I laughed at the show and absolutely loved it!
Preso No. 1,"The kids just don't have ""it"" like the first group. The original cast just seemed so natural like they weren't even acting. The new group's acting got a little bit better towards the end, but most of the time they just weren't very good. I am also still confused why they had to have two ""dumb"" guys that are really similar. Whyyyy? Really wish they had just created some new personalities instead of just reworking the old ones."
Preso No. 1,"Only 5th, time to brace for that cancellation."
Preso No. 1,Only 41m hours watched? Well looks like Netflix is gonna cancel it next!
Preso No. 1,"Good, maybe that means they'll get a bigger budget for set design and costuming for future seasons."
Preso No. 1,"It really stinks that Danny masterson is a piece of shit because I could totally see Hyde owning and running the Hub and being integrated in the show there

And if Lisa Robin Kelly stayed away from drugs, and dying, i feel like she would be the Sherri character"
Preso No. 1,"I hope they can find a way to bring the older characters back more honestly. Their small moments were the best parts. The kids were fine but I think they're too young collectively. They're all 15-18 whereas the original crew was like 15-22 lol. 

Maybe they'll be better when they've gotten more experienced but as it is they feel a little awkward. Half of them were on Nickelodeon kids shows and you can tell by the way their timing is."
Preso No. 1,"This show is worth the watch if you were a fan of That 70's Show... Red and Kitty are 100% the draw here.  The new cast of kids was lackluster.  Representation was the goal, not the acting.  I could have used 4-6 more episodes to try to find the bond with the new cast.  The guest appearances were all pretty good.  Also, it has been said before, but the laugh track may have been slightly overused."
Preso No. 1,I went in thinking is was going to be another awful sequel/reboot series. But I really enjoyed it a lot. I really would want to watch another season of this. Plus Red And Kitty were fantastic!
Preso No. 1,I thought “That 90s Show” was going to end up another annoying teen drama that makes them learn all the lessons and become better people but it truly does mimic the feeling of it’s predecessor and was truly funny.  I was going to skip but my husband put it on and I thought it was great.
Preso No. 1,">debuts at No. 5 on Netflix

Well, it had a good run. Hopefully they get a season 2 to wrap up the storylines nicely."
Preso No. 1,Is The 90s Show any good?  I watched like the first few minutes but the constant shrieking of the studio audience every time a member of the old show walked onto screen really grated me.
Preso No. 1,Gina and georgia is overrated imo
Preso No. 1,That 70s show Cameos were better than the actual show
Preso No. 1,"I couldn't stand Ozzie, the over-the-top melodramatic, deadpan, gay character. I just don't think he had a reason to exist in the show, he didn't do much and his character could be incorporated into one of the _other_ characters to give them more depth.

I just think it would have a better impact on/in the show (as well as the LGBT+ community) if the lead actress (Leia) was gay or bi. Plus I thought there was instant ""clickability"" with Gwen as opposed to Jay.

But at face value it was a good enough time. More of a time-killer show but this was only the first season."
Preso No. 1,Found it cringy and horribly acted.
Preso No. 1,That 90s Show isn't Velma levels of bad but it's not particularly memorable in any way other than the cameos from the original cast. The love triangle thing they try to pull at the very last minute was VERY weak. The new cast doesn't have the same level of chemistry. They all just come across very cringy.
Preso No. 1,I tried that 90s show but I can't get past the first episode. It's so awful.
Preso No. 1,"That 90s show wasn't good. I wasn't a fan of the original either. The kids acting did not win me over. 

Also, I'm just weird and like to pick things apart. My example is the lazy prop design. When they get the tap for the Keg they are in a store with Doritos that have today's design... Not the 90s design othat Doritos was using back then. At the video store they had the new Sour Patch kids logo with the candy kids when it should of been the older design of the blonde kid. Also Jurassic Park: The Lost World was sitting on the shelf. That movie came out in 97... this was set in the summer of 95. I mean there were a lot more prop errors, but those were a few I remember. If you are going to make a ""period"" piece, you should at least go all out on the props and make them resemble the time period that the show is set in."
Preso No. 1,Loved That 70s Show. Could hardly watch That 90s Show. Felt like I was watching Full House with some weed jokes.
Preso No. 1,Couldn’t even make it through 10 minutes. The writing is awful
Preso No. 1,"This show sucked until I got high, then it was okay. 

It’s missing something, maybe it’s legs, maybe the fact that the 90s is somewhat hard to spot in todays 90s revival that’s been in vogue for a bit."
Preso No. 1,How many episodes are people watching? That's what I want to know. Slogging through all of them seems painful.
Preso No. 1,Oy That 90's Show was horrible. Kitty and Red are okay but the original vibe is gone. The original actors who ran in seemed super forced. It won't last as a show.
Preso No. 1,I could not get through the first episode of Ginny and Georgia. Does it get better? I wonder if I should give it another try
Preso No. 1,"None of this matters, as Netflix cancels super popular shows constantly."
Preso No. 1,The gay Asian kid steals the show
Preso No. 1,Couldn’t finish the first episode
Preso No. 1,Netflix Top 10 is a useless list.
Preso No. 1,"Honest question, why is Hollywood always promoting gay Asian boys? It's disproportional to IRL stats."
Preso No. 1,Uh... So Ginny & Georgia is one of Netflix's 5 biggest shows?
Preso No. 1,Another show with the gey agenda shoehorned in
Preso No. 1,how do people watch shit like ginny and georgia
Preso No. 1,Unwatchable. Utter garbage.
Preso No. 1,Are Netflix releasing streaming numbers now or is it just to showcase how successful their originals are?. I remember some creators complaining they wouldn't let them know how their shows were doing.
Preso No. 1,Is Ginny & Georgina that good of a show?
Preso No. 1,proving people will watch anything if marketed right
Preso No. 1,That show is giving me strong “Girl Meets World” vibes.
Preso No. 1,I liked it for what it was. But… can we just talk about Ozzie wearing the (2004 version) Phantom of the Opera shirt?
Preso No. 1,That 90s is horrible. Show sucks.
Preso No. 1,"First time I've heard about Ginny & Georgia, but from seeing what it is, ""Ginny Miller, an angsty fifteen-year-old"" yeah I don't think it would be recommended for me either, nor would I care if it was. 

I'd imagine most of the top shows I would not know tbh. There's so many of them crappy (i mean actually crappy, not just by my estimation) romantic bullshit shows/movies that do insane numbers. But then again, I like some shitty action bullshit too. So to each their own."
Preso No. 1,"That 90s Show is going pretty bad. The kids characters are completely vanilla and the actors can’t act for shit.
They also forgot the jokes.

The fact Ginny is beating it and remains at no1 after a month illustrates just who is watching Netflix most of the time these days - middle aged housewives"
Preso No. 1,If there was an award for the most unfunny group of teenagers they would be taking the prize. Not even Kitty and Red could save this disaster
Preso No. 1,"I haven’t seen it but I’ve heard there’s no reference to Hyde, who was an integral part of “That 70’s Show” due to baseless accusations being lobbed at him."
Preso No. 1,ginny and georgia debuts at number 1 again and still people do not think netflix is a woman tv station lol
Preso No. 1,"Welp,  must be time netflix cancelled it, if it's doing so well......."
Preso No. 1,I left it on and watched like 20% while it played the entire season
Preso No. 1,I got halfway through the 2nd episode before I realized how awful the show was
Preso No. 1,It sucks and it's nothing like the 90s were.
Preso No. 1,"I remember liking That 70s show, but I couldn’t even make it half way through the first episode of That 90s show…"
Preso No. 1,"Not that bad of a show. I never wanted to turn it off at any point, but it didn't scream anything special. I would expect for it to do well they'd want to do 6 month cycles sort of idea just to have enough 30-minute episodes to go with the ages of the actors.

Seasons for these are usually much longer, and it feels super short otherwise. If it was an hour long episode series, then I would see the justification of just 10."
Preso No. 1,"I watched it, mostly out of nostalgia and wasn't impressed"
Preso No. 1,I just feel like they really missed the mark and kinda Disney-fied it? Shit was grunge and depressing and we liked it that way and talked about dying a lot and womens empowerment especially through powerful women singers and too much black eyeliner that always looked like you slept in it and there was definitely weed and drinking.
Preso No. 1,So it will be canceled in 3 seasons instead of 2
Preso No. 1,"That 90's show is not good, sorry. I also did not like that 80's show either. Stop messing with the original. Next they will do a That 2000's Show and it will also not be good either."
Preso No. 1,"Red and Kitty are a delight, but the rest is atrocious."
Preso No. 1,"That 90s show was way better than I expected. I was not expecting much, but it got me to watch the entire season. I did enjoy it, and I am sure the characters will grow on me if it continues. My only gripe was age of the teenagers and not expanding personalities a little more. Jay and Nate are too similar. The girls are fine sometimes a little much, Ozzie needs time to expand a bit. He’s just kind of the deadpan silence breaker right now. Would like to see him expand a bit. Show wasn’t amazing but I can see myself sticking around for more."
Preso No. 1,"That '90s Show was really good; I just wish it was 22 episodes long rather than 10. It feels over before it's even began.

Hopefully it ends Netflix's sitcom dry spell; if you can call it a dry spell as remained unbroken since their inception. Even Kimmy Schmidt wasn't originally meant for Netflix."
Preso No. 1,It's almost as if both shows were taped in front of a live audience...
Preso No. 1,It's a multi-camera sitcom. How do people expect anything else?
Preso No. 1,"I think a lotta people fail to realize that sitcoms are corny by nature. The first season of any sitcom can be rough. When compared to the other recent Netflix sitcoms, that 90s show has been great. I couldn’t make 5 min in to that god awful blockbuster one"
Preso No. 1,"I loved That 70s Show and the 90s version is almost a pitch-perfect continuation. 

I'm really enjoying it, but I think that comes from my love of the original. My wife who never watched it doesn't get it."
Preso No. 1,"I feel like people look back on That 70s Show with rose-tinted glasses. That 70s Show didn't start out amazing either. 

So far I feel like the writing/jokes of that 90s show is on par with it's predecessor. It feels really similar to me. I think the style of humor just feels dated these days, but I enjoyed it for what it is. Not as good as That 70s Show, but good enough to be the successor (and to give the benefit of the doubt that it could improve) imo."
Preso No. 1,"Yeah, I get the sense from some of the critical comments, that a lot of people just haven’t watched a multi-camera sitcom in like a decade."
Preso No. 1,"Not a track, both shows were filmed in front of a live audience"
Preso No. 1,I think the issue is the cast in the 70s show actually seemed to be laughing at stuff. In this the cast is over the top to try and make jokes but it keeps falling flat.
Preso No. 1,"No one forgot, but That 70's Show came out 25 years ago. Laugh tracks were everywhere back then, so you just accepted it as a fact of life. However, in 2023, there's really no excuse to use a laugh track."
Preso No. 1,I watched a whole 30 seconds of That '90s Show before I remembered I hated everything with a laugh track.
Preso No. 1,"While I agree, I just feel like it was less forced in that 70s show. I couldn’t get through one episode of 90s. You sorta cringed and every showing of the original cast was like coming up for air"
Preso No. 1,"Hijacking the top comment to ask: How did they handle Hyde? Was he even mentioned? It'll be forever before I get around to this, someone please just spoil it for me."
Preso No. 1,"I think it’s a decent first season. They’ve got a LOT of room for improvement, but it’s not the total dumpster fire that some comments want it to be"
Preso No. 1,"Yeah, just finished it. It was a show. I giggled from time to time. Which as it turns out was everything i needed from it."
Preso No. 1,I was surprised to hear a Pantera song during a gym scene.
Preso No. 1,">Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

Perfect synopsis. Watched all 10 episodes on a binge and it didn't change my life or anything, but it was a nice, lil show to watch while I had nothing to do. Nothing wrong with that in my book."
Preso No. 1,">Its not life changing but its a good just chill and watch tv show.

Agreed. And in this era of so much ""prestige"" television... I'm pretty happy that it's just a fun nice show. Sometimes that's all I really want."
Preso No. 1,"I mean there’s a lot of popular songs in the show, like no rain, groove is in the heart, I wish"
Preso No. 1,I’m watching it in picture to picture on my phone and it’s pretty enjoyable in the background. Love seeing all the old characters pop up too.
